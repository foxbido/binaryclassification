1	lovingly with you 
1	i conn d old times 
1	i sat studying at the feet of the great masters 
1	in the name of these states shall i scorn the antique

1	night between all the states and between any two of them 
1	and i will make a song for the ears of the president full of
1	weapons with menacing points 
1	and behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces 
1	and a song make i of the one form d out of all 
1	the fang d and glittering one whose head is over all

1	have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems 
1	i have heard what the talkers were talking the talk of the
1	beginning and the end 
1	but i do not talk of the beginning or the end 
1	there was never any more inception than there is now 
1	nor any more youth or age than there is now 
1	and will never be any more perfection than there is now 
1	nor any more heaven or hell than there is now 
1	urge and urge and urge 
1	always the procreant urge of the world 
1	out of the dimness opposite equals advance always substance and
1	increase always sex 
1	sure as the most certain sure plumb in the uprights well
1	entretied braced in the beams 
1	stout as a horse affectionate haughty electrical

1	knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things while they
1	discuss i am silent and go bathe and admire myself 
1	less familiar than the rest

1	and forthwith cipher and show me to a cent 
1	trippers and askers surround me 
1	the real or fancied indifference of some man or woman i love 
1	these come to me days and nights and go from me again 
1	but they are not the me myself 
1	apart from the pulling and hauling stands what i am 
1	stands amused complacent compassionating idle unitary 
1	both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it 
1	backward i see in my own days where i sweated through fog with
1	linguists and contenders 
1	i have no mockings or arguments i witness and wait 
1	loafe with me on the grass loose the stop from your throat 
1	not words not music or rhyme i want not custom or lecture not
1	even the best 
1	only the lull i like the hum of your valved voice 
1	i mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning 
1	to my bare stript heart 
1	and i know that the hand of god is the promise of my own 
1	and i know that the spirit of god is the brother of my own 
1	and that a kelson of the creation is love 
1	and limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields 
1	and brown ants in the little wells beneath them 
1	or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord 
1	a scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt 
1	bearing the owner s name someway in the corners that we may see
1	and remark and say whose 
1	or i guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic 
1	and it means sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones 
1	growing among black folks as among white 
1	kanuck tuckahoe congressman cuff i give them the same i
1	receive them the same 
1	and now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves 
1	tenderly will i use you curling grass 
1	it may be you transpire from the breasts of young men 
1	it may be if i had known them i would have loved them 
1	and here you are the mothers laps 
1	dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths 
1	o i perceive after all so many uttering tongues 
1	soon out of their laps 
1	what do you think has become of the young and old men 
1	and what do you think has become of the women and children 
1	they are alive and well somewhere 
1	the smallest sprout shows there is really no death 
1	and ceas d the moment life appear d 
1	all goes onward and outward nothing collapses 
1	and to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier 
1	has any one supposed it lucky to be born 
1	and peruse manifold objects no two alike and every one good 
1	the earth good and the stars good and their adjuncts all good 
1	i am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth 
1	i am the mate and companion of people all just as immortal and
1	fathomless as myself 
1	 they do not know how immortal but i know 
1	every kind for itself and its own for me mine male and female 
1	for me those that have been boys and that love women 
1	mothers of mothers 
1	for me lips that have smiled eyes that have shed tears 
1	for me children and the begetters of children 
1	undrape you are not guilty to me nor stale nor discarded 
1	i see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no 
1	the little one sleeps in its cradle 
1	the suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom 
1	the heavy omnibus the driver with his interrogating thumb the
1	clank of the shod horses on the granite floor 
1	the snow sleighs clinking shouted jokes pelts of snow balls 
1	the hurrahs for popular favorites the fury of rous d mobs 
1	the impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes 
1	give birth to babes 
1	the big doors of the country barn stand open and ready 
1	the dried grass of the harvest time loads the slow drawn wagon 
1	the clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged 
1	the armfuls are pack d to the sagging mow 
1	i am there i help i came stretch d atop of the load 
1	i felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other 
1	i jump from the cross beams and seize the clover and timothy 
1	and roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps 
1	alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt 
1	wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee 
1	in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night 
1	kindling a fire and broiling the fresh kill d game 
1	the boatmen and clam diggers arose early and stopt for me 
1	hanging from their shoulders 
1	the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside 
1	i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile 
1	coarse clean clothes 
1	twenty eight young men bathe by the shore 
1	twenty eight young men and all so friendly 
1	twenty eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome 
1	she owns the fine house by the rise of the bank

1	where are you off to lady for i see you

1	the wild gander leads his flock through the cool night 
1	ya honk he says and sounds it down to me like an invitation 
1	the pert may suppose it meaningless but i listening close 
1	find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky 
1	the litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats 
1	the brood of the turkey hen and she with her half spread wings

1	to behold the day break 
1	the little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows 
1	the air tastes good to my palate 
1	hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising
1	freshly exuding 
1	scooting obliquely high and low 
1	something i cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs 
1	seas of bright juice suffuse heaven 
1	the mocking taunt see then whether you shall be master 
1	dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun rise would kill me 
1	if i could not now and always send sun rise out of me 
1	we also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun 
1	we found our own o my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak 
1	my voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach 
1	speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measure itself 
1	walt you contain enough why don t you let it out then 
1	come now i will not be tantalized you conceive too much of
1	articulation 
1	do you not know o speech how the buds beneath you are folded 
1	waiting in gloom protected by frost 
1	the dirt receding before my prophetical screams 
1	i underlying causes to balance them at last 
1	i crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you 
1	writing and talk do not prove me 
1	i carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face 
1	with the hush of my lips i wholly confound the skeptic 
1	now i will do nothing but listen 
1	i hear the sound i love the sound of the human voice 
1	i hear all sounds running together combined fused or following 
1	work people at their meals 
1	the heave e yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves the
1	refrain of the anchor lifters 
1	i hear the violoncello tis the young man s heart s complaint 
1	it shakes mad sweet pangs through my belly and breast 
1	i hear the chorus it is a grand opera 
1	ah this indeed is music this suits me 
1	a tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me 
1	the orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full 
1	i hear the train d soprano what work with hers is this 
1	the orchestra whirls me wider than uranus flies 
1	it wrenches such ardors from me i did not know i possess d them 
1	and that we call being 
1	to be in any form what is that 
1	 round and round we go all of us and ever come back thither 
1	mine is no callous shell 
1	i have instant conductors all over me whether i pass or stop 
1	they seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me 
1	i merely stir press feel with my fingers and am happy 
1	is this then a touch quivering me to a new identity 
1	flames and ether making a rush for my veins 
1	treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them 
1	my flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly
1	on all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs 
1	straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip 
1	behaving licentious toward me taking no denial 
1	depriving me of my best as for a purpose 
1	unbuttoning my clothes holding me by the bare waist 
1	then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me 
1	the sentries desert every other part of me 
1	they have left me helpless to a red marauder 
1	they all come to the headland to witness and assist against me 
1	i am given up by traitors 
1	i talk wildly i have lost my wits i and nobody else am the
1	greatest traitor 
1	parting track d by arriving perpetual payment of perpetual loan 
1	all truths wait in all things 
1	they neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it 
1	they do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon 
1	the insignificant is as big to me as any 
1	 what is less or more than a touch 
1	logic and sermons never convince 
1	the damp of the night drives deeper into my soul 
1	 only what proves itself to every man and woman is so 
1	only what nobody denies is so 
1	a minute and a drop of me settle my brain 
1	i believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps 
1	and a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman 
1	becomes omnific 
1	and until one and all shall delight us and we them 
1	and the tree toad is a chef d oeuvre for the highest 
1	and the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven 
1	and the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery 
1	and the cow crunching with depress d head surpasses any statue 
1	and a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels 
1	i find i incorporate gneiss coal long threaded moss fruits 
1	grains esculent roots 
1	and am stucco d with quadrupeds and birds all over 
1	and have distanced what is behind me for good reasons 
1	but call any thing back again when i desire it 
1	in vain the speeding or shyness 
1	in vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes 
1	in vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs 
1	in vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods 
1	in vain the razor bill d auk sails far north to labrador 
1	i stand and look at them long and long 
1	they do not sweat and whine about their condition 
1	they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins 
1	they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god 
1	not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania of
1	owning things 
1	not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth 
1	so they show their relations to me and i accept them 
1	they bring me tokens of myself they evince them plainly in their
1	i wonder where they get those tokens 
1	did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them 
1	myself moving forward then and now and forever 
1	gathering and showing more always and with velocity 
1	infinite and omnigenous and the like of these among them 
1	not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers 
1	limbs glossy and supple tail dusting the ground 
1	his nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him 
1	i but use you a minute then i resign you stallion 
1	why do i need your paces when i myself out gallop them 
1	even as i stand or sit passing faster than you 
1	space and time now i see it is true what i guess d at 
1	what i guess d when i loaf d on the grass 
1	what i guess d while i lay alone in my bed 
1	my ties and ballasts leave me my elbows rest in sea gaps 
1	i skirt sierras my palms cover continents 
1	i am afoot with my vision 
1	crossing savannas trailing in forests 
1	prospecting gold digging girdling the trees of a new purchase 
1	scorch d ankle deep by the hot sand hauling my boat down the
1	shallow river 
1	where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead where the
1	buck turns furiously at the hunter 
1	where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock where the
1	where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou 
1	where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where the
1	beaver pats the mud with his paddle shaped tall 
1	over the sharp peak d farm house with its scallop d scum and
1	slender shoots from the gutters 
1	over the western persimmon over the long leav d corn over the
1	delicate blue flower flax 
1	goldbug drops through the dark 
1	where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous
1	shuddering of their hides 
1	myself and looking composedly down 
1	where the life car is drawn on the slip noose where the heat
1	hatches pale green eggs in the dented sand 
1	where the she whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it 
1	where the steam ship trails hind ways its long pennant of smoke 
1	at he festivals with blackguard gibes ironical license 
1	bull dances drinking laughter 
1	at apple peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit i find 
1	screams weeps 
1	where the humming bird shimmers where the neck of the long lived
1	where the laughing gull scoots by the shore where she laughs her
1	where band neck d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with
1	their heads out 
1	where burial coaches enter the arch d gates of a cemetery 
1	where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees 
1	where the yellow crown d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at
1	night and feeds upon small crabs 
1	where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon 
1	through the gymnasium through the curtain d saloon through the
1	office or public hall 
1	pleas d with the homely woman as well as the handsome 
1	looking in at the shop windows of broadway the whole forenoon 
1	flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass 
1	hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any 
1	hot toward one i hate ready in my madness to knife him 
1	speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the
1	diameter of eighty thousand miles 
1	speeding with tail d meteors throwing fire balls like the rest 
1	backing and filling appearing and disappearing 
1	i tread day and night such roads 
1	i visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product 
1	and look at quintillions ripen d and look at quintillions green 
1	i fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul 
1	my course runs below the soundings of plummets 
1	i help myself to material and immaterial 
1	no guard can shut me off no law prevent me 
1	i anchor my ship for a little while only 
1	i go hunting polar furs and the seal leaping chasms with a
1	pike pointed staff clinging to topples of brittle and blue 
1	i ascend to the foretruck 
1	i take my place late at night in the crow s nest 
1	we sail the arctic sea it is plenty light enough 
1	the white topt mountains show in the distance i fling out my
1	fancies toward them 
1	or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin d city 
1	i am a free companion i bivouac by invading watchfires 
1	i turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself 
1	i tighten her all night to my thighs and lips 
1	i understand the large hearts of heroes 
1	the courage of present times and all times 
1	how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the
1	steamship and death chasing it up and down the storm 
1	how he follow d with them and tack d with them three days and
1	would not give it up 
1	how he saved the drifting company at last 
1	how the lank loose gown d women look d when boated from the
1	side of their prepared graves 
1	how the silent old faced infants and the lifted sick and the
1	sharp lipp d unshaved men 
1	the disdain and calmness of martyrs 
1	the hounded slave that flags in the race leans by the fence 
1	blowing cover d with sweat 
1	all these i feel or am 
1	i am the hounded slave i wince at the bite of the dogs 
1	hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen 
1	ooze of my skin 
1	i fall on the weeds and stones 
1	the riders spur their unwilling horses haul close 
1	agonies are one of my changes of garments 
1	i do not ask the wounded person how he feels i myself become the
1	my hurts turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observe 
1	i am the mash d fireman with breast bone broken 
1	tumbling walls buried me in their debris 
1	they have clear d the beams away they tenderly lift me forth 
1	white and beautiful are the faces around me the heads are bared
1	of their fire caps 
1	the kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches 
1	distant and dead resuscitate 
1	i am an old artillerist i tell of my fort s bombardment 
1	i am there again 
1	again the long roll of the drummers 
1	again the attacking cannon mortars 
1	again to my listening ears the cannon responsive 
1	i take part i see and hear the whole 
1	the cries curses roar the plaudits for well aim d shots 
1	the ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip 
1	workmen searching after damages making indispensable repairs 
1	again gurgles the mouth of my dying general he furiously waves
1	with his hand 
1	he gasps through the clot mind not me mind the entrenchments 
1	now i tell what i knew in texas in my early youth 
1	 i tell not the fall of alamo 
1	not one escaped to tell the fall of alamo 
1	their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone 
1	they treated for an honorable capitulation receiv d writing and
1	seal gave up their arms and march d back prisoners of war 
1	they were the glory of the race of rangers 
1	matchless with horse rifle song supper courtship 
1	large turbulent generous handsome proud and affectionate 
1	bearded sunburnt drest in the free costume of hunters 
1	not a single one over thirty years of age 
1	the second first day morning they were brought out in squads and
1	massacred it was beautiful early summer 
1	the work commenced about five o clock and was over by eight 
1	none obey d the command to kneel 
1	some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight 
1	the three were all torn and cover d with the boy s blood 
1	at eleven o clock began the burning of the bodies 
1	would you hear of an old time sea fight 
1	would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars 
1	our foe was no skulk in his ship i tell you said he 
1	along the lower d eve he came horribly raking us 
1	we closed with him the yards entangled the cannon touch d 
1	my captain lash d fast with his own hands 
1	we had receiv d some eighteen pound shots under the water 
1	fighting at sun down fighting at dark 
1	our frigate takes fire 
1	the other asks if we demand quarter 
1	if our colors are struck and the fighting done 
1	now i laugh content for i hear the voice of my little captain 
1	only three guns are in use 
1	clear his decks 
1	the tops alone second the fire of this little battery especially
1	they hold out bravely during the whole of the action 
1	not a moment s cease 
1	serene stands the little captain 
1	he is not hurried his voice is neither high nor low 
1	his eyes give more light to us than our battle lanterns 
1	stretch d and still lies the midnight 
1	two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness 
1	near by the corpse of the child that serv d in the cabin 
1	the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully
1	curl d whiskers 
1	formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves dabs of flesh
1	the hiss of the surgeon s knife the gnawing teeth of his saw 
1	these so these irretrievable 
1	you laggards there on guard look to your arms 
1	in at the conquer d doors they crowd i am possess d 
1	embody all presences outlaw d or suffering 
1	see myself in prison shaped like another man

1	i take my place among you as much as among any 
1	the past is the push of you me all precisely the same

1	what is known i strip away 
1	i launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown 
1	the clock indicates the moment but what does eternity indicate 
1	we have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers 
1	there are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them 
1	births have brought us richness and variety 
1	and other births will bring us richness and variety 
1	i do not call one greater and one smaller 
1	that which fills its period and place is equal to any 
1	all has been gentle with me i keep no account with lamentation 
1	 what have i to do with lamentation 
1	my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs 
1	rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me 
1	afar down i see the huge first nothing i know i was even there 
1	i waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist 
1	long i was hugg d close long and long 
1	immense have been the preparations for me 
1	faithful and friendly the arms that have help d me 
1	they sent influences to look after what was to hold me 
1	before i was born out of my mother generations guided me 
1	my embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it 
1	for it the nebula cohered to an orb 
1	the long slow strata piled to rest it on 
1	vast vegetables gave it sustenance 
1	o span of youth ever push d elasticity 
1	o manhood balanced florid and full 
1	my lovers suffocate me 
1	crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin 
1	chirping over my head 
1	calling my name from flower beds vines tangled underbrush 
1	lighting on every moment of my life 
1	bussing my body with soft balsamic busses 
1	and the dark hush promulges as much as any 
1	i open my scuttle at night and see the far sprinkled systems 
1	wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding 
1	outward and outward and forever outward 
1	my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels 
1	he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit 
1	there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage 
1	not avail the long run 
1	we should surely bring up again where we now stand 
1	and surely go as much farther and then farther and farther 
1	a few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues do
1	they are but parts any thing is but a part 
1	see ever so far there is limitless space outside of that 
1	count ever so much there is limitless time around that 
1	my rendezvous is appointed it is certain 
1	the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms 
1	the great camerado the lover true for whom i pine will be there 
1	i tramp a perpetual journey come listen all 
1	i have no chair no church no philosophy 
1	i lead no man to a dinner table library exchange 
1	but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll 
1	my left hand hooking you round the waist 
1	not i not any one else can travel that road for you 
1	you must travel it for yourself 
1	it is not far it is within reach 
1	perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know 
1	and in due time you shall repay the same service to me 
1	for after we start we never lie by again 
1	be fill d and satisfied then 
1	you are also asking me questions and i hear you 
1	i answer that i cannot answer you must find out for yourself 
1	sit a while dear son 
1	here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink 
1	long enough have you dream d contemptible dreams 
1	now i wash the gum from your eyes 
1	you must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every
1	moment of your life 
1	long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore 
1	now i will you to be a bold swimmer 
1	i am the teacher of athletes 
1	the boy i love the same becomes a man not through derived power 
1	wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear 
1	fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak 
1	skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo 
1	and those well tann d to those that keep out of the sun 
1	i teach straying from me yet who can stray from me 
1	i follow you whoever you are from the present hour 
1	my words itch at your ears till you understand them 
1	i swear i will never again mention love or death inside a house 
1	if you would understand me go to the heights or water shore 
1	no shutter d room or school can commune with me 
1	but roughs and little children better than they 
1	the young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well 
1	the soldier camp d or upon the march is mine 
1	the young mother and old mother comprehend me 
1	i have said that the soul is not more than the body 
1	and i have said that the body is not more than the soul 
1	and nothing not god is greater to one than one s self is 
1	and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own
1	funeral drest in his shroud 
1	and i say to mankind be not curious about god 
1	for i who am curious about each am not curious about god 
1	 no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and
1	about death 
1	why should i wish to see god better than this day 
1	to his work without flinching the accoucheur comes 
1	i see the elder hand pressing receiving supporting 
1	i recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors 
1	and mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape 
1	i smell the white roses sweet scented and growing 
1	and as to you life i reckon you are the leavings of many deaths 
1	 no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before 
1	i hear you whispering there o stars of heaven 
1	o suns o grass of graves o perpetual transfers and promotions 
1	if you do not say any thing how can i say any thing 
1	of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest 
1	of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight 
1	toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs 
1	i ascend from the moon i ascend from the night 
1	wrench d and sweaty calm and cool then my body becomes 
1	i sleep i sleep long 
1	i do not know it it is without name it is a word unsaid 
1	it is not in any dictionary utterance symbol 
1	something it swings on more than the earth i swing on 
1	to it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me 
1	do you see o my brothers and sisters 
1	it is not chaos or death it is form union plan it is eternal
1	life it is happiness 
1	the past and present wilt i have fill d them emptied them 
1	and proceed to fill my next fold of the future 
1	listener up there what have you to confide to me 
1	look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening 
1	do i contradict myself 
1	very well then i contradict myself 
1	 i am large i contain multitudes 
1	i concentrate toward them that are nigh i wait on the door slab 
1	will you speak before i am gone will you prove already too late 
1	the spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me he complains of my gab
1	i too am not a bit tamed i too am untranslatable 
1	i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world 
1	the last scud of day holds back for me 
1	i depart as air i shake my white locks at the runaway sun 
1	i effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags 
1	i bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass i love 
1	if you want me again look for me under your boot soles 
1	you will hardly know who i am or what i mean 
1	but i shall be good health to you nevertheless 
1	and filter and fibre your blood 
1	failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged 
1	missing me one place search another 
1	i stop somewhere waiting for you 
1	to the garden the world anew ascending 
1	potent mates daughters sons preluding 
1	the love the life of their bodies meaning and being 
1	curious here behold my resurrection after slumber 
1	the revolving cycles in their wide sweep having brought me again 
1	my limbs and the quivering fire that ever plays through them for
1	existing i peer and penetrate still 
1	content with the present content with the past 
1	by my side or back of me eve following 
1	or in front and i following her just the same 
1	from pent up aching rivers 
1	from that of myself without which i were nothing 
1	from my own voice resonant singing the phallus 
1	singing the song of procreation 
1	singing the bedfellow s song o resistless yearning 
1	o for any and each the body correlative attracting 
1	from the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day 
1	from native moments from bashful pains singing them 
1	seeking something yet unfound though i have diligently sought it
1	many a long year 
1	singing the true song of the soul fitful at random 
1	renascent with grossest nature or among animals 
1	of that of them and what goes with them my poems informing 
1	of the smell of apples and lemons of the pairing of birds 
1	of the wet of woods of the lapping of waves 
1	of the mad pushes of waves upon the land i them chanting 
1	the overture lightly sounding the strain anticipating 
1	the welcome nearness the sight of the perfect body 
1	the swimmer swimming naked in the bath or motionless on his back
1	 hark close and still what i now whisper to you 
1	i love you o you entirely possess me 
1	lawless than we 
1	the furious storm through me careering i passionately trembling 
1	 o i willingly stake all for you 
1	o let me be lost if it must be so 
1	o you and i what is it to us what the rest do or think 
1	what is all else to us only that we enjoy each other and exhaust
1	from the master the pilot i yield the vessel to 
1	from privacy from frequent repinings alone 
1	from plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near 
1	from the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingers
1	through my hair and beard 
1	from the long sustain d kiss upon the mouth or bosom 
1	from the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk fainting
1	with excess 
1	from what the divine husband knows from the work of fatherhood 
1	from the act poems of eyes hands hips and bosoms 
1	from the cling of the trembling arm 
1	from the bending curve and the clinch 
1	from side by side the pliant coverlet off throwing 
1	 yet a moment o tender waiter and i return 
1	from the hour of shining stars and dropping dews 
1	from the night a moment i emerging flitting out 
1	celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for 
1	and you stalwart loins 
1	i sing the body electric 
1	the armies of those i love engirth me and i engirth them 
1	they will not let me off till i go with them respond to them 
1	and if the body were not the soul what is the soul 
1	that of the male is perfect and that of the female is perfect 
1	the expression of the face balks account 
1	contour of their shape downwards 
1	the swimmer naked in the swimming bath seen as he swims through
1	the transparent green shine or lies with his face up and rolls
1	silently to and from the heave of the water 
1	the bending forward and backward of rowers in row boats the
1	horse man in his saddle 
1	girls mothers house keepers in all their performances 
1	the group of laborers seated at noon time with their open
1	dinner kettles and their wives waiting 
1	the young fellow hosing corn the sleigh driver driving his six
1	horses through the crowd 
1	the slow return from the fire the pause when the bell strikes
1	suddenly again and the listening on the alert 
1	the natural perfect varied attitudes the bent head the curv d
1	i knew a man a common farmer the father of five sons 
1	and in them the fathers of sons and in them the fathers of sons 
1	this man was a wonderful vigor calmness beauty of person 
1	the shape of his head the pale yellow and white of his hair and
1	beard the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes the richness
1	and breadth of his manners 
1	these i used to go and visit him to see he was wise also 
1	he was six feet tall he was over eighty years old his sons were
1	they and his daughters loved him all who saw him loved him 
1	clear brown skin of his face 
1	fowling pieces presented to him by men that loved him 
1	i have perceiv d that to be with those i like is enough 
1	to stop in company with the rest at evening is enough 
1	i do not ask any more delight i swim in it as in a sea 
1	there is something in staying close to men and women and looking
1	this is the female form 
1	a divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot

1	diffused mine too diffused 
1	lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet flesh d day 
1	you are the gates of the body and you are the gates of the soul 
1	the female contains all qualities and tempers them 
1	she is in her place and moves with perfect balance 
1	she is all things duly veil d she is both passive and active 
1	as i see my soul reflected in nature 
1	as i see through a mist one with inexpressible completeness 
1	sanity beauty

1	the wholesome relief repose content 
1	and this bunch pluck d at random from myself 
1	it has done its work i toss it carelessly to fall where it may 
1	one hour to madness and joy o furious o confine me not 
1	 what is this that frees me so in storms 
1	what do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean 
1	o to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man 
1	o savage and tender achings i bequeath them to you my children 
1	o to return to paradise o bashful and feminine 
1	o the puzzle the thrice tied knot the deep and dark pool all
1	untied and illumin d 
1	o to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last 
1	to find a new unthought of nonchalance with the best of nature 
1	to have the gag remov d from one s mouth 
1	to have the feeling to day or any day i am sufficient as i am 
1	o something unprov d something in a trance 
1	to escape utterly from others anchors and holds 
1	to drive free to love free to dash reckless and dangerous 
1	to court destruction with taunts with invitations 
1	to ascend to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me 
1	to rise thither with my inebriate soul 
1	to be lost if it must be so 
1	out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me 
1	whispering i love you before long i die 
1	i have travel d a long way merely to look on you to touch you 
1	for i could not die till i once look d on you 
1	for i fear d i might afterward lose you 
1	now we have met we have look d we are safe 
1	return in peace to the ocean my love 
1	but as for me for you the irresistible sea is to separate us 
1	ocean and the land 
1	every day at sundown for your dear sake my love 
1	ages and ages returning at intervals 
1	undestroy d wandering immortal 
1	lusty phallic with the potent original loins perfectly sweet 
1	i chanter of adamic songs 
1	through the new garden the west the great cities calling 
1	offspring of my loins 
1	we two how long we were fool d
1	we two how long we were fool d 
1	now transmuted we swiftly escape as nature escapes 
1	we are nature long have we been absent but now we return 
1	we become plants trunks foliage roots bark 
1	we are bedded in the ground we are rocks 
1	we are oaks we grow in the openings side by side 
1	we browse we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any 
1	we are two fishes swimming in the sea together 
1	we are also the coarse smut of beasts vegetables minerals 
1	we are two predatory hawks we soar above and look down 
1	we are two resplendent suns we it is who balance ourselves orbic
1	we prowl fang d and four footed in the woods we spring on prey 
1	we are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead 
1	we are seas mingling we are two of those cheerful waves rolling
1	over each other and interwetting each other 
1	o hymen o hymenee why do you tantalize me thus 
1	o why sting me for a swift moment only 
1	why can you not continue o why do you now cease 
1	is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would
1	soon certainly kill me 
1	i am he that aches with love
1	i am he that aches with amorous love 
1	native moments when you come upon me ah you are here now 
1	give me now libidinous joys only 
1	give me the drench of my passions give me life coarse and rank 
1	to day i go consort with nature s darlings to night too 
1	i dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers 
1	i come forthwith in your midst i will be your poet 
1	i will be more to you than to any of the rest 
1	once i pass d through a populous city
1	yet now of all that city i remember only a woman i casually met
1	there who detain d me for love of me 
1	day by day and night by night we were together all else has long
1	i remember i say only that woman who passionately clung to me 
1	again we wander we love we separate again 
1	again she holds me by the hand i must not go 
1	i see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous 
1	i heard you solemn sweet pipes of the organ as last sunday morn i
1	winds of autumn as i walk d the woods at dusk i heard your long 
1	facing west from california s shores
1	facing west from california s shores 
1	inquiring tireless seeking what is yet unfound 
1	i a child very old over waves towards the house of maternity 
1	look off the shores of my western sea the circle almost circled 
1	now i face home again very pleas d and joyous 
1	 but where is what i started for so long ago 
1	and why is it yet unfound 
1	as adam early in the morning 
1	walking forth from the bower refresh d with sleep 
1	behold me where i pass hear my voice approach 
1	touch me touch the palm of your hand to my body as i pass 
1	be not afraid of my body 
1	in paths untrodden 
1	in the growth by margins of pond waters 
1	escaped from the life that exhibits itself 
1	from all the standards hitherto publish d from the pleasures 
1	profits conformities 
1	which too long i was offering to feed my soul 
1	here by myself away from the clank of the world 
1	tallying and talk d to here by tongues aromatic 
1	no longer abash d for in this secluded spot i can respond as i
1	would not dare elsewhere 
1	resolv d to sing no songs to day but those of manly attachment 
1	projecting them along that substantial life 
1	bequeathing hence types of athletic love 
1	afternoon this delicious ninth month in my forty first year 
1	i proceed for all who are or have been young men 
1	to tell the secret my nights and days 
1	to celebrate the need of comrades 
1	scented herbage of my breast 
1	leaves from you i glean i write to be perused best afterwards 
1	tomb leaves body leaves growing up above me above death 
1	perennial roots tall leaves o the winter shall not freeze you
1	delicate leaves 
1	every year shall you bloom again out from where you retired you
1	shall emerge again 
1	o slender leaves o blossoms of my blood i permit you to tell in
1	you are often more bitter than i can bear you burn and sting me 
1	think of death 
1	death is beautiful from you what indeed is finally beautiful
1	except death and love 
1	 i am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most 
1	do not fold yourself so in your pink tinged roots timid leaves 
1	do not remain down there so ashamed herbage of my breast 
1	come i am determin d to unbare this broad breast of mine i have
1	long enough stifled and choked 
1	i will sound myself and comrades only i will never again utter a
1	i will raise with it immortal reverberations through the states 
1	i will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will
1	through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating 
1	give me your tone therefore o death that i may accord with it 
1	that you beyond them come forth to remain the real reality 
1	that you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance 
1	whoever you are holding me now in hand 
1	without one thing all will be useless 
1	i give you fair warning before you attempt me further 
1	i am not what you supposed but far different 
1	who is he that would become my follower 
1	who would sign himself a candidate for my affections 
1	the way is suspicious the result uncertain perhaps destructive 
1	your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting 
1	put me down and depart on your way 
1	or else by stealth in some wood for trial 
1	or back of a rock in the open air 
1	 for in any roof d room of a house i emerge not nor in company 
1	here to put your lips upon mine i permit you 
1	with the comrade s long dwelling kiss or the new husband s kiss 
1	for i am the new husband and i am the comrade 
1	or if you will thrusting me beneath your clothing 
1	where i may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip 
1	carry me when you go forth over land or sea 
1	for thus merely touching you is enough is best 
1	but these leaves conning you con at peril 
1	for these leaves and me you will not understand 
1	they will elude you at first and still more afterward i will
1	certainly elude you 
1	nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me 
1	prove victorious 
1	nor will my poems do good only they will do just as much evil 
1	perhaps more 
1	for all is useless without that which you may guess at many times
1	therefore release me and depart on your way 
1	come i will make the continent indissoluble 
1	i will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon 
1	i will make divine magnetic lands 
1	with the love of comrades 
1	with the life long love of comrades 
1	by the manly love of comrades 
1	for you these from me o democracy to serve you ma femme 
1	for you for you i am trilling these songs 
1	these i singing in spring collect for lovers 
1	 wild flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and
1	partly cover them beyond these i pass 
1	far far in the forest or sauntering later in summer before i
1	think where i go 
1	collecting dispensing singing there i wander with them 
1	plucking something for tokens tossing toward whoever is near me 
1	here some pinks and laurel leaves and a handful of sage 
1	and here what i now draw from the water wading in the pondside 
1	 o here i last saw him that tenderly loves me and returns again
1	never to separate from me 
1	and this o this shall henceforth be the token of comrades this
1	calamus root shall 
1	interchange it youths with each other let none render it back 
1	and twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut 
1	and stems of currants and plum blows and the aromatic cedar 
1	these i compass d around by a thick cloud of spirits 
1	not heaving from my ribb d breast only
1	not heaving from my ribb d breast only 
1	not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself 
1	not in those long drawn ill supprest sighs 
1	not in many an oath and promise broken 
1	not in my wilful and savage soul s volition 
1	not in the subtle nourishment of the air 
1	not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists 
1	not in husky pantings through clinch d teeth 
1	nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day 
1	not in any or all of them o adhesiveness o pulse of my life 
1	of the terrible doubt of appearances 
1	of the uncertainty after all that we may be deluded 
1	that may be reliance and hope are but speculations after all 
1	that may be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only 
1	may be the things i perceive the animals plants men hills 
1	shining and flowing waters 
1	something has yet to be known 
1	to me these and the like of these are curiously answer d by my
1	lovers my dear friends 
1	i cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity
1	beyond the grave 
1	but i walk or sit indifferent i am satisfied 
1	he ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me 
1	and now gentlemen 
1	a word i give to remain in your memories and minds 
1	as base and finale too for all metaphysics 
1	 so to the students the old professor 
1	at the close of his crowded course 
1	stated the lore of plato and socrates greater than plato 
1	and greater than socrates sought and stated christ divine having
1	i see reminiscent to day those greek and germanic systems 
1	see the philosophies all christian churches and tenets see 
1	of city for city and land for land 
1	recorders ages hence 
1	come i will take you down underneath this impassive exterior i
1	will tell you what to say of me 
1	dissatisfied at night 
1	me that follow d 
1	but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health 
1	refresh d singing inhaling the ripe breath of autumn 
1	when i wander d alone over the beach and undressing bathed 
1	laughing with the cool waters and saw the sun rise 
1	and when i thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way
1	coming o then i was happy 
1	o then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food
1	nourish d me more and the beautiful day pass d well 
1	and that night while all was still i heard the waters roll slowly
1	are you the new person drawn toward me 
1	do you think it so easy to have me become your lover 
1	do you see no further than this facade this smooth and tolerant
1	manner of me 
1	roots and leaves themselves alone are these 
1	love buds put before you and within you whoever you are 
1	buds to be unfolded on the old terms 
1	if you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers 
1	fruits tall branches and trees 
1	not heat flames up and consumes 
1	not sea waves hurry in and out 
1	waited sailing gracefully to drop where they may 
1	not these o none of these more than the flames of me consuming 
1	o none more than i hurrying in and out 
1	any more than my soul is borne through the open air 
1	wafted in all directions o love for friendship for you 
1	trickle drops my blue veins leaving 
1	o drops of me trickle slow drops 
1	candid from me falling drip bleeding drops 
1	from wounds made to free you whence you were prison d 
1	from my face from my forehead and lips 
1	saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet 
1	glow upon all i have written or shall write bleeding drops 
1	let it all be seen in your light blushing drops 
1	city of orgies walks and joys 
1	spectacles repay me 
1	goods in them 
1	offering response to my own these repay me 
1	lovers continual lovers only repay me 
1	behold this swarthy face these gray eyes 
1	this beard the white wool unclipt upon my neck 
1	my brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm 
1	and i on the crossing of the street or on the ship s deck give a
1	kiss in return 
1	we observe that salute of american comrades land and sea 
1	we are those two natural and nonchalant persons 
1	i saw in louisiana a live oak growing 
1	all alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches 
1	and brought it away and i have placed it in sight in my room 
1	it is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends 
1	 for i believe lately i think of little else than of them 
1	passing stranger you do not know how longingly i look upon you 
1	i have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you 
1	all is recall d as we flit by each other fluid affectionate 
1	chaste matured 
1	you grew up with me were a boy with me or a girl with me 
1	i ate with you and slept with you your body has become not yours
1	i am to wait i do not doubt i am to meet you again 
1	i am to see to it that i do not lose you 
1	this moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone 
1	attached to them as i do to men in my own lands 
1	o i know we should be brethren and lovers 
1	i know i should be happy with them 
1	 what indeed have i in common with them or what with the
1	destruction of them 
1	and in the fields and woods and above every keel little or large
1	without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument 
1	the institution of the dear love of comrades 
1	the prairie grass dividing its special odor breathing 
1	i demand of it the spiritual corresponding 
1	demand the most copious and close companionship of men 
1	demand the blades to rise of words acts beings 
1	those of the open atmosphere coarse sunlit fresh nutritious 
1	those that go their own gait erect stepping with freedom and
1	command leading not following 
1	those with a never quell d audacity those with sweet and lusty
1	flesh clear of taint 
1	when i persue the conquer d fame
1	when i peruse the conquer d fame of heroes and the victories of
1	mighty generals i do not envy the generals 
1	we two boys together clinging 
1	one the other never leaving 
1	up and down the roads going north and south excursions making 
1	power enjoying elbows stretching fingers clutching 
1	arm d and fearless eating drinking sleeping loving 
1	no law less than ourselves owning sailing soldiering thieving 
1	a promise to california 
1	for i know very well that i and robust love belong among you 
1	inland and along the western sea 
1	here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting 
1	here i shade and hide my thoughts i myself do not expose them 
1	and yet they expose me more than all my other poems 
1	no labor saving machine 
1	nor discovery have i made 
1	nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for america 
1	nor literary success nor intellect nor book for the book shelf 
1	but a few carols vibrating through the air i leave 
1	for comrades and lovers 
1	a glimpse through an interstice caught 
1	of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar room around the stove
1	late of a winter night and i unremark d seated in a corner 
1	of a youth who loves me and whom i love silently approaching and
1	a long while amid the noises of coming and going of drinking and
1	there we two content happy in being together speaking little 
1	perhaps not a word 
1	a leaf for hand in hand 
1	you natural persons old and young 
1	you on the mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of
1	you friendly boatmen and mechanics you roughs 
1	you twain and all processions moving along the streets 
1	i wish to infuse myself among you till i see it common for you to
1	earth my likeness 
1	though you look so impassive ample and spheric there 
1	i now suspect that is not all 
1	i dare not tell it in words not even in these songs 
1	i dream d in a dream
1	i dream d that was the new city of friends 
1	and in all their looks and words 
1	what think you i take my pen in hand to record 
1	the battle ship perfect model d majestic that i saw pass the
1	offing to day under full sail 
1	the splendors of the past day or the splendor of the night that
1	envelops me 
1	to the kanadian of the north to the southerner i love 
1	friendship exalte previously unknown 
1	sometimes with one i love
1	 i loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return d 
1	yet out of that i have written these songs 
1	many things to absorb i teach to help you become eleve of mine 
1	yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins 
1	fast anchor d eternal o love 
1	fast anchor d eternal o love o woman i love 
1	ethereal the last athletic reality my consolation 
1	i ascend i float in the regions of your love o man 
1	o sharer of my roving life 
1	among the men and women the multitude 
1	i perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs 
1	some are baffled but that one is not that one knows me 
1	ah lover and perfect equal 
1	i meant that you should discover me so by faint indirections 
1	and i when i meet you mean to discover you by the like in you 
1	playing within me 
1	but among my lovers and caroling these songs 
1	o i never doubt whether that is really me 
1	full of life now compact visible 
1	i forty years old the eighty third year of the states 
1	to one a century hence or any number of centuries hence 
1	to you yet unborn these seeking you 
1	when you read these i that was visible am become invisible 
1	now it is you compact visible realizing my poems seeking me

1	i am fill d with them and i will fill them in return 
1	you road i enter upon and look around i believe you are not all
1	that is here 
1	i believe that much unseen is also here 
1	here the profound lesson of reception nor preference nor denial 
1	illiterate person are not denied 
1	you air that serves me with breath to speak

1	do you say venture not if you leave me you are lost 
1	do you say i am already prepared i am well beaten and undenied 
1	adhere to me 
1	you shall be more to me than my poem 
1	i think heroic deeds were all conceiv d in the open air and all
1	free poems also 
1	i think i could stop here myself and do miracles 
1	i think whoever i see must be happy 
1	listening to others considering well what they say 
1	pausing searching receiving contemplating 
1	i inhale great draughts of space 
1	i am larger better than i thought 
1	i did not know i held so much goodness

1	astonish me 
1	now i see the secret of the making of the best persons 
1	here a great personal deed has room 
1	 such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men 
1	its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all
1	authority and all argument against it 
1	here is the test of wisdom 
1	wisdom is not finally tested in schools 
1	now i re examine philosophies and religions 
1	here is realization 
1	here is a man tallied he realizes here what he has in him 
1	only the kernel of every object nourishes 
1	where is he who tears off the husks for you and me 
1	where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me 
1	do you know the talk of those turning eye balls 
1	here is the efflux of the soul 
1	the efflux of the soul comes from within through embower d gates 
1	why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank 
1	why are there trees i never walk under but large and melodious
1	thoughts descend upon me 
1	what is it i interchange so suddenly with strangers 
1	what with some driver as i ride on the seat by his side 
1	what gives me to be free to a woman s and man s good will what
1	gives them to be free to mine 
1	the efflux of the soul is happiness here is happiness 
1	i think it pervades the open air waiting at all times 
1	now it flows unto us we are rightly charged 
1	here rises the fluid and attaching character 
1	 the herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day
1	continually out of itself 
1	toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the
1	love of young and old

1	voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense 
1	farewell my brethren 
1	farewell o earth and sky farewell ye neighboring waters 
1	my time has ended my term has come 
1	along the northern coast 
1	just back from the rock bound shore and the caves 
1	in the saline air from the sea in the mendocino country 
1	with the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse 
1	i heard the might tree its death chant chanting 
1	the choppers heard not the camp shanties echoed not 
1	the quick ear d teamsters and chain and jack screw men heard not 
1	but in my soul i plainly heard 
1	murmuring out of its myriad leaves 
1	down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high 
1	out of its stalwart trunk and limbs out of its foot thick bark 
1	you untold life of me 
1	and all you venerable and innocent joys 
1	joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine 
1	our time our term has come 
1	nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers 
1	we who have grandly fill d our time 
1	with nature s calm content with tacit huge delight 
1	we welcome what we wrought for through the past 
1	and leave the field for them 
1	for them predicted long 
1	for a superber race they too to grandly fill their time 
1	for them we abdicate in them ourselves ye forest kings 
1	then to a loftier strain 
1	still prouder more ecstatic rose the chant 
1	as if the heirs the deities of the west 
1	joining with master tongue bore part 
1	not wan from asia s fetiches 
1	nor red from europe s old dynastic slaughter house 
1	 area of murder plots of thrones with scent left yet of wars and
1	to the new culminating man to you the empire new 
1	you promis d long we pledge we dedicate 
1	you occult deep volitions

1	for man of you your characteristic race 
1	here heed himself unfold himself not others formulas heed 
1	here fill his time 
1	to duly fall to aid unreck d at last 
1	to disappear to serve 
1	thus on the northern coast 
1	in the echo of teamsters calls and the clinking chains and the
1	music of choppers axes 
1	the century lasting unseen dryads singing withdrawing 
1	all their recesses of forests and mountains leaving 
1	from the cascade range to the wahsatch or idaho far or utah 
1	to the deities of the modern henceforth yielding 
1	the chorus and indications the vistas of coming humanity the
1	settlements features all 
1	in the mendocino woods i caught 
1	the flashing and golden pageant of california 
1	the sudden and gorgeous drama the sunny and ample lands 
1	the long and varied stretch from puget sound to colorado south 
1	at last the new arriving assuming taking possession 
1	a swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere 
1	ships coming in from the whole round world and going out to the

1	and wool and wheat and the grape and diggings of yellow gold 
1	but more in you than these lands of the western shore

1	clearing the ground for broad humanity the true america heir of
1	to build a grander future 
1	a song for occupations

1	france the th year of these states
1	a great year and place
1	i walk d the shores of my eastern sea

1	o liberty o mate for me 
1	here too though long represt can never be destroy d 
1	here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic 
1	here too demanding full arrears of vengeance 
1	hence i sign this salute over the sea 
1	and i do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism 
1	but remember the little voice that i heard wailing and wait with
1	and i send these words to paris with my love 
1	and i guess some chansonniers there will understand them 
1	for i guess there is latent music yet in france floods of it 
1	o i hear already the bustle of instruments they will soon be
1	drowning all that would interrupt them 
1	o i think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march 
1	it reaches hither it swells me to joyful madness 
1	i will run transpose it in words to justify
1	i will yet sing a song for you ma femme 
1	myself and mine gymnastic ever 
1	to stand the cold or heat to take good aim with a gun to sail a
1	not for an embroiderer 
1	not to chisel ornaments

1	i henceforth tread the world chaste temperate an early riser a
1	every hour the semen of centuries and still of centuries

1	leaving his bed wander d alone bareheaded barefoot 
1	down from the shower d halo 
1	out from the patches of briers and blackberries 
1	from the memories of the bird that chanted to me 
1	from the myriad thence arous d words 
1	from the word stronger and more delicious than any

1	pour down your warmth great sun 
1	while we bask we two together 
1	two together 
1	winds blow south or winds blow north 
1	day come white or night come black 
1	home or rivers and mountains from home 
1	singing all time minding no time 
1	while we two keep together

1	may be kill d unknown to her mate 
1	one forenoon the she bird crouch d not on the nest 
1	nor return d that afternoon nor the next 
1	nor ever appear d again 
1	and thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea 
1	and at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather 
1	over the hoarse surging of the sea 
1	or flitting from brier to brier by day 
1	i saw i heard at intervals the remaining one the he bird 
1	the solitary guest from alabama 
1	blow blow blow 
1	blow up sea winds along paumanok s shore 
1	i wait and i wait till you blow my mate to me 
1	yes when the stars glisten d 
1	all night long on the prong of a moss scallop d stake 
1	down almost amid the slapping waves 
1	sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears 
1	he call d on his mate 
1	he pour d forth the meanings which i of all men know 
1	yes my brother i know 
1	the rest might not but i have treasur d every note 
1	for more than once dimly down to the beach gliding 
1	silent avoiding the moonbeams blending myself with the shadows 
1	the white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing 
1	i with bare feet a child the wind wafting my hair 
1	listen d long and long 
1	listen d to keep to sing now translating the notes 
1	following you my brother 
1	soothe soothe soothe 
1	close on its wave soothes the wave behind 
1	and again another behind embracing and lapping every one close 
1	but my love soothes not me not me 
1	low hangs the moon it rose late 
1	it is lagging o i think it is heavy with love with love 
1	o madly the sea pushes upon the land 
1	with love with love 
1	o night do i not see my love fluttering out among the breakers 
1	what is that little black thing i see there in the white 
1	loud loud loud 
1	loud i call to you my love 
1	high and clear i shoot my voice over the waves 
1	surely you must know who is here is here 
1	you must know who i am my love 
1	low hanging moon 
1	what is that dusky spot in your brown yellow 
1	o it is the shape the shape of my mate 
1	o moon do not keep her from me any longer 
1	land land o land 
1	for i am almost sure i see her dimly whichever way i look 
1	o rising stars 
1	o throat o trembling throat 
1	sound clearer through the atmosphere 
1	pierce the woods the earth 
1	somewhere listening to catch you must be the one i want 
1	shake out carols 
1	solitary here the night s carols 
1	carols of lonesome love death s carols 
1	carols under that lagging yellow waning moon 
1	o under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea 
1	o reckless despairing carols 
1	but soft sink low 
1	soft let me just murmur 
1	and do you wait a moment you husky nois d sea 
1	for somewhere i believe i heard my mate responding to me 
1	so faint i must be still be still to listen 
1	hither my love 
1	here i am here 
1	with this just sustain d note i announce myself to you 
1	this gentle call is for you my love for you 
1	do not be decoy d elsewhere 
1	that is the whistle of the wind it is not my voice 
1	that is the fluttering the fluttering of the spray 
1	those are the shadows of leaves 
1	o darkness o in vain 
1	o i am very sick and sorrowful
1	o brown halo in the sky near the moon drooping upon the sea 
1	o troubled reflection in the sea 
1	o throat o throbbing heart 
1	and i singing uselessly uselessly all the night 
1	o past o happy life o songs of joy 
1	in the air in the woods over fields 
1	loved loved loved loved loved 
1	but my mate no more no more with me 
1	we two together no more 
1	the aria sinking 
1	all else continuing the stars shining 
1	the winds blowing the notes of the bird continuous echoing 
1	with angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning 
1	on the sands of paumanok s shore gray and rustling 
1	the boy ecstatic with his bare feet the waves with his hair the
1	the aria s meaning the ears the soul swiftly depositing 
1	the strange tears down the cheeks coursing 
1	the colloquy there the trio each uttering 
1	the undertone the savage old mother incessantly crying 
1	demon or bird said the boy s soul 
1	is it indeed toward your mate you sing or is it really to me 
1	and already a thousand singers a thousand songs clearer louder
1	o you singer solitary singing by yourself projecting me 
1	never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me 
1	never again leave me to be the peaceful child i was before what
1	there in the night 
1	by the sea under the yellow and sagging moon 
1	the messenger there arous d the fire the sweet hell within 
1	the unknown want the destiny of me 
1	o give me the clue it lurks in the night here somewhere 
1	o if i am to have so much let me have more 
1	a word then for i will conquer it 
1	the word final superior to all 
1	subtle sent up what is it i listen 
1	are you whispering it and have been all the time you sea waves 
1	whereto answering the sea 
1	delaying not hurrying not 
1	whisper d me through the night and very plainly before daybreak 
1	and again death death death death
1	which i do not forget 
1	but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother 
1	that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanok s gray beach 
1	with the thousand responsive songs at random 
1	my own songs awaked from that hour 
1	and with them the key the word up from the waves 
1	the word of the sweetest song and all songs 
1	that strong and delicious word which creeping to my feet 
1	 or like some old crone rocking the cradle swathed in sweet
1	garments bending aside 
1	the sea whisper d me 
1	as i ebb d with the ocean of life
1	as i ebb d with the ocean of life 
1	as i wended the shores i know 
1	as i walk d where the ripples continually wash you paumanok 
1	where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant 
1	where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways 
1	i musing late in the autumn day gazing off southward 
1	chaff straw splinters of wood weeds and the sea gluten 
1	as i wended the shores i know 
1	as i walk d with that electric self seeking types 
1	as i wend to the shores i know not 
1	as i list to the dirge the voices of men and women wreck d 
1	as i inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me 
1	as the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer 
1	i too but signify at the utmost a little wash d up drift 
1	a few sands and dead leaves to gather 
1	gather and merge myself as part of the sands and drift 
1	o baffled balk d bent to the very earth 
1	oppress d with myself that i have dared to open my mouth 
1	but that before all my arrogant poems the real me stands yet
1	untouch d untold altogether unreach d 
1	i perceive i have not really understood any thing not a single
1	object and that no man ever can 
1	because i have dared to open my mouth to sing at all 
1	you oceans both i close with you 
1	you friable shore with trails of debris 
1	you fish shaped island i take what is underfoot 
1	what is yours is mine my father 
1	i too have bubbled up floated the measureless float and been
1	wash d on your shores 
1	i too am but a trail of drift and debris 
1	i too leave little wrecks upon you you fish shaped island

1	aboard at a ship s helm 
1	a young steersman steering with care 
1	through fog on a sea coast dolefully ringing 
1	an ocean bell o a warning bell rock d by the waves 
1	o you give good notice indeed you bell by the sea reefs ringing 
1	for as on the alert o steersman you mind the loud admonition 
1	away gayly and safe 
1	but o the ship the immortal ship o ship aboard the ship 
1	ship of the body ship of the soul voyaging voyaging voyaging 
1	on the beach at night 
1	stands a child with her father 
1	watching the east the autumn sky 
1	up through the darkness 
1	amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east 
1	ascends large and calm the lord star jupiter 
1	and nigh at hand only a very little above 
1	swim the delicate sisters the pleiades 
1	from the beach the child holding the hand of her father 
1	those burial clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all 
1	watching silently weeps 
1	weep not child 
1	weep not my darling 
1	with these kisses let me remove your tears 
1	the ravening clouds shall not long be victorious 
1	jupiter shall emerge be patient watch again another night the

1	they are immortal all those stars both silvery and golden shall
1	shine out again

1	then dearest child mournest thou only for jupiter 
1	considerest thou alone the burial of the stars 
1	something there is 
1	 with my lips soothing thee adding i whisper 
1	i give thee the first suggestion the problem and indirection 
1	something there is more immortal even than the stars 
1	 many the burials many the days and nights passing away 
1	something that shall endure longer even than lustrous jupiter
1	longer than sun or any revolving satellite 
1	or the radiant sisters the pleiades 
1	the world below the brine
1	the world below the brine 
1	forests at the bottom of the sea the branches and leaves

1	sluggish existences grazing there suspended or slowly crawling
1	close to the bottom 
1	the leaden eyed shark the walrus the turtle the hairy
1	sea leopard and the sting ray 
1	on the beach at night alone 
1	as the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song 
1	a vast similitude interlocks all

1	all distances of place however wide 
1	all distances of time all inanimate forms 
1	this vast similitude spans them and always has spann d 
1	and shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them 
1	to day a rude brief recitative 
1	far as the eye can reach 
1	of dashing spray and the winds piping and blowing 
1	and out of these a chant for the sailors of all nations 
1	fitful like a surge 
1	pick d sparingly without noise by thee old ocean chosen by thee

1	steady the roar of the gale with incessant undertone muttering 
1	shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing 
1	waves air midnight their savagest trinity lashing 
1	out in the shadows there milk white combs careering 
1	on beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting 
1	where through the murk the easterly death wind breasting 
1	through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing 
1	steadily slowly through hoarse roar never remitting 
1	along the midnight edge by those milk white combs careering 
1	a group of dim weird forms struggling the night confronting 
1	that savage trinity warily watching 
1	after the sea ship after the whistling winds 
1	after the white gray sails taut to their spars and ropes 
1	below a myriad myriad waves hastening lifting up their necks 
1	tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship 
1	waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling blithely prying 
1	waves undulating waves liquid uneven emulous waves 
1	toward that whirling current laughing and buoyant with curves 
1	where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface 
1	a motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments

1	and then the song of each member of these states 
1	o a new song a free song 
1	on the ground where father and child stand 
1	in the upward air where their eyes turn 
1	where the banner at daybreak is flapping 
1	words book words what are you 
1	words no more for hearken and see 
1	my song is there in the open air and i must sing

1	come up here bard bard 
1	come up here soul soul 
1	come up here dear little child 
1	father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger 
1	and what does it say to me all the while 
1	nothing my babe you see in the sky 
1	and nothing at all to you it says but look you my babe 
1	how envied by all the earth 
1	fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high 
1	on floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels 
1	floating so buoyant with milk white foam on the waters 
1	but i am not the sea nor the red sun 
1	i am not the wind with girlish laughter 
1	which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land 
1	which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings 
1	o father it is alive it is full of people it has children 
1	o now it seems to me it is talking to its children 
1	i hear it it talks to me o it is wonderful 
1	o it stretches it spreads and runs so fast o my father 
1	it is so broad it covers the whole sky 
1	cease cease my foolish babe 
1	what you are saying is sorrowful to me much t displeases me 
1	speak to the child o bard out of manhattan 
1	to our children all or north or south of manhattan 
1	for what are we mere strips of cloth profiting nothing 
1	only flapping in the wind 
1	i hear and see not strips of cloth alone 
1	i hear the tramp of armies i hear the challenging sentry 
1	i hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men i hear liberty 
1	i hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing 
1	i myself move abroad swift rising flying then 
1	see the identity formed out of thirty eight spacious and haughty
1	states and many more to come 
1	see forts on the shores of harbors see ships sailing in and out 
1	runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance and now the halyards
1	side of my banner broad and blue side of my starry banner 
1	discarding peace over all the sea and land 
1	yet louder higher stronger bard yet farther wider cleave 
1	no longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone 
1	we may be terror and carnage and are so now 
1	not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty states nor
1	nor market nor depot we nor money bank in the city 
1	miles the capitals 
1	the forty millions of people o bard in life and death supreme 
1	o my father i like not the houses 
1	they will never to me be any thing nor do i like money 
1	child of mine you fill me with anguish 
1	to be that pennant would be too fearful 
1	little you know what it is this day and after this day forever 
1	with passions of demons slaughter premature death 
1	demons and death then i sing 
1	put in all aye all will i sword shaped pennant for war 
1	and the beach waves combing over the beach on my eastern shore 
1	and my western shore the same 
1	no more with tender lip nor musical labial sound 
1	my limbs my veins dilate my theme is clear at last 
1	not houses of peace indeed are you nor any nor all their
1	prosperity if need be you shall again have every one of those
1	houses to destroy them 
1	you thought not to destroy those valuable houses standing fast 
1	full of comfort built with money 
1	nor excellent stores nor landed on wharves from the ships 
1	not the superb ships with sail power or steam power fetching and
1	running up out of the night bringing your cluster of stars 
1	 ever enlarging stars 
1	divider of daybreak you cutting the air touch d by the sun 
1	measuring the sky 
1	 passionately seen and yearn d for by one poor little child 
1	while others remain busy or smartly talking forever teaching
1	thrift thrift 
1	owner of all o banner and pennant 
1	flapping up there in the wind 
1	rise o days from your fathomless deeps
1	i watch d with joy the threatening maws of the waves 
1	saw from below what arose and mounted o superb o wild as my
1	heart and powerful 
1	heard the continuous thunder as it bellow d after the lightning 
1	noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and
1	fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky 
1	all the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me 
1	yet there with my soul i fed i fed content supercilious 
1	 twas well o soul twas a good preparation you gave me 
1	now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill 
1	what to pavements and homesteads here what were those storms of
1	what to passions i witness around me to day was the sea risen 
1	was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds 
1	what was that swell i saw on the ocean behold what comes here 
1	how it climbs with daring feet and hands how it dashes 
1	how the true thunder bellows after the lightning how bright the
1	flashes of lightning 
1	how democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on shown
1	through the dark by those flashes of lightning 
1	thunder on stride on democracy strike with vengeful stroke 
1	and do you rise higher than ever yet o days o cities 
1	crash heavier heavier yet o storms you have done me good 
1	certainties suitable to me 
1	hungering hungering hungering for primal energies and nature s
1	i refresh d myself with it only i could relish it only 
1	but now i no longer wait i am fully satisfied i am glutted 
1	the noble sire fallen on evil days 
1	i saw with hand uplifted menacing brandishing 
1	 memories of old in abeyance love and faith in abeyance 
1	the noble son on sinewy feet advancing 
1	drest in blue bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders 
1	then the mother of all with calm voice speaking 
1	when you yourself forever provide to defend me 
1	for you provided me washington and now these also 
1	city of ships 
1	 o the black ships o the fierce ships 
1	o the beautiful sharp bow d steam ships and sail ships 
1	city of the world for all races are here 
1	all the lands of the earth make contributions here 
1	city of the sea city of hurried and glittering tides 
1	behold me incarnate me as i have incarnated you 
1	in peace i chanted peace but now the drum of war is mine 
1	war red war is my song through your streets o city 
1	the centenarian s story
1	give me your hand old revolutionary 
1	the hill top is nigh but a few steps make room gentlemen 
1	up the path you have follow d me well spite of your hundred and
1	extra years 
1	you can walk old man though your eyes are almost done 
1	rest while i tell what the crowd around us means 
1	on the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising 
1	there is the camp one regiment departs to morrow 
1	do you hear the officers giving their orders 
1	do you hear the clank of the muskets 
1	why what comes over you now old man 
1	why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively 
1	the troops are but drilling they are yet surrounded with smiles 
1	while splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down 
1	green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze 
1	o er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between 
1	but drill and parade are over they march back to quarters 
1	only hear that approval of hands hear what a clapping 
1	as wending the crowds now part and disperse but we old man 
1	not for nothing have i brought you hither we must remain 
1	you to speak in your turn and i to listen and tell 
1	when i clutch d your hand it was not with terror 
1	but suddenly pouring about me here on every side 
1	over hills across lowlands and in the skirts of woods 
1	and along the shores in mire now fill d over came again and
1	suddenly raged 
1	walking then this hilltop this same ground 
1	aye this is the ground 
1	my blind eyes even as i speak behold it re peopled from graves 
1	the years recede pavements and stately houses disappear 
1	rude forts appear again the old hoop d guns are mounted 
1	i see the lines of rais d earth stretching from river to bay 
1	i mark the vista of waters i mark the uplands and slopes 
1	here we lay encamp d it was this time in summer also 
1	as i talk i remember all i remember the declaration 
1	it was read here the whole army paraded it was read to us here 
1	it glitter d in the sun in full sight of the army 
1	twas a bold act then the english war ships had just arrived 
1	we could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor 
1	and the transports swarming with soldiers 
1	a few days more and they landed and then the battle 
1	twenty thousand were brought against us 
1	a veteran force furnish d with good artillery 
1	i tell not now the whole of the battle 
1	of that brigade i tell and how steadily it march d 
1	and how long and well it stood confronting death 
1	the general watch d them from this hill 
1	they made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment 
1	it sickens me yet that slaughter 
1	i saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the general 
1	i saw how he wrung his hands in anguish 
1	we fought the fight in detachments 
1	till we turn d menacing here and then he left us 
1	few return d nearly all remain in brooklyn 
1	that and here my general s first battle 
1	no women looking on nor sunshine to bask in it did not conclude
1	with applause 
1	nobody clapp d hands here then 
1	but in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain 
1	wearied that night we lay foil d and sullen 
1	so dull and damp and another day 
1	but the night of that mist lifting rain ceasing 
1	silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him my
1	general retreated 
1	i saw him at the river side 
1	down by the ferry lit by torches hastening the embarcation 
1	every one else seem d fill d with gloom 
1	many no doubt thought of capitulation 
1	but when my general pass d me 
1	as he stood in his boat and look d toward the coming sun 
1	i saw something different from capitulation 
1	enough the centenarian s story ends 
1	the two the past and present have interchanged 
1	and is this the ground washington trod 
1	i must copy the story and send it eastward and westward 
1	i must preserve that look as it beam d on you rivers of brooklyn 
1	see as the annual round returns the phantoms return 
1	it is the th of august and the british have landed 
1	the battle begins and goes against us behold through the smoke
1	washington s face 
1	baptized that day in many a young man s bloody wounds 
1	in death defeat and sisters mothers tears 
1	in the midst of you stands an encampment very old 
1	stands forever the camp of that dead brigade 
1	a line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands 
1	the guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind 
1	i see before me now a traveling army halting 
1	breaking out the eternal stars 
1	with its cloud of skirmishers in advance 
1	the swarming ranks press on and on the dense brigades press on 
1	glittering dimly toiling under the sun the dust cover d men 
1	in columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground 
1	with artillery interspers d the wheels rumble the horses sweat 
1	by the bivouac s fitful flame
1	by the bivouac s fitful flame 
1	a procession winding around me solemn and sweet and slow but
1	first i note 
1	like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving 
1	a solemn and slow procession there as i sit on the ground 
1	by the bivouac s fitful flame 
1	come up from the fields father

1	a march in the ranks hard prest and the road unknown 
1	a route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness 
1	clouds of smoke 
1	at my feet more distinctly a soldier a mere lad in danger of
1	bleeding to death he is shot in the abdomen 
1	the unknown road still marching

1	but in silence in dreams projections 
1	while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on 
1	bearing the bandages water and sponge

1	for the son is brought with the father 
1	 in the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell 
1	two veterans son and father dropt together 
1	and the double grave awaits them 
1	now nearer blow the bugles

1	sings by himself a song 
1	song of the bleeding throat 
1	death s outlet song of life for well dear brother i know 
1	if thou wast not granted to sing thou wouldst surely die

1	the star my departing comrade holds and detains me 
1	o how shall i warble myself for the dead one there i loved 
1	sea winds blown from east and west 
1	blown from the eastern sea and blown from the western sea till
1	there on the prairies meeting

1	loud human song with voice of uttermost woe 
1	o liquid and free and tender 
1	o wild and loose to my soul o wondrous singer 
1	you only i hear yet the star holds me but will soon depart 
1	yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me 
1	now while i sat in the day and look d forth 
1	the many moving sea tides and i saw the ships how they sail d 
1	and the summer approaching with richness and the fields all busy
1	and the infinite separate houses how they all went on each with
1	and i knew death its thought and the sacred knowledge of death 
1	then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me 
1	and the thought of death close walking the other side of me 
1	i fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not 
1	and the singer so shy to the rest receiv d me 
1	the gray brown bird i know receiv d us comrades three 
1	and he sang the carol of death and a verse for him i love 
1	from deep secluded recesses 
1	from the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still 
1	came the carol of the bird 
1	and the charm of the carol rapt me 
1	as i held as if by their hands my comrades in the night

1	these states are the amplest poem 
1	here is not merely a nation but a teeming nation of nations 
1	here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of particulars 
1	land of lands and bards to corroborate 
1	built of the common stock having room for far and near 
1	used to dispense with other lands incarnating this land 
1	attracting it body and soul to himself hanging on its neck with

1	stretching with them north or south

1	with war s flames and the lambent lightnings playing 
1	and your port immovable where you stand 
1	the menacing arrogant one that strode and advanced with his
1	senseless scorn bearing the murderous knife 
1	an offal rank to the dunghill maggots spurn d 
1	o well beloved stone cutters i lead them who plan with decision
1	and science 
1	lead the present with friendly hand toward the future 
1	 bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age 
1	but damn that which spends itself with no thought of the stain

1	 soul of love and tongue of fire

1	of these states the poet is the equable man 
1	nothing out of its place is good nothing in its place is bad 
1	he bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion neither
1	he is the arbiter of the diverse he is the key 
1	he is the equalizer of his age and land

1	helpless thing 
1	as he sees the farthest he has the most faith 
1	his thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things 
1	in the dispute on god and eternity he is silent 
1	he sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement 
1	as dreams or dots 
1	for the great idea the idea of perfect and free individuals 
1	for that the bard walks in advance leader of leaders 
1	without extinction is liberty without retrograde is equality 
1	they live in the feelings of young men and the best women 
1	for the great idea

1	the liliput countless armies of the grass

1	fecund america today 
1	thou art all over set in births and joys

1	thou lucky mistress of the tranquil barns 
1	thou prairie dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon
1	dispensatress that by a word givest a thousand miles a million
1	farms and missest nothing 
1	when late i sang sad was my voice 
1	sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and
1	smoke of war 
1	in the midst of the conflict the heroes i stood 
1	or pass d with slow step through the wounded and dying 
1	but now i sing not war 
1	nor the measur d march of soldiers nor the tents of camps 
1	nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle 
1	no more the sad unnatural shows of war 
1	 pass pass ye proud brigades with your tramping sinewy legs 
1	pass then rattle drums again 
1	for an army heaves in sight o another gathering army 
1	swarming trailing on the rear o you dread accruing army 
1	lo your pallid army follows 
1	but on these days of brightness 
1	should the dead intrude 
1	ah the dead to me mar not they fit well in nature 
1	they fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass 
1	and along the edge of the sky in the horizon s far margin 
1	nor do i forget you departed 
1	nor in winter or summer my lost ones 
1	your memories rising glide silently by me 
1	i saw the day the return of the heroes 
1	 yet the heroes never surpass d shall never return 
1	them that day i saw not 
1	i saw the interminable corps i saw the processions of armies 
1	i saw them approaching defiling by with divisions 
1	no holiday soldiers youthful yet veterans 
1	inured on many a hard fought bloody field 
1	a pause the armies wait 
1	a million flush d embattled conquerors wait 
1	exult o lands victorious lands 
1	not there your victory on those red shuddering fields 
1	but here and hence your victory 
1	melt melt away ye armies disperse ye blue clad soldiers 
1	resolve ye back again give up for good your deadly arms 
1	other the arms the fields henceforth for you or south or north 
1	with saner wars sweet wars life giving wars 
1	loud o my throat and clear o soul 
1	the season of thanks and the voice of full yielding 
1	the chant of joy and power for boundless fertility 
1	all till d and untill d fields expand before me 
1	i see the true arenas of my race or first or last 
1	man s innocent and strong arenas 
1	i see the heroes at other toils 
1	i see well wielded in their hands the better weapons 
1	i see where the mother of all 
1	with full spanning eye gazes forth dwells long 
1	and counts the varied gathering of the products 
1	busy the far the sunlit panorama 
1	prairie orchard and yellow grain of the north 
1	cotton and rice of the south and louisianian cane 
1	open unseeded fallows rich fields of clover and timothy 
1	kine and horses feeding and droves of sheep and swine 
1	and many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook 
1	and healthy uplands with herby perfumed breezes

1	not alone on those warlike fields the mother of all 
1	with dilated form and lambent eyes watch d you

1	the mother of all yet here as ever she watches you 
1	well pleased america thou beholdest 
1	over the fields of the west those crawling monsters 
1	the human divine inventions the labor saving implements 
1	beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the
1	revolving hay rakes 
1	the steam power reaping machines and the horse power machines
1	the engines thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain well
1	separating the straw the nimble work of the patent pitchfork 
1	beholdest the newer saw mill the southern cotton gin and the
1	rice cleanser 
1	beneath thy look o maternal 
1	all gather and all harvest 
1	gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns 
1	golden the sweet potato of georgia and the carolinas 
1	clip the wool of california or pennsylvania 
1	or aught that ripens in all these states or north or south 
1	under the beaming sun and under thee 
1	there was a child went forth every day 
1	and the first object he look d upon that object he became 
1	the early lilacs became part of this child 
1	and grass and white and red morning glories and white and red
1	clover and the song of the phoebe bird 
1	esculent roots of the garden 
1	and the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the
1	tavern whence he had lately risen 
1	and the schoolmistress that pass d on her way to the school 
1	and the friendly boys that pass d and the quarrelsome boys 
1	they gave this child more of themselves than that 
1	they gave him afterward every day they became part of him 
1	odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by 
1	yearning and swelling heart 
1	the doubts of day time and the doubts of night time the curious
1	whether and how 
1	the ferries 
1	the schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide the little
1	boat slack tow d astern 
1	the hurrying tumbling waves quick broken crests slapping 
1	the strata of color d clouds the long bar of maroon tint away
1	solitary by itself the spread of purity it lies motionless in 
1	these became part of that child who went forth every day and who
1	far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty 
1	crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother 
1	once a queen now lean and tatter d seated on the ground 
1	her old white hair drooping dishevel d round her shoulders 
1	at her feet fallen an unused royal harp 
1	yet a word ancient mother

1	something startles me where i thought i was safest

1	where have you disposed of their carcasses 
1	those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations 
1	where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat 
1	i do not see any of it upon you to day or perhaps i am deceiv d 
1	i am sure i shall expose some of the foul meat

1	the delicate spear of the onion pierces upward

1	what chemistry 
1	that the winds are really not infectious 
1	themselves in it 
1	that all is clean forever and forever 
1	that the cool drink from the well tastes so good 
1	that blackberries are so flavorous and juicy 
1	that the fruits of the apple orchard and the orange orchard that
1	that when i recline on the grass i do not catch any disease 
1	though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once
1	catching disease 
1	now i am terrified at the earth it is that calm and patient 
1	it grows such sweet things out of such corruptions 
1	it turns harmless and stainless on its axis with such endless

1	 not songs of loyalty alone are these 
1	but songs of insurrection also

1	leadballs do their work

1	infidel enter d into full possession 
1	it waits for all the rest to go it is the last 
1	when there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs 
1	then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from

1	then courage european revolter revoltress

1	what laws customs wealth arts traditions 
1	not a mark not a record remains and yet all remains 
1	o i know that those men and women were not for nothing any more
1	than we are for nothing 
1	afar they stand yet near to me they stand 
1	some with oval countenances learn d and calm 
1	some naked and savage some like huge collections of insects 
1	some in tents herdsmen patriarchs tribes horsemen 
1	some prowling through woods some living peaceably on farms 
1	laboring reaping filling barns

1	are those billions of men really gone 
1	are those women of the old experience of the earth gone 
1	do their lives cities arts rest only with us 
1	did they achieve nothing for good for themselves 
1	i believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of
1	them any more than this shall be the end of my nation or of me 
1	games wars manners crimes prisons slaves heroes poets

1	turning from all the samples monuments of heroes 
1	while through the interior vistas

1	in one the sacred parturition scene 
1	a happy painless mother birth d a perfect child

1	hundreds concentring walk d the paths and streets and roads 
1	toward a tall domed school 
1	in one a trio beautiful 
1	grandmother loving daughter loving daughter s daughter sat

1	reading conversing 
1	all all the shows of laboring life 
1	city and country women s men s and children s 
1	 the intentions perfect and divine 
1	the workings details haply human 
1	o thou within this tomb

1	out from behind this mask to confront a portrait 
1	out from behind this bending rough cut mask 
1	these lights and shades this drama of the whole 
1	 tragedies sorrows laughter tears heaven 
1	the passionate teeming plays this curtain hid 
1	this glaze of god s serenest purest sky 
1	this film of satan s seething pit 
1	out from the convolutions of this globe 
1	here the idea all in this mystic handful wrapt 
1	these burin d eyes flashing to you to pass to future time 
1	a traveler of thoughts and years of peace and war 
1	of youth long sped and middle age declining 
1	lingering a moment here and now to you i opposite turn 
1	to draw and clinch your soul for once inseparably with mine 
1	then travel travel on 
1	vocalism measure concentration determination and the divine
1	power to speak words 
1	do you move in these broad lands as broad as they 
1	come duly to the divine power to speak words 
1	for only at last after many years after chastity friendship 
1	procreation prudence and nakedness 
1	after treading ground and breasting river and lake 
1	after complete faith after clarifyings elevations and removing
1	after these and more it is just possible there comes to a man 
1	woman the divine power to speak words 
1	then toward that man or that woman swiftly hasten all none
1	refuse all attend 
1	close ranks 
1	they debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through the
1	mouth of that man or that woman 
1	o what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices 
1	all waits for the right voices 
1	i see brains and lips closed tympans and temples unstruck 
1	until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose 
1	until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies
1	slumbering forever ready in all words 
1	my spirit to yours dear brother 
1	i specify you with joy o my comrade to salute you and to salute
1	those who are with you before and since and those to come also 
1	we walk silent among disputes and assertions but reject not the
1	disputers nor any thing that is asserted 
1	we hear the bawling and din we are reach d at by divisions 
1	jealousies recriminations on every side 
1	they close peremptorily upon us to surround us my comrade 
1	yet we walk unheld free the whole earth over journeying up and
1	ages to come may prove brethren and lovers as we are 
1	you felons on trial in courts 
1	you convicts in prison cells you sentenced assassins chain d and
1	who am i too that i am not on trial or in prison 
1	o culpable i acknowledge i expose 
1	 o admirers praise not me compliment not me you make me wince 
1	inside these breast bones i lie smutch d and choked 
1	i walk with delinquents with passionate love 
1	laws for creations 
1	for strong artists and leaders for fresh broods of teachers and
1	perfect literats for america 
1	for noble savans and coming musicians 
1	all must have reference to the ensemble of the world and the
1	compact truth of the world 
1	what do you suppose creation is 
1	and that there is no god any more divine than yourself 
1	and that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean 
1	be composed be at ease with me i am walt whitman liberal and
1	lusty as nature 
1	not till the sun excludes you do i exclude you 
1	not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to
1	rustle for you do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you 
1	and i charge you that you be patient and perfect till i come 
1	i was looking a long while for intentions 
1	for a clew to the history of the past for myself and for these
1	chants and now i have found it 
1	it is not in those paged fables in the libraries them i neither
1	it is no more in the legends than in all else 
1	it is in the present it is this earth to day 
1	it is in democracy the purport and aim of all the past 
1	it is in the broad show of artificial things ships machinery 
1	of persons arrived at high positions ceremonies wealth 
1	scholarships and the like 
1	so that often to me they appear gaunt and naked 
1	and often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true
1	realities of life and go toward false realities 
1	and often to me they are alive after what custom has served them 
1	why who makes much of a miracle 
1	as to me i know of nothing else but miracles 
1	whether i walk the streets of manhattan 
1	or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky 
1	or talk by day with any one i love or sleep in the bed at night
1	with any one i love 
1	or sit at table at dinner with the rest 
1	or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car 
1	or watch honey bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon 
1	or animals feeding in the fields 
1	or birds or the wonderfulness of insects in the air 
1	or the wonderfulness of the sundown or of stars shining so quiet
1	or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring 
1	these with the rest one and all are to me miracles 
1	the whole referring yet each distinct and in its place 
1	to me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle 
1	every cubic inch of space is a miracle 
1	to me the sea is a continual miracle 
1	the fishes that swim the rocks the motion of the waves the
1	ships with men in them 
1	what stranger miracles are there 
1	sparkles from the wheel
1	where the city s ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day 
1	by the curb toward the edge of the flagging 
1	a knife grinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife 
1	forth issue then in copious golden jets 
1	sparkles from the wheel 
1	the scene and all its belongings how they seize and affect me 
1	the sad sharp chinn d old man with worn clothes and broad
1	shoulder band of leather 
1	myself effusing and fluid a phantom curiously floating now here
1	the group an unminded point set in a vast surrounding 
1	sparkles from the wheel 
1	is reform needed is it through you 
1	you do you not see how it would serve to have eyes blood 
1	complexion clean and sweet 
1	o the magnet the flesh over and over 
1	elevatedness 
1	unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded and is
1	form d of perfect body 
1	unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come the
1	poems of man only thence have my poems come 
1	unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman i love only thence
1	unfolded by brawny embraces from the well muscled woman
1	love only thence come the brawny embraces of the man 
1	unfolded out of the folds of the woman s brain come all the folds
1	unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded 
1	a man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity but
1	every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman 
1	what am i after all but a child pleas d with the sound of my own
1	i stand apart to hear it never tires me 
1	to you your name also 
1	who includes diversity and is nature 
1	or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing

1	who constructing the house of himself or herself not for a day
1	but for all time sees races eras dates generations

1	i am of the same style for i am their friend 
1	i love them quits and quits i do not halt and make salaams 
1	they are so beautiful i nudge myself to listen 
1	it is no small matter this round and delicious globe moving so
1	exactly in its orbit for ever and ever without one jolt or
1	the untruth of a single second 
1	i do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman 
1	nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman 
1	and pass d from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of
1	summers and winters to articulate and walk all this is
1	equally wonderful 
1	and that my soul embraces you this hour and we affect each other
1	each other is every bit as wonderful 
1	and that i can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful 
1	be true is just as wonderful 
1	and that the moon spins round the earth and on with the earth is

1	around me i hear that eclat of the world politics produce 
1	the announcements of recognized things science 
1	the approved growth of cities and the spread of inventions 
1	i see the ships they will last a few years 
1	the vast factories with their foremen and workmen 
1	and hear the indorsement of all and do not object to it 
1	but i too announce solid things 
1	science ships politics cities factories are not nothing 
1	like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring 
1	triumphantly moving and grander heaving in sight 
1	they stand for realities all is as it should be

1	enough o soul 
1	o soul we have positively appear d that is enough 
1	years of the modern years of the unperform d 
1	your horizon rises i see it parting away for more august dramas 
1	i see freedom completely arm d and victorious and very haughty 
1	with law on one side and peace on the other 
1	a stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste 
1	what historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach 
1	i see men marching and countermarching by swift millions 
1	never was average man his soul more energetic more like a god 
1	his daring foot is on land and sea everywhere he colonizes the
1	pacific the archipelagoes 
1	with the steamship the electric telegraph the newspaper the

1	with these and the world spreading factories he interlinks all
1	geography all lands 
1	pierce it is full of phantoms 
1	unborn deeds things soon to be project their shapes around me 
1	your dreams o years how they penetrate through me i know not
1	whether i sleep or wake 
1	ashes of soldiers south or north 
1	as i muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought 
1	the war resumes again to my sense your shapes 
1	and again the advance of the armies 
1	noiseless as mists and vapors 
1	from their graves in the trenches ascending 
1	from cemeteries all through virginia and tennessee 
1	from every point of the compass out of the countless graves 
1	and silently gather round me 
1	now sound no note o trumpeters 
1	not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses 
1	my handsome tan faced horsemen what life what joy and pride 
1	with all the perils were yours 
1	nor you drummers neither at reveille at dawn 
1	faces so pale with wondrous eyes very dear gather closer yet 
1	draw close but speak not 
1	phantoms of countless lost 
1	invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions 
1	follow me ever desert me not while i live 
1	but sweet ah sweet are the dead with their silent eyes 
1	dearest comrades all is over and long gone 
1	but love is not over and what love o comrades 
1	perfume from battle fields rising up from the foetor arising 
1	perfume therefore my chant o love immortal love 
1	give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers 
1	shroud them embalm them cover them all over with tender pride 
1	perfume all make all wholesome 
1	make these ashes to nourish and blossom 
1	o love solve all fructify all with the last chemistry 
1	give me exhaustless make me a fountain 
1	of these years i sing 
1	how they pass and have pass d through convuls d pains as through
1	evil as well as good 
1	the vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one s self 
1	how the whirl the contest the wrestle of evil with good the
1	sounding and resounding keep on and on 
1	how america is the continent of glories and of the triumph of
1	freedom and of the democracies and of the fruits of society and
1	and how these of mine and of the states will in their turn be
1	convuls d and serve other parturitions and transitions 
1	serves 
1	of seeds dropping into the ground of births 
1	of the steady concentration of america inland upward to
1	impregnable and swarming places 
1	of what indiana kentucky arkansas and the rest are to be 
1	 or afar mounting the northern pacific to sitka or aliaska 
1	of this union welded in blood of the solemn price paid of the
1	unnamed lost ever present in my mind 
1	of the temporary use of materials for identity s sake 
1	of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey d and unsuspected 
1	of the new and good names of the modern developments of
1	inalienable homesteads 
1	of a free and original life there of simple diet and clean and
1	sweet blood 
1	splendor of ended day floating and filling me 
1	hour prophetic hour resuming the past 
1	inflating my throat you divine average 
1	you earth and life till the last ray gleams i sing 
1	open mouth of my soul uttering gladness 
1	eyes of my soul seeing perfection

1	corroborating forever the triumph of things 
1	illustrious every one 
1	illustrious what we name space sphere of unnumber d spirits 
1	illustrious the passing light illustrious the pale reflection on
1	illustrious whatever i see or hear or touch to the last 
1	good in all 
1	in the satisfaction and aplomb of animals 
1	in the annual return of the seasons 
1	in the hilarity of youth 
1	in the strength and flush of manhood 
1	in the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age 
1	in the superb vistas of death 
1	wonderful to depart 
1	wonderful to be here 
1	the heart to jet the all alike and innocent blood 
1	to breathe the air how delicious 
1	to speak to walk to seize something by the hand 
1	to prepare for sleep for bed to look on my rose color d flesh 
1	to be conscious of my body so satisfied so large 
1	to be this incredible god i am 
1	to have gone forth among other gods these men and women i love 
1	wonderful how i celebrate you and myself
1	how my thoughts play subtly at the spectacles around 
1	how the clouds pass silently overhead 
1	o amazement of things even the least particle 
1	o spirituality of things 
1	i take your strong chords intersperse them and cheerfully pass
1	them forward 
1	i too carol the sun usher d or at noon or as now setting 
1	i too throb to the brain and beauty of the earth and of all the
1	growths of the earth 
1	i too have felt the resistless call of myself 
1	as i steam d down the mississippi 
1	as i wander d over the prairies 
1	as i have lived as i have look d through my windows my eyes 
1	i sing to the last the equalities modern or old 
1	i sing the endless finales of things 
1	i say nature continues glory continues

1	withdraw 
1	to follow to seek to be with her dear dead son

1	over each the blanket spread ample brownish woollen blanket 
1	gray and heavy blanket folding covering all 
1	curious i halt and silent stand 
1	then with light fingers i from the face of the nearest the first
1	just lift the blanket 
1	who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim with well gray d hair 
1	who are you my dear comrade 
1	then to the second i step and who are you my child and darling

1	dead and divine and brother of all and here again he lies 
1	year that trembled and reel d beneath me

1	o a new song a free song 
1	by the banner s voice and the child s voice and sea s voice and
1	father s voice 
1	low on the ground and high in the air 
1	on the ground where father and child stand 
1	in the upward air where their eyes turn 
1	where the banner at daybreak is flapping 
1	words book words what are you 
1	words no more for hearken and see 
1	my song is there in the open air and i must sing 
1	with the banner and pennant a flapping 
1	i ll weave the chord and twine in 
1	then loosen launch forth to go and compete 
1	with the banner and pennant a flapping 
1	come up here bard bard 
1	come up here soul soul 
1	come up here dear little child 
1	father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger 
1	and what does it say to me all the while 
1	nothing my babe you see in the sky 
1	and nothing at all to you it says but look you my babe 
1	look at these dazzling things in the houses and see you the
1	money shops opening 
1	these ah these how valued and toil d for these 
1	how envied by all the earth 
1	fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high 
1	on floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels 
1	floating so buoyant with milk white foam on the waters 
1	but i am not the sea nor the red sun 
1	i am not the wind with girlish laughter 
1	which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land 
1	which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings 
1	aloft there flapping and flapping 
1	o father it is alive it is full of people it has children 
1	o now it seems to me it is talking to its children 
1	i hear it it talks to me o it is wonderful 
1	o it stretches it spreads and runs so fast o my father 
1	it is so broad it covers the whole sky 
1	cease cease my foolish babe 
1	what you are saying is sorrowful to me much it displeases me 
1	behold with the rest again i say behold not banners and pennants
1	but the well prepared pavements behold and mark the solid wall d
1	speak to the child o bard out of manhattan 
1	to our children all or north or south of manhattan 
1	point this day leaving all the rest to us over all and yet we
1	know not why 
1	for what are we mere strips of cloth profiting nothing 
1	only flapping in the wind 
1	i hear and see not strips of cloth alone 
1	i hear the tramp of armies i hear the challenging sentry 
1	i hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men i hear liberty 
1	i hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing 
1	i myself move abroad swift rising flying then 
1	i see the stores depots of boston baltimore charleston new
1	i see far in the west the immense area of grain i dwell awhile
1	hovering 
1	side of my banner broad and blue side of my starry banner 
1	discarding peace over all the sea and land 
1	yet louder higher stronger bard yet farther wider cleave 
1	no longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone 
1	we may be terror and carnage and are so now 
1	nor market nor depot we nor money bank in the city 
1	over the area spread below the three or four millions of square
1	miles the capitals 
1	the forty millions of people o bard in life and death supreme 
1	we even we henceforth flaunt out masterful high up above 
1	o my father i like not the houses 
1	they will never to me be anything nor do i like money 
1	child of mine you fill me with anguish 
1	to be that pennant would be too fearful 
1	little you know what it is this day and after this day forever 
1	with passions of demons slaughter premature death 
1	demons and death then i sing 
1	put in all aye all will i sword shaped pennant for war 
1	and the black ships fighting on the sea envelop d in smoke 
1	and my illinois fields and my kansas fields and my fields of
1	fusing and holding claiming devouring the whole 
1	no more with tender lip nor musical labial sound 
1	my limbs my veins dilate my theme is clear at last 
1	i hear from above o pennant of war your ironical call and demand 
1	destroy them 
1	you thought not to destroy those valuable houses standing fast 
1	full of comfort built with money 
1	nor excellent stores nor landed on wharves from the ships 
1	not the superb ships with sail power or steam power fetching and
1	running up out of the night bringing your cluster of stars
1	 ever enlarging stars 
1	divider of daybreak you cutting the air touch d by the sun 
1	measuring the sky 
1	 passionately seen and yearn d for by one poor little child 
1	valueless object of eyes over all and demanding all absolute
1	owner of all o banner and pennant 
1	i too leave the rest great as it is it is nothing houses 
1	machines are nothing i see them not 
1	flapping up there in the wind 
1	 a long island incident early part of the nineteenth century 
1	amid these days of order ease prosperity 
1	amid the current songs of beauty peace decorum 
1	i cast a reminiscence likely t will offend you 
1	i heard it in my boyhood more than a generation since 
1	a queer old savage man a fighter under washington himself
1	revolutionary war 
1	lay dying sons daughters church deacons lovingly tending him 
1	 let me return again to my war days 
1	to the sights and scenes to forming the line of battle 
1	to the scouts ahead reconnoitering 
1	to the cannons the grim artillery 
1	to the galloping aids carrying orders 
1	to the wounded the fallen the heat the suspense 
1	the perfume strong the smoke the deafening noise 
1	away with your life of peace your joys of peace 
1	give me my old wild battle life again 
1	an old man bending i come among new faces 
1	years looking backward resuming in answer to children 
1	come tell us old man as from young men and maidens that love me
1	now be witness again paint the mightiest armies of earth 
1	of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us 
1	what stays with you latest and deepest of curious panics 
1	o maidens and young men i love and that love me 
1	soldiers joys
1	but in silence in dreams projections 
1	while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on 
1	bearing the bandages water and sponge 
1	straight and swift to my wounded i go 
1	where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in 
1	where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground 
1	to each and all one after another i draw near not one do i miss 
1	i onward go i stop 
1	with hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds 
1	i am firm with each the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable 
1	one turns to me his appealing eyes poor boy i never knew you 
1	on on i go open doors of time open hospital doors 
1	 come sweet death be persuaded o beautiful death 
1	in mercy come quickly 
1	from the stump of the arm the amputated hand 
1	and has not yet look d on it 
1	i dress a wound in the side deep deep 
1	but a day or two more for see the frame all wasted and sinking 
1	and the yellow blue countenance see 
1	i dress the perforated shoulder the foot with the bullet wound 
1	i am faithful i do not give out 
1	the fractur d thigh the knee the wound in the abdomen 
1	thus in silence in dreams projections 
1	returning resuming i thread my way through the hospitals 
1	the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand 
1	i sit by the restless all the dark night some are so young 
1	some suffer so much i recall the experience sweet and sad
1	the last sunbeam
1	lightly falls from the finish d sabbath 
1	on the pavement here and there beyond it is looking
1	down a new made double grave
1	lo the moon ascending 
1	up from the east the silvery round moon 
1	beautiful over the house tops ghastly phantom moon 
1	immense and silent moon 
1	i see a sad procession 
1	and i hear the sound of coming full key d bugles 
1	all the channels of the city streets they re flooding 
1	as with voices and with tears 
1	i hear the great drums pounding 
1	and the small drums steady whirring 
1	and every blow of the great convulsive drums 
1	strikes me through and through 
1	for the son is brought with the father
1	 in the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell 
1	two veterans son and father dropt together 
1	and the double grave awaits them 
1	now nearer blow the bugles 
1	and the drums strike more convulsive 
1	and the daylight over the pavement quite has faded 
1	and the strong dead march enwraps me 
1	in the eastern sky up buoying 
1	the sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin d
1	 tis some mother s large transparent face 
1	in heaven brighter growing 
1	o strong dead march you please me 
1	o moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me 
1	o my soldiers twain o my veterans passing to burial 
1	what i have i also give you 
1	the moon gives you light 
1	and the bugles and the drums give you music 
1	and my heart o my soldiers my veterans

1	breaks forth a lightning flash 
1	thou of the tawny flowing hair in battle 
1	now ending well in death the splendid fever of thy deeds

1	song of the bleeding throat 
1	death s outlet song of life for well dear brother i know

1	yet the lilac with mastering odour holds me 
1	now while i sat in the day and look d forth 
1	under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing and the
1	the many moving sea tides and i saw the ships how they sail d 
1	and the infinite separate houses how they all went on each with
1	and i knew death its thought and the sacred knowledge of death 
1	then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me 
1	and the thought of death close walking the other side of me 
1	i fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not 
1	and the singer so shy to the rest receiv d me 
1	the gray brown bird i know receiv d us comrades three 
1	and he sang the carol of death and a verse for him i love 
1	from deep secluded recesses 
1	from the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still 
1	came the carol of the bird 
1	and the charm of the carol rapt me 
1	as i held as if by their hands my comrades in the night 
1	and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird

1	with pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night 
1	loud in the pines and cedars dim 
1	clear in the freshness moist and the swamp perfume 
1	and i with my comrades there in the night 
1	while my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed 
1	as to long panoramas of visions 
1	and i saw askant the armies 
1	i saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle flags 
1	i saw battle corpses myriads of them 
1	and the white skeletons of young men i saw them 
1	i saw the d bris and d bris of all the slain soldiers of the war 
1	they themselves were fully at rest they suffer d not

1	passing unloosing the hold of my comrades hands 
1	flooding the night 
1	sadly sinking and fainting as warning and warning and yet again
1	covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven 
1	as that powerful psalm in the night i heard from recesses 
1	passing i leave thee lilac with heart shaped leaves 
1	i cease from my song for thee

1	these states are the amplest poem

1	land of lands and bards to corroborate 
1	father s

1	the separate states the simple elastic scheme the immigrants

1	 bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age 
1	i listened to the phantom by ontario s shore 
1	i heard the voice arising demanding bards 
1	by them all native and grand by them alone can these states be
1	fused into the compact organism of a nation

1	ah mother prolific and full in all besides yet how long barren 
1	of these states the poet is the equable man 
1	nothing out of its place is good nothing in its place is bad 
1	he bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion neither
1	he is the arbiter of the diverse he is the key 
1	he is the equalizer of his age and land 
1	he supplies what wants supplying he checks what wants checking 
1	government 
1	in war he is the best backer of the war he fetches artillery as
1	good as the engineer s he can make every word he speaks draw
1	blood 
1	as he sees the farthest he has the most faith 
1	his thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things 
1	in the dispute on god and eternity he is silent 
1	he sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and d nouement 
1	for the great idea the idea of perfect and free individuals 
1	for that the bard walks in advance leader of leaders 
1	without extinction is liberty without retrograde is equality 
1	they live in the feelings of young men and the best women
1	for the great idea 
1	that o my brethren that is the mission of poets 
1	songs of stern defiance ever ready 
1	songs of the rapid arming and the march 
1	the flag of peace quick folded and instead the flag we know 
1	warlike flag of the great idea 
1	 angry cloth i saw there leaping 
1	i stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting 
1	i sing you over all flying beckoning through the fight o the
1	hard contested fight 
1	hark the ringing word charge now the tussle and the furious

0	is love so light sweet boy and may it be
0	that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee 
0	 is thine own heart to shine own face affected 
0	can thy right hand seize love upon thy left 
0	then woo thyself be of thyself rejected 
0	steal thine own freedom and complain on theft 
0	narcissus so himself himself forsook 
0	and died to kiss his shadow in the brook 
0	dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use 
0	herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear 
0	things growing to themselves are growth s abuse 
0	seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty

0	that thine may live when thou thyself art dead 
0	and so in spite of death thou dost survive 
0	in that thy likeness still is left alive 
0	by this the love sick queen began to sweat 
0	for where they lay the shadow had forsook them 
0	and titan tired in the mid day heat
0	with burning eye did hotly overlook them 
0	wishing adonis had his team to guide 
0	so he were like him and by venus side 
0	and now adonis with a lazy spright 
0	and with a heavy dark disliking eye 
0	his louring brows o erwhelming his fair sight 
0	like misty vapours when they blot the sky 
0	souring his cheeks cries fie no more of love 
0	the sun doth burn my face i must remove 
0	 ay me quoth venus young and so unkind 
0	what bare excuses mak st thou to be gone 
0	i ll sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind
0	shall cool the heat of this descending sun 
0	i ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs 
0	if they burn too i ll quench them with my tears 
0	 the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm 
0	and lo i lie between that sun and thee 
0	the heat i have from thence doth little harm 
0	thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me 
0	and were i not immortal life were done
0	between this heavenly and earthly sun 
0	 art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel 
0	nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth 
0	art thou a woman s son and canst not feel
0	what tis to love how want of love tormenteth 
0	o had thy mother borne so hard a mind 
0	she had not brought forth thee but died unkind 
0	 what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this 
0	or what great danger dwells upon my suit 
0	what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss 
0	speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute 
0	give me one kiss i ll give it thee again 
0	and one for interest if thou wilt have twain 
0	 fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone 
0	well painted idol image dull and dead 
0	statue contenting but the eye alone 
0	thing like a man but of no woman bred 
0	thou art no man though of a man s complexion 
0	for men will kiss even by their own direction 
0	this said impatience chokes her pleading tongue 
0	and swelling passion doth provoke a pause 
0	red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong 
0	being judge in love she cannot right her cause 
0	and now she weeps and now she fain would speak 
0	and now her sobs do her intendments break 
0	sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand 
0	now gazeth she on him now on the ground 
0	sometimes her arms infold him like a band 
0	she would he will not in her arms be bound 
0	and when from thence he struggles to be gone 
0	she locks her lily fingers one in one 
0	 fondling she saith since i have hemm d thee here
0	within the circuit of this ivory pale 
0	i ll be a park and thou shalt be my deer 
0	feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale 
0	graze on my lips and if those hills be dry 
0	stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie 
0	 within this limit is relief enough 
0	sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain 
0	round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough 
0	to shelter thee from tempest and from rain 
0	then be my deer since i am such a park 
0	no dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark 
0	at this adonis smiles as in disdain 
0	that in each cheek appears a pretty dimple 
0	love made those hollows if himself were slain 
0	he might be buried in a tomb so simple 
0	foreknowing well if there he came to lie 
0	why there love liv d and there he could not die 
0	these lovely caves these round enchanting pits 
0	open d their mouths to swallow venus liking 
0	being mad before how doth she now for wits 
0	struck dead at first what needs a second striking 
0	poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn 
0	to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn 
0	now which way shall she turn what shall she say 
0	her words are done her woes the more increasing 
0	the time is spent her object will away 
0	and from her twining arms doth urge releasing 
0	 pity she cries some favour some remorse 
0	away he springs and hasteth to his horse 
0	but lo from forth a copse that neighbours by 
0	a breeding jennet lusty young and proud 
0	adonis tramping courier doth espy 
0	and forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud 
0	the strong neck d steed being tied unto a tree 
0	breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he 
0	imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds 
0	and now his woven girths he breaks asunder 
0	the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds 
0	whose hollow womb resounds like heaven s thunder 
0	the iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth 
0	controlling what he was controlled with 
0	his ears up prick d his braided hanging mane
0	upon his compass d crest now stand on end 
0	his nostrils drink the air and forth again 
0	as from a furnace vapours doth he send 
0	his eye which scornfully glisters like fire 
0	shows his hot courage and his high desire 
0	sometime he trots as if he told the steps 
0	with gentle majesty and modest pride 
0	anon he rears upright curvets and leaps 
0	as who should say lo thus my strength is tried 
0	and this i do to captivate the eye
0	of the fair breeder that is standing by 
0	what recketh he his rider s angry stir 
0	his flattering holla or his stand i say 
0	what cares he now for curb or pricking spur 
0	for rich caparisons or trapping gay 
0	he sees his love and nothing else he sees 
0	nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees 
0	look when a painter would surpass the life 
0	in limning out a well proportion d steed 
0	his art with nature s workmanship at strife 
0	as if the dead the living should exceed 
0	so did this horse excel a common one 
0	in shape in courage colour pace and bone 
0	round hoof d short jointed fetlocks shag and long 
0	broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide 
0	high crest short ears straight legs and passing strong 
0	thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide 
0	look what a horse should have he did not lack 
0	save a proud rider on so proud a back 
0	sometimes he scuds far off and there he stares 
0	anon he starts at stirring of a feather 
0	to bid the wind a base he now prepares 
0	and whe r he run or fly they know not whether 
0	for through his mane and tail the high wind sings 
0	fanning the hairs who wave like feather d wings 
0	he looks upon his love and neighs unto her 
0	she answers him as if she knew his mind 
0	being proud as females are to see him woo her 
0	she puts on outward strangeness seems unkind 
0	spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels 
0	beating his kind embracements with her heels 
0	then like a melancholy malcontent 
0	he vails his tail that like a falling plume 
0	cool shadow to his melting buttock lent 
0	he stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume 
0	his love perceiving how he is enrag d 
0	grew kinder and his fury was assuag d 
0	his testy master goeth about to take him 
0	when lo the unback d breeder full of fear 
0	jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him 
0	with her the horse and left adonis there 
0	as they were mad unto the wood they hie them 
0	outstripping crows that strive to overfly them 
0	all swoln with chafing down adonis sits 
0	banning his boisterous and unruly beast 
0	and now the happy season once more fits 
0	that love sick love by pleading may be blest 
0	for lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
0	when it is barr d the aidance of the tongue 
0	an oven that is stopp d or river stay d 
0	burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage 
0	so of concealed sorrow may be said 
0	free vent of words love s fire doth assuage 
0	but when the heart s attorney once is mute
0	the client breaks as desperate in his suit 
0	he sees her coming and begins to glow 
0	even as a dying coal revives with wind 
0	and with his bonnet hides his angry brow 
0	looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind 
0	taking no notice that she is so nigh 
0	for all askance he holds her in his eye 
0	o what a sight it was wistly to view
0	how she came stealing to the wayward boy 
0	to note the fighting conflict of her hue 
0	how white and red each other did destroy 
0	but now her cheek was pale and by and by
0	now was she just before him as he sat 
0	and like a lowly lover down she kneels 
0	with one fair hand she heaveth up his hat 
0	her other tender hand his fair cheek feels 
0	his tenderer cheek receives her soft hand s print 
0	as apt as new fall n snow takes any dint 
0	o what a war of looks was then between them 
0	her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing 
0	his eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them 
0	her eyes woo d still his eyes disdain d the wooing 
0	with tears which chorus like her eyes did rain 
0	full gently now she takes him by the hand 
0	a lily prison d in a gaol of snow 
0	or ivory in an alabaster band 
0	so white a friend engirts so white a foe 
0	this beauteous combat wilful and unwilling 
0	show d like two silver doves that sit a billing 
0	once more the engine of her thoughts began 
0	 o fairest mover on this mortal round 
0	would thou wert as i am and i a man 
0	my heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound 
0	for one sweet look thy help i would assure thee 
0	though nothing but my body s bane would cure thee 
0	 give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it 
0	 give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it 
0	o give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it 
0	and being steel d soft sighs can never grave it 
0	then love s deep groans i never shall regard 
0	because adonis heart hath made mine hard 
0	 for shame he cries let go and let me go 
0	my day s delight is past my horse is gone 
0	and tis your fault i am bereft him so 
0	i pray you hence and leave me here alone 
0	for all my mind my thought my busy care 
0	is how to get my palfrey from the mare 
0	thus she replies thy palfrey as he should 
0	welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire 
0	affection is a coal that must be cool d 
0	else suffer d it will set the heart on fire 
0	the sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none 
0	therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone 
0	 how like a jade he stood tied to the tree 
0	servilely master d with a leathern rein 
0	but when he saw his love his youth s fair fee

0	who is so faint that dare not be so bold
0	to touch the fire the weather being cold 
0	 let me excuse thy courser gentle boy 
0	and learn of him i heartily beseech thee 
0	to take advantage on presented joy
0	o learn to love the lesson is but plain 
0	and once made perfect never lost again 
0	 i know not love quoth he nor will not know it 
0	unless it be a boar and then i chase it 
0	 tis much to borrow and i will not owe it 
0	my love to love is love but to disgrace it 
0	for i have heard it is a life in death 
0	that laughs and weeps and all but with a breath 
0	 who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish d 
0	who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth 
0	if springing things be any jot diminish d

0	 you hurt my hand with wringing let us part 
0	and leave this idle theme this bootless chat 
0	remove your siege from my unyielding heart 
0	to love s alarms it will not ope the gate 
0	dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery 
0	for where a heart is hard they make no battery 
0	 what canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue 
0	o would thou hadst not or i had no hearing 
0	thy mermaid s voice hath done me double wrong 
0	i had my load before now press d with bearing 
0	melodious discord heavenly tune harsh sounding 
0	ear s deep sweet music and heart s deep sore wounding 
0	 had i no eyes but ears my ears would love
0	that inward beauty and invisible 
0	or were i deaf thy outward parts would move
0	each part in me that were but sensible 
0	though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see 
0	yet should i be in love by touching thee 
0	 say that the sense of feeling were bereft me 
0	and that i could not see nor hear nor touch 
0	and nothing but the very smell were left me 
0	yet would my love to thee be still as much 
0	for from the stillitory of thy face excelling
0	comes breath perfum d that breedeth love by smelling 
0	 but o what banquet wert thou to the taste 
0	being nurse and feeder of the other four 
0	would they not wish the feast might ever last 
0	and bid suspicion double lock the door 
0	lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest

0	wrack to the seaman tempest to the field 
0	sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds 
0	gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds 
0	this ill presage advisedly she marketh

0	or as the berry breaks before it staineth 
0	or like the deadly bullet of a gun 
0	his meaning struck her ere his words begun 
0	and at his look she flatly falleth down
0	for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth 
0	a smile recures the wounding of a frown 
0	but blessed bankrupt that by love so thriveth 
0	the silly boy believing she is dead
0	and all amaz d brake off his late intent 
0	for sharply he did think to reprehend her 
0	which cunning love did wittily prevent 
0	fair fall the wit that can so well defend her 
0	for on the grass she lies as she were slain
0	till his breath breatheth life in her again 
0	he wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks 
0	he bends her fingers holds her pulses hard 
0	he chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks
0	to mend the hurt that his unkindness marr d 
0	he kisses her and she by her good will 
0	will never rise so he will kiss her still 
0	the night of sorrow now is turn d to day 
0	her two blue windows faintly she up heaveth 
0	like the fair sun when in his fresh array

0	 now let me say good night and so say you 
0	if you will say so you shall have a kiss 
0	 good night quoth she and ere he says adieu 
0	the honey fee of parting tender d is 
0	her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace 
0	incorporate then they seem face grows to face 
0	till breathless he disjoin d and backward drew

0	and having felt the sweetness of the spoil 
0	with blindfold fury she begins to forage 
0	her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil

0	planting oblivion beating reason back 
0	forgetting shame s pure blush and honour s wrack 
0	hot faint and weary with her hard embracing 
0	like a wild bird being tam d with too much handling

0	what wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering 
0	and yields at last to every light impression 
0	things out of hope are compass d oft with venturing 
0	chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission 
0	affection faints not like a pale fac d coward

0	foul words and frowns must not repel a lover 
0	what though the rose have prickles yet tis pluck d 
0	were beauty under twenty locks kept fast 
0	yet love breaks through and picks them all at last 
0	for pity now she can no more detain him 
0	the poor fool prays her that he may depart 
0	she is resolv d no longer to restrain him

0	the which by cupid s bow she doth protest 
0	he carries thence incaged in his breast 
0	 sweet boy she says this night i ll waste in sorrow 
0	for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch 
0	tell me love s master shall we meet to morrow
0	say shall we shall we wilt thou make the match 
0	he tells her no to morrow he intends
0	to hunt the boar with certain of his friends 
0	 the boar quoth she whereat a sudden pale 
0	like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose 
0	usurps her cheeks she trembles at his tale 
0	and on his neck her yoking arms she throws 
0	she sinketh down still hanging by his neck 
0	he on her belly falls she on her back 
0	now is she in the very lists of love 
0	her champion mounted for the hot encounter 
0	all is imaginary she doth prove 
0	he will not manage her although he mount her 
0	that worse than tantalus is her annoy 
0	to clip elysium and to lack her joy 
0	even as poor birds deceiv d with painted grapes 
0	do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw 
0	even so she languisheth in her mishaps

0	she seeks to kindle with continual kissing 
0	but all in vain good queen it will not be 
0	she hath assay d as much as may be prov d

0	 fie fie he says you crush me let me go 
0	you have no reason to withhold me so 
0	 thou hadst been gone quoth she sweet boy ere this 
0	but that thou told st me thou wouldst hunt the boar 
0	o be advis d thou know st not what it is
0	with javelin s point a churlish swine to gore 
0	whose tushes never sheath d he whetteth still 
0	like to a mortal butcher bent to kill 
0	 on his bow back he hath a battle set
0	of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes 
0	his eyes like glow worms shine when he doth fret 
0	his snout digs sepulchres where er he goes 
0	being mov d he strikes whate er is in his way 
0	and whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay 
0	 his brawny sides with hairy bristles arm d 
0	are better proof than thy spear s point can enter 
0	his short thick neck cannot be easily harm d 
0	being ireful on the lion he will venture 
0	the thorny brambles and embracing bushes 
0	as fearful of him part through whom he rushes 
0	 alas he nought esteems that face of thine 
0	to which love s eyes pay tributary gazes 
0	nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne 
0	whose full perfection all the world amazes 
0	but having thee at vantage wondrous dread 
0	would root these beauties as he roots the mead 
0	 o let him keep his loathsome cabin still 
0	beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends 
0	come not within his danger by thy will 
0	they that thrive well take counsel of their friends 
0	when thou didst name the boar not to dissemble 
0	i fear d thy fortune and my joints did tremble 
0	 didst thou not mark my face was it not white 
0	saw st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye 
0	grew i not faint and fell i not downright 
0	within my bosom whereon thou dost lie 
0	my boding heart pants beats and takes no rest 
0	but like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast 
0	 for where love reigns disturbing jealousy
0	doth call himself affection s sentinel 
0	gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny 
0	and in a peaceful hour doth cry kill kill 
0	distempering gentle love in his desire 
0	as air and water do abate the fire 
0	 this sour informer this bate breeding spy 
0	this canker that eats up love s tender spring 
0	this carry tale dissentious jealousy 
0	that sometime true news sometime false doth bring 
0	knocks at my heart and whispers in mine ear
0	that if i love thee i thy death should fear 
0	 and more than so presenteth to mine eye
0	the picture of an angry chafing boar 
0	under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
0	an image like thyself all stain d with gore 
0	whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
0	doth make them droop with grief and hang the head 
0	 what should i do seeing thee so indeed 
0	that tremble at the imagination 
0	the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed 
0	and fear doth teach it divination 
0	i prophesy thy death my living sorrow 
0	if thou encounter with the boar to morrow 
0	 but if thou needs wilt hunt be rul d by me 
0	uncouple at the timorous flying hare 
0	or at the fox which lives by subtilty 
0	or at the roe which no encounter dare 
0	pursue these fearful creatures o er the downs 
0	and on thy well breath d horse keep with thy hound 
0	 and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare 
0	mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles
0	how he outruns the winds and with what care
0	he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles 
0	the many musits through the which he goes
0	are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes 
0	 sometime he runs among a flock of sheep 
0	to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell 
0	and sometime where earth delving conies keep 
0	to stop the loud pursuers in their yell 
0	and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer 
0	danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear 
0	 for there his smell with others being mingled 
0	the hot scent snuffing hounds are driven to doubt 
0	ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
0	with much ado the cold fault cleanly out 
0	then do they spend their mouths echo replies 
0	as if another chase were in the skies 
0	 by this poor wat far off upon a hill 
0	stands on his hinder legs with listening ear 
0	to hearken if his foes pursue him still 
0	anon their loud alarums he doth hear 
0	and now his grief may be compared well
0	to one sore sick that hears the passing bell 
0	 then shalt thou see the dew bedabbled wretch
0	turn and return indenting with the way 
0	each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch 
0	each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay 
0	for misery is trodden on by many 
0	and being low never reliev d by any 
0	 lie quietly and hear a little more 
0	nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise 
0	to make thee hate the hunting of the boar 
0	unlike myself thou hear st me moralize 
0	applying this to that and so to so 
0	for love can comment upon every woe 
0	 where did i leave no matter where quoth he
0	 leave me and then the story aptly ends 
0	the night is spent why what of that quoth she 
0	 i am quoth he expected of my friends 
0	and now tis dark and going i shall fall 
0	but if thou fall o then imagine this 
0	the earth in love with thee thy footing trips 
0	and all is but to rob thee of a kiss 
0	rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips
0	make modest dian cloudy and forlorn 
0	lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn 
0	 now of this dark night i perceive the reason 
0	cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine
0	till forging nature be condemn d of treason 
0	for stealing moulds from heaven that were divine 
0	wherein she fram d thee in high heaven s despite 
0	to shame the sun by day and her by night 
0	 and therefore hath she brib d the destinies 
0	to cross the curious workmanship of nature
0	to mingle beauty with infirmities 
0	and pure perfection with impure defeature 
0	making it subject to the tyranny
0	of mad mischances and much misery 
0	 as burning fevers agues pale and faint 
0	life poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood 
0	the marrow eating sickness whose attains
0	disorder breeds by heating of the blood 
0	surfeits imposthumes grief and damn d despair 
0	swear nature s death for framing thee so fair 
0	 and not the least of all these maladies
0	but in one minute s fight brings beauty under 
0	both favour savour hue and qualities 
0	whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder 
0	are on the sudden wasted thaw d and done 
0	as mountain snow melts with the mid day sun 
0	 therefore despite of fruitless chastity 
0	love lacking vestals and self loving nuns 
0	that on the earth would breed a scarcity
0	and barren dearth of daughters and of sons 
0	be prodigal the lamp that burns by night
0	dries up his oil to lend the world his light 
0	 what is thy body but a swallowing grave 
0	seeming to bury that posterity
0	which by the rights of time thou needs must have 
0	if thou destroy them not in dark obscurity 
0	if so the world will hold thee in disdain 
0	sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain 
0	 so in thyself thyself art made away 
0	a mischief worse than civil home bred strife 
0	or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay 
0	or butcher sire that reeves his son of life 
0	foul cankering rust the hidden treasure frets 
0	but gold that s put to use more gold begets 
0	 nay then quoth adon you will fall again
0	into your idle over handled theme 
0	the kiss i gave you is bestow d in vain 
0	and all in vain you strive against the stream 
0	for by this black fac d night desire s foul nurse 
0	your treatise makes me like you worse and worse 
0	 if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues 
0	and every tongue more moving than your own 
0	bewitching like the wanton mermaid s songs 
0	yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown 
0	for know my heart stands armed in mine ear 
0	and will not let a false sound enter there 
0	 lest the deceiving harmony should run
0	into the quiet closure of my breast 
0	and then my little heart were quite undone 
0	in his bedchamber to be barr d of rest 
0	no lady no my heart longs not to groan 
0	but soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone 
0	 what have you urg d that i cannot reprove 
0	the path is smooth that leadeth on to danger 
0	i hate not love but your device in love
0	that lends embracements unto every stranger 
0	you do it for increase o strange excuse 
0	when reason is the bawd to lust s abuse 
0	 call it not love for love to heaven is fled 
0	since sweating lust on earth usurp d his name 
0	under whose simple semblance he hath fed
0	upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame 
0	which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves 
0	as caterpillars do the tender leaves 
0	 love comforteth like sunshine after rain 
0	but lust s effect is tempest after sun 
0	love s gentle spring doth always fresh remain 
0	lust s winter comes ere summer half be done 
0	love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies 
0	love is all truth lust full of forged lies 
0	 more i could tell but more i dare not say 
0	the text is old the orator too green 
0	therefore in sadness now i will away 
0	my face is full of shame my heart of teen 
0	mine ears that to your wanton talk attended
0	do burn themselves for having so offended 
0	with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
0	of those fair arms which bound him to her breast 
0	and homeward through the dark laund runs apace 
0	leaves love upon her back deeply distress d 
0	look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
0	so glides he in the night from venus eye 
0	which after him she darts as one on shore
0	gazing upon a late embarked friend 
0	till the wild waves will have him seen no more 
0	whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend 
0	so did the merciless and pitchy night
0	fold in the object that did feed her sight 
0	whereat amaz d as one that unaware
0	or stonish d as night wanderers often are 
0	their light blown out in some mistrustful wood 
0	even so confounded in the dark she lay 
0	having lost the fair discovery of her way 
0	and now she beats her heart whereat it groans 
0	that all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled 
0	make verbal repetition of her moans 
0	passion on passion deeply is redoubled 
0	 ay me she cries and twenty times woe woe 
0	and twenty echoes twenty times cry so 
0	she marking them begins a wailing note 
0	and sings extemporally a woeful ditty 
0	how love makes young men thrall and old men dote 
0	how love is wise in folly foolish witty 
0	her heavy anthem still concludes in woe 
0	and still the choir of echoes answer so 
0	her song was tedious and outwore the night 
0	for lovers hours are long though seeming short 
0	if pleas d themselves others they think delight
0	in such like circumstance with such like sport 
0	their copious stories oftentimes begun 
0	end without audience and are never done 
0	for who hath she to spend the night withal 
0	but idle sounds resembling parasites 
0	like shrill tongu d tapsters answering every call 
0	soothing the humour of fantastic wits 
0	she says tis so they answer all tis so 
0	and would say after her if she said no 
0	lo here the gentle lark weary of rest 
0	from his moist cabinet mounts up on high 
0	and wakes the morning from whose silver breast
0	the sun ariseth in his majesty 
0	who doth the world so gloriously behold 
0	that cedar tops and hills seem burnish d gold 
0	venus salutes him with this fair good morrow 
0	 o thou clear god and patron of all light 
0	from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
0	the beauteous influence that makes him bright 
0	there lives a son that suck d an earthly mother 
0	may lend thee light as thou dost lend to other 
0	this said she hasteth to a myrtle grove 
0	musing the morning is so much o erworn 
0	and yet she hears no tidings of her love 
0	she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn 
0	anon she hears them chant it lustily 
0	and all in haste she coasteth to the cry 
0	and as she runs the bushes in the way
0	some catch her by the neck some kiss her face 
0	some twine about her thigh to make her stay 
0	she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace 
0	like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache 
0	hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake 
0	by this she hears the hounds are at a bay 
0	whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
0	wreath d up in fatal folds just in his way 
0	the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder 
0	even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
0	appals her senses and her spirit confounds 
0	for now she knows it is no gentle chase 
0	but the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud 
0	because the cry remaineth in one place 
0	wilere fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud 
0	finding their enemy to be so curst 
0	they all strain courtesy who shall cope him first 
0	this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear 
0	througll which it enters to surprise her heart 
0	who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear 
0	with cold pale weakness numbs each feeling part 
0	like soldiers when their captain once doth yield 
0	they basely fly and dare not stay the field 
0	thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy 
0	till cheering up her senses sore dismay d 
0	she tells them tis a causeless fantasy 
0	and childish error that they are afraid 
0	bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more 
0	and with that word she spied the hunted boar 
0	whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red 
0	like milk and blood being mingled both together 
0	a second fear through all her sinews spread 
0	which madly hurries her she knows not whither 
0	this way she runs and now she will no further 
0	but back retires to rate the boar for murther 
0	a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways 
0	she treads the path that she untreads again 
0	her more than haste is mated with delays 
0	like the proceedings of a drunken brain 
0	full of respects yet nought at all respecting 
0	in hand with all things nought at all effecting 
0	here kennel d in a brake she finds a hound 
0	and asks the weary caitiff for his master 
0	and there another licking of his wound 
0	gainst venom d sores the only sovereign plaster 
0	and here she meets another sadly scowling 
0	to whom she speaks and he replies with howling 
0	when he hath ceas d his ill resounding noise 
0	another flap mouth d mourner black and grim 
0	against the welkin volleys out his voice 
0	another and another answer him 
0	clapping their proud tails to the ground below 
0	shaking their scratch d ears bleeding as they go 
0	look how the world s poor people are amaz d
0	at apparitions signs and prodigies 
0	whereon with fearful eyes they long have gaz d 
0	infusing them with dreadful prophecies 
0	so she at these sad sighs draws up her breath 
0	and sighing it again exclaims on death 
0	 hard favour d tyrant ugly meagre lean 
0	hateful divorce of love thus chides she death 
0	 grim grinning ghost earth s worm what dost thou mean
0	to stifle beauty and to steal his breath 
0	who when he liv d his breath and beauty set
0	gloss on the rose smell to the violet 
0	 if he be dead o no it cannot be 
0	seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it 
0	o yes it may thou hast no eyes to see 
0	but hatefully at random dost thou hit 
0	thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart
0	mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant s heart 
0	 hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke 
0	and hearing him thy power had lost his power 
0	the destinies will curse thee for this stroke 
0	they bid thee crop a weed thou pluck st a flower 
0	love s golden arrow at him shoull have fled 
0	and not death s ebon dart to strike him dead 
0	 dost thou drink tears that thou provok st such weeping 
0	what may a heavy groan advantage thee 
0	why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
0	those eyes that taught all other eyes to see 
0	now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
0	since her best work is ruin d with thy rigour 
0	here overcome as one full of despair 
0	she vail d her eyelids who like sluices stopp d
0	the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
0	in the sweet channel of her bosom dropp d
0	but through the flood gates breaks the silver rain 
0	and with his strong course opens them again 
0	o how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow 
0	her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye 
0	both crystals where they view d each other s sorrow 
0	sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry 
0	but like a stormy day now wind now rain 
0	sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again 
0	variable passions throng her constant woe 
0	as striving who should best become her grief 
0	all entertain d each passion labours so 
0	that every present sorrow seemeth chief 
0	but none is best then join they all together 
0	like many clouds consulting for foul weather 
0	by this far off she hears some huntsman holloa 
0	a nurse s song no er pleas d her babe so well 
0	the dire imagination she did follow
0	this sound of hope doth labour to expel 
0	for now reviving joy bids her rejoice 
0	and flatters her it is adonis voice 
0	whereat her tears began to turn their tide 
0	being prison d in her eye like pearls in glass 
0	yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside 
0	which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass
0	who is but drunken when she seemeth drown d 
0	o hard believing love how strange it seems
0	not to believe and yet too credulous 
0	thy weal and woe are both of them extremes 
0	despair and hope make thee ridiculous 
0	the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely 
0	in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly 
0	now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought 
0	adonis lives and death is not to blame 
0	it was not she that call d him all to naught 
0	now she adds honours to his hateful name 
0	she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings 
0	imperious supreme of all mortal things 
0	 no no quoth she sweet death i did but jest 
0	yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear
0	whenas i met the boar that bloody beast 
0	which knows no pity but is still severe 
0	then gentle shadow truth i must confess 
0	i rail d on thee fearing my love s decease 
0	 tis not my fault the boar provok d my tongue 
0	be wreak d on him invisible commander 
0	 tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong 
0	i did but act he s author of my slander 
0	grief hath two tongues and never woman yet 
0	could rule them both without ten women s wit 
0	thus hoping that adonis is alive 
0	her rash suspect sile doth extenuate 
0	and that his beauty may the better thrive 
0	with death she humbly doth insinuate 
0	tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories
0	his victories his triumphs and his glories 
0	 o jove quoth she how much a fool was i 
0	to be of such a weak and silly mind
0	to wail his death who lives and must not die
0	till mutual overthrow of mortal kind 
0	for he being dead with him is beauty slain 
0	and beauty dead black chaos comes again 
0	 fie fie fond love thou art so full of fear
0	as one with treasure laden hemm d with thieves
0	trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear 
0	thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves 
0	even at this word she hears a merry horn
0	whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn 
0	as falcon to the lure away she flies 
0	the grass stoops not she treads on it so light 
0	and in her haste unfortunately spies
0	the foul boar s conquest on her fair delight 
0	which seen her eyes as murder d with the view 
0	like stars asham d of day themselves withdrew 
0	or as the snail whose tender horns being hit 
0	shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain 
0	and there all smother d up in shade doth sit 
0	long after fearing to creep forth again 
0	so at his bloody view her eyes are fled
0	into the deep dark cabills of her head 
0	where they resign their office and their light
0	to the disposing of her troubled brain 
0	who bids them still consort with ugly night 
0	and never wound the heart with looks again 
0	who like a king perplexed in his throne 
0	by their suggestion gives a deadly groan 
0	whereat each tributary subject quakes 
0	as when the wind imprison d in the ground 
0	struggling for passage earth s foundation shakes 
0	which with cold terror doth men s minds confound 
0	this mutiny each part doth so surprise
0	that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes 
0	and being open d threw unwilling light
0	upon the wide wound that the boar had trench d
0	in his soft flank whose wonted lily white
0	with purple tears that his wound wept was drench d 
0	no flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed
0	but stole his blood and seem d with him to bleed 
0	this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth 
0	over one shoulder doth she hang her head 
0	she thinks he could not die he is not dead 
0	her voice is stopp d her joints forget to bow 
0	her eyes are mad that they have wept till now 
0	upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly 
0	that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three 
0	and then she reprehends her mangling eye 
0	that makes more gashes where no breach should be 
0	his face seems twain each several limb is doubled 
0	for oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled 
0	 my tongue cannot express my grief for one 
0	and yet quoth she behold two adons dead 
0	my sighs are blown away my salt tears gone 
0	mine eyes are turn d to fire my heart to lead 
0	heavy heart s lead melt at mine eyes red fire 
0	so shall i die by drops of hot desire 
0	 alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost 
0	what face remains alive that s worth the viewing 
0	whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast
0	of things long since or anything ensuing 
0	the flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim 
0	but true sweet beauty liv d and died with him 
0	 bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear 
0	nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you 
0	having no fair to lose you need not fear 
0	the sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you 
0	but when adonis liv d sun and sharp air
0	lurk d like two thieves to rob him of his fair 
0	 and therefore would he put his bonnet on 
0	under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep 
0	the wind would blow it off and being gone 
0	play with his locks then would adonis weep 
0	and straight in pity of his tender years 
0	they both would strive who first should dry his tears 
0	 to see his face the lion walk d along
0	behind some hedge because he would not fear him 
0	to recreate himself when he hath sung 
0	the tiger would be tame and gently hear him 
0	if he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey 
0	and never fright the silly lamb that day 
0	 when he beheld his shadow in the brook 
0	the fishes spread on it their golden gills 
0	when he was by the birds such pleasure took 
0	that some would sing some other in their bills
0	would bring him mulberries and ripe red cherries
0	he fed them with his sight they him with berries 
0	 but this foul grim and urchin spouted boar 
0	whose downward eye still looketh for a grave 
0	ne er saw the beauteous livery that he wore 
0	witness the entertainment that he gave 
0	if he did see his face why then i know
0	he thought to kiss him and hath killed him so 
0	 tis true tis true thus was adonis slain 
0	he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear 
0	who did not whet his teeth at him again 
0	but by a kiss thought to persuade him there 
0	and nuzzling in his flank the loving swine
0	sheath d unaware the tusk in his soft groin 
0	 had i been tooth d like him i must confess 
0	with kissing him i should have kill d him first 
0	but he is dead and never did he bless
0	my youth with his the more am i accurst 
0	with this she falleth in the place she stood 
0	and stains her face with his congealed blood 
0	sho looks upon his lips and they are pale 
0	she takes him by the hand and that is cold 
0	she whispers in his ears a heavy tale 
0	as if they heard the woeful words she told 
0	she lifts the coffer lids that close his eyes 
0	where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies 
0	two glasses where herself herself beheld
0	a thousand times and now no more reflect 
0	their virtue lost wherein they late excell d 
0	and every beauty robb d of his effect 
0	 wonder of time quoth she this is my spite 
0	that you being dead the day should yet be light 
0	 since thou art dead lo here i prophesy 
0	sorrow on love hereafter shall attend 
0	it shall be waited on with jealousy 
0	find sweet beginning but unsavoury end 
0	ne er settled equally but high or low 
0	that all love s pleasure shall not match his woe 
0	 it shall be fickle false and full of fraud 
0	bud and be blasted in a breathing while 
0	the bottom poison and the top o erstraw d
0	with sweets that shall the truest sight beguile 
0	the strongest body shall it make most weak 
0	 it shall be sparing and too full of riot 
0	teaching decrepit age to tread the measures 
0	the staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet 
0	pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures 
0	it shall be raging mad and silly mild 
0	make the young old the old become a child 
0	 it shall suspect where is no cause of fear 
0	it shall not fear where it should most mistrust 
0	it shall be merciful and too severe 
0	and most deceiving when it seems most just 
0	perverse it shall be where it shows most toward 
0	put fear to velour courage to the coward 
0	 it shall be cause of war and dire events 
0	and set dissension twixt the son and sire 
0	subject and servile to all discontents 
0	as dry combustious matter is to fire 
0	sith in his prime death doth my love destroy 
0	by this the boy that by her side lay kill d
0	was melted like a vapour from her sight 
0	and in his blood that on the ground lay spill d 
0	a purple flower sprung up chequer d with white 
0	resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
0	which in round drops upon their whiteness stood 
0	she bows her head the new sprung flower to smell 
0	comparing it to her adonis breath 
0	and says within her bosom it shall dwell 
0	since he himself is reft from her by death 
0	she drops the stalk and in the breach appears
0	green dropping sap which she compares to tears 
0	 poor flower quoth she this was thy father s guise 
0	sweet issue of a more sweet smelling sire 
0	for every little grief to wet his eyes 
0	to grow unto himself was his desire 
0	and so tis shine but know it is as good
0	to wither in my breast as in his blood 
0	 here was thy father s bed here in my breast 
0	thou art the next of blood and tis thy right 
0	lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest 
0	my throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night 
0	there shall not be one minute in an hour
0	wherein i will not kiss my sweet love s flower 
0	thus weary of the world away she hies 
0	and yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
0	their mistress mounted through the empty skies
0	in her light chariot quickly is convey d 
0	holding their course to paphos where their queen
0	means to immure herself and not be seen 
0	did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye 
0	 gainst whom the world could not hold argument 
0	persuade my heart to this false perjury 
0	vows for thee broke deserve not punishment 
0	a woman i forswore but i will prove 
0	thou being a goddess i forswore not thee 
0	my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love 
0	thy grace being gain d cures all disgrace in me 
0	my vow was breath and breath a vapour is 
0	then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine 
0	exhale this vapour vow in thee it is 
0	if broken then it is no fault of mine 
0	if by me broke what fool is not so wise
0	to break an oath to win a paradise 
0	sweet cytherea sitting by a brook
0	with young adonis lovely fresh and green 
0	did court the lad with many a lovely look 
0	such looks as none could look but beauty s queen 
0	she told him stories to delight his ear 
0	she show d him favours to allure his eye 
0	to win his heart she touch d him here and there 
0	touches so soft still conquer chastity 
0	but whether unripe years did want conceit 
0	or he refus d to take her figur d proffer 
0	the tender nibbler would not touch the bait 
0	but smile and jest at every gentle offer 
0	then fell she on her back fair queen and toward 
0	he rose and ran away ah fool too froward 
0	if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love 
0	o never faith could hold if not to beauty vow d 
0	though to myself forsworn to thee i ll constant prove 
0	those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bow d 
0	study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes 
0	where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend 
0	if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice 
0	well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend 
0	all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder 
0	which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire 
0	thy eye jove s lightning seems thy voice his dreadful thunder 
0	which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire 
0	celestial as thou art o do not love that wrong 
0	to sing heavens praise with such an earthly tongue 
0	scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn 
0	and scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade 
0	when cytherea all in love forlorn 
0	a longing tarriance for adonis made 
0	under an osier growing by a brook 
0	a brook where adon used to cool his spleen 
0	hot was the day she hotter that did look
0	for his approach that often there had been 
0	anon he comes and throws his mantle by 
0	and stood stark naked on the brook s green brim

0	mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty

0	softer than wax and yet as iron rusty 
0	a lily pale with damask die to grace her 
0	none fairer nor none falser to deface her 
0	her lips to mine how often hath she join d 
0	between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing 
0	how many tales to please me hath she coin d 
0	dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing 
0	yet in the midst of all her pure protestings 
0	her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings 
0	she burn d with love as straw with fire flameth 
0	she burn d out love as soon as straw outburneth 
0	she fram d the love and yet she foil d the framing 
0	she bade love last and yet she fell a turning 
0	was this a lover or a lecher whether 
0	bad in the best though excellent in neither 
0	if music and sweet poetry agree 
0	as they must needs the sister and the brother 
0	then must the love be great twixt thee and me 
0	because thou lovest the one and i the other 
0	dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch
0	upon the lute doth ravish human sense 
0	spenser to me whose deep conceit is such
0	as passing all conceit needs no defence 
0	thou lov st to hear the sweet melodious sound
0	that phoebus lute the queen of music makes 
0	and i in deep delight am chiefly drown d
0	whenas himself to singing he betakes 
0	one god is god of both as poets feign 
0	one knight loves both and both in thee remain 
0	fair was the morn when the fair queen of love 
0	paler for sorrow than her milk white dove 
0	for adon s sake a youngster proud and wild 
0	her stand she takes upon a steep up hill 
0	anon adonis comes with horn and hounds 
0	she silly queen with more than love s good will 
0	forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds 
0	once quoth she did i see a fair sweet youth
0	here in these brakes deep wounded with a boar 
0	deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth

0	in that high task hath done her beauty wrong 
0	which far exceeds his barren skill to show 
0	therefore that praise which collatine doth owe
0	enchanted tarquin answers with surmise 
0	in silent wonder of still gazing eyes 
0	this earthly saint adored by this devil 
0	little suspecteth the false worshipper 
0	for unstain d thoughts do seldom dream on evil 
0	birds never limed no secret bushes fear 
0	so guiltless she securely gives good cheer
0	and reverend welcome to her princely guest 
0	whose inward ill no outward harm express d 
0	for that he colour d with his high estate 
0	hiding base sin in plaits of majesty 
0	that nothing in him seem d inordinate 
0	save sometime too much wonder of his eye 
0	which having all all could not satisfy 
0	but poorly rich so wanteth in his store 
0	that cloy d with much he pineth still for more 
0	but she that never coped with stranger eyes 
0	could pick no meaning from their parling looks 
0	nor read the subtle shining secrecies
0	writ in the glassy margents of such books 
0	she touch d no unknown baits nor fear d no hooks 
0	nor could she moralize his wanton sight 
0	more than his eyes were open d to the light 
0	he stories to her ears her husband s fame 
0	won in the fields of fruitful italy 
0	and decks with praises collatine s high name 
0	made glorious by his manly chivalry
0	with bruised arms and wreaths of victory 
0	her joy with heaved up hand she doth express 
0	and wordless so greets heaven for his success 
0	far from the purpose of his coming hither 
0	he makes excuses for his being there 
0	no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
0	doth yet in his fair welkin once appear 
0	till sable night mother of dread and fear 
0	upon the world dim darkness doth display 
0	and in her vaulty prison stows the day 
0	for then is tarquin brought unto his bed 
0	intending weariness with heavy spright 
0	for after supper long he questioned
0	with modest lucrece and wore out the night 
0	now leaden slumber with life s strength doth fight 
0	and every one to rest themselves betake 
0	save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake 
0	as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving
0	the sundry dangers of his will s obtaining 
0	yet ever to obtain his will resolving 
0	though weak built hopes persuade him to abstaining 
0	despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining 
0	and when great treasure is the meed proposed 
0	though death be adjunct there s no death supposed 
0	those that much covet are with gain so fond 
0	for what they have not that which they possess
0	they scatter and unloose it from their bond 
0	and so by hoping more they have but less 
0	or gaining more the profit of excess
0	is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain 
0	that they prove bankrupt in this poor rich gain 
0	the aim of all is but to nurse the life
0	with honour wealth and ease in waning age 
0	and in this aim there is such thwarting strife 
0	that one for all or all for one we gage 
0	as life for honour in fell battle s rage 
0	honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost
0	the death of all and all together lost 
0	so that in venturing ill we leave to be
0	the things we are for that which we expect 
0	and this ambitious foul infirmity 
0	in having much torments us with defect
0	of that we have so then we do neglect
0	the thing we have and all for want of wit 
0	make something nothing by augmenting it 
0	such hazard now must doting tarquin make 
0	pawning his honour to obtain his lust 
0	and for himself himself he must forsake 
0	then where is truth if there be no self trust 
0	when shall he think to find a stranger just 
0	when he himself himself confounds betrays
0	to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days 
0	now stole upon the time the dead of night 
0	when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes 
0	no comfortable star did lend his light 
0	no noise but owls and wolves death boding cries 
0	now serves the season that they may surprise
0	the silly lambs pure thoughts are dead and still 
0	while lust and murder wake to stain and kill 
0	and now this lustful lord leap d from his bed 
0	throwing his mantle rudely o er his arm 
0	is madly toss d between desire and dread 
0	th one sweetly flatters th other feareth harm 
0	but honest fear bewitch d with lust s foul charm 
0	doth too too oft betake him to retire 
0	beaten away by brain sick rude desire 
0	his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth 
0	that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly 
0	whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth 
0	which must be lode star to his lustful eye 
0	and to the flame thus speaks advisedly 
0	 as from this cold flint i enforced this fire 
0	so lucrece must i force to my desire 
0	here pale with fear he doth premeditate
0	the dangers of his loathsome enterprise 
0	and in his inward mind he doth debate
0	what following sorrow may on this arise 
0	then looking scornfully he doth despise
0	his naked armour of still slaughter d lust 
0	and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust 
0	 fair torch burn out thy light and lend it not
0	to darken her whose light excelleth thine 
0	and die unhallow d thoughts before you blot
0	with your uncleanness that which is divine 
0	offer pure incense to so pure a shrine 
0	let fair humanity abhor the deed
0	that spots and stains love s modest snow white weed 
0	 o shame to knighthood and to shining arms 
0	o foul dishonour to my household s grave 
0	o impious act including all foul harms 
0	a martial man to be soft fancy s slave 
0	true valour still a true respect should have 
0	then my digression is so vile so base 
0	that it will live engraven in my face 
0	 yea though i die the scandal will survive 
0	and be an eye sore in my golden coat 
0	some loathsome dash the herald will contrive 
0	to cipher me how fondly i did dote 
0	that my posterity shamed with the note 
0	shall curse my bones and hold it for no sin
0	to wish that i their father had not been 
0	 what win i if i gain the thing i seek 
0	a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy 
0	who buys a minute s mirth to wail a week 
0	or sells eternity to get a toy 
0	for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy 
0	or what fond beggar but to touch the crown 
0	would with the sceptre straight be strucken down 
0	 if collatinus dream of my intent 
0	will he not wake and in a desperate rage
0	post hither this vile purpose to prevent 
0	this siege that hath engirt his marriage 
0	this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage 
0	this dying virtue this surviving shame 
0	whose crime will bear an ever during blame 
0	 o what excuse can my invention make 
0	when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed 
0	will not my tongue be mute my frail joints shake 
0	mine eyes forego their light my false heart bleed 
0	the guilt being great the fear doth still exceed 
0	and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly 
0	but coward like with trembling terror die 
0	 had collatinus kill d my son or sire 
0	or lain in ambush to betray my life 
0	or were he not my dear friend this desire
0	might have excuse to work upon his wife 
0	as in revenge or quittal of such strife 
0	but as he is my kinsman my dear friend 
0	the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end 
0	 shameful it is ay if the fact be known 
0	hateful it is there is no hate in loving 
0	i ll beg her love but she is not her own 
0	the worst is but denial and reproving 
0	my will is strong past reason s weak removing 
0	who fears a sentence or an old man s saw
0	shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe 
0	thus graceless holds he disputation
0	 tween frozen conscience and hot burning will 
0	and with good thoughts makes dispensation 
0	urging the worser sense for vantage still 
0	which in a moment doth confound and kill
0	all pure effects and doth so far proceed 
0	that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed 
0	quoth he she took me kindly by the hand 
0	and gazed for tidings in my eager eyes 
0	fearing some hard news from the warlike band 
0	where her beloved collatinus lies 
0	o how her fear did make her colour rise 
0	first red as roses that on lawn we lay 
0	then white as lawn the roses took away 
0	 and how her hand in my hand being lock d 
0	forced it to tremble with her loyal fear 
0	which struck her sad and then it faster rock d 
0	until her husband s welfare she did hear 
0	whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer 
0	that had narcissus seen her as she stood 
0	self love had never drown d him in the flood 
0	 why hunt i then for colour or excuses 
0	poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses 
0	love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth 
0	affection is my captain and he leadeth 
0	and when his gaudy banner is display d 
0	the coward fights and will not be dismay d 
0	 then childish fear avaunt debating die 
0	respect and reason wait on wrinkled age 
0	my heart shall never countermand mine eye 
0	sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage 
0	my part is youth and beats these from the stage 
0	desire my pilot is beauty my prize 
0	then who fears sinking where such treasure lies 
0	as corn o ergrown by weeds so heedful fear
0	is almost choked by unresisted lust 
0	away he steals with open listening ear 
0	full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust 
0	both which as servitors to the unjust 
0	so cross him with their opposite persuasion 
0	that now he vows a league and now invasion 
0	within his thought her heavenly image sits 
0	and in the self same seat sits collatine 
0	that eye which locks on her confounds his wits 
0	that eye which him beholds as more divine 
0	unto a view so false will not incline 
0	but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart 
0	which once corrupted takes the worser part 
0	and therein heartens up his servile powers 
0	who flatter d by their leader s jocund show 
0	stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours 
0	and as their captain so their pride doth grow 
0	paying more slavish tribute than they owe 
0	by reprobate desire thus madly led 
0	the roman lord marcheth to lucrece bed 
0	the locks between her chamber and his will 
0	each one by him enforced retires his ward 
0	but as they open they all rate his ill 
0	which drives the creeping thief to some regard 
0	the threshold grates the door to have him heard 
0	night wandering weasels shriek to see him there 
0	they fright him yet he still pursues his fear 
0	as each unwilling portal yields him way 
0	through little vents and crannies of the place
0	the wind wars with his torch to make him stay 
0	and blows the smoke of it into his face 
0	extinguishing his conduct in this case 
0	but his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch 
0	puffs forth another wind that fires the torch 
0	and being lighted by the light he spies
0	lucretia s glove wherein her needle sticks 
0	he takes it from the rushes where it lies 
0	and griping it the needle his finger pricks 
0	as who should say this glove to wanton tricks
0	is not inured return again in haste 
0	thou see st our mistress ornaments are chaste 
0	but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him 
0	he in the worst sense construes their denial 
0	the doors the wind the glove that did delay him 
0	he takes for accidental things of trial 
0	or as those bars which stop the hourly dial 
0	who with a lingering stay his course doth let 
0	till every minute pays the hour his debt 
0	 so so quoth he these lets attend the time 
0	like little frosts that sometime threat the spring 
0	to add a more rejoicing to the prime 
0	and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing 
0	pain pays the income of each precious thing 
0	huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves and sands 
0	the merchant fears ere rich at home he lands 
0	now is he come unto the chamber door 
0	that shuts him from the heaven of his thought 
0	which with a yielding latch and with no more 
0	hath barr d him from the blessed thing he sought 
0	so from himself impiety hath wrought 
0	that for his prey to pray he doth begin 
0	as if the heavens should countenance his sin 
0	but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer 
0	having solicited th eternal power
0	that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
0	and they would stand auspicious to the hour 
0	even there he starts quoth he i must de flower 
0	the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact 
0	how can they then assist me in the act 
0	 then love and fortune be my gods my guide 
0	my will is back d with resolution 
0	thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried 
0	the blackest sin is clear d with absolution 
0	against love s fire fear s frost hath dissolution 
0	the eye of heaven is out and misty night
0	covers the shame that follows sweet delight 
0	this said his guilty hand pluck d up the latch 
0	and with his knee the door he opens wide 
0	the dove sleeps fast that this night owl will catch 
0	thus treason works ere traitors be espied 
0	who sees the lurking serpent steps aside 
0	but she sound sleeping fearing no such thing 
0	lies at the mercy of his mortal sting 
0	into the chamber wickedly he stalks 
0	and gazeth on her yet unstained bed 
0	the curtains being close about he walks 
0	rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head 
0	by their high treason is his heart misled 
0	which gives the watch word to his hand full soon
0	to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon 
0	look as the fair and fiery pointed sun 
0	rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight 
0	even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun
0	to wink being blinded with a greater light 
0	whether it is that she reflects so bright 
0	that dazzleth them or else some shame supposed 
0	but blind they are and keep themselves enclosed 
0	o had they in that darksome prison died 
0	then had they seen the period of their ill 
0	then collatine again by lucrece side 
0	in his clear bed might have reposed still 
0	but they must ope this blessed league to kill 
0	and holy thoughted lucrece to their sight
0	must sell her joy her life her world s delight 
0	her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under 
0	cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss 
0	who therefore angry seems to part in sunder 
0	swelling on either side to want his bliss 
0	between whose hills her head entombed is 
0	where like a virtuous monument she lies 
0	to be admired of lewd unhallow d eyes 
0	without the bed her other fair hand was 
0	on the green coverlet whose perfect white
0	show d like an april daisy on the grass 
0	with pearly sweat resembling dew of night 
0	her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light 
0	and canopied in darkness sweetly lay 
0	till they might open to adorn the day 
0	her hair like golden threads play d with her breath 
0	o modest wantons wanton modesty 
0	showing life s triumph in the map of death 
0	and death s dim look in life s mortality 
0	each in her sleep themselves so beautify 
0	as if between them twain there were no strife 
0	but that life lived in death and death in life 
0	her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue 
0	a pair of maiden worlds unconquered 
0	save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew 
0	and him by oath they truly honoured 
0	these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred 
0	who like a foul usurper went about
0	from this fair throne to heave the owner out 
0	what could he see but mightily he noted 
0	what did he note but strongly he desired 
0	what he beheld on that he firmly doted 
0	and in his will his wilful eye he tired 
0	with more than admiration he admired
0	her azure veins her alabaster skin 
0	her coral lips her snow white dimpled chin 
0	as the grim lion fawneth o er his prey 
0	sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied 
0	so o er this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay 
0	his rage of lust by grazing qualified 
0	slack d not suppress d for standing by her side 
0	his eye which late this mutiny restrains 
0	unto a greater uproar tempts his veins 
0	and they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting 
0	obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting 
0	in bloody death and ravishment delighting 
0	nor children s tears nor mothers groans respecting 
0	swell in their pride the onset still expecting 
0	anon his beating heart alarum striking 
0	gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking 
0	his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye 
0	his eye commends the leading to his hand 
0	his hand as proud of such a dignity 
0	smoking with pride march d on to make his stand
0	on her bare breast the heart of all her land 
0	whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale 
0	left their round turrets destitute and pale 
0	they mustering to the quiet cabinet
0	where their dear governess and lady lies 
0	do tell her she is dreadfully beset 
0	and fright her with confusion of their cries 
0	she much amazed breaks ope her lock d up eyes 
0	who peeping forth this tumult to behold 
0	are by his flaming torch dimm d and controll d 
0	imagine her as one in dead of night
0	from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking 
0	that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite 
0	whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking 
0	what terror tis but she in worser taking 
0	from sleep disturbed heedfully doth view
0	the sight which makes supposed terror true 
0	wrapp d and confounded in a thousand fears 
0	like to a new kill d bird she trembling lies 
0	she dares not look yet winking there appears
0	quick shifting antics ugly in her eyes 
0	such shadows are the weak brain s forgeries 
0	who angry that the eyes fly from their lights 
0	in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights 
0	his hand that yet remains upon her breast 
0	rude ram to batter such an ivory wall 
0	may feel her heart poor citizen distress d 
0	wounding itself to death rise up and fall 
0	beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal 
0	this moves in him more rage and lesser pity 
0	to make the breach and enter this sweet city 
0	first like a trumpet doth his tongue begin
0	to sound a parley to his heartless foe 
0	who o er the white sheet peers her whiter chin 
0	the reason of this rash alarm to know 
0	but she with vehement prayers urgeth still
0	under what colour he commits this ill 
0	thus he replies the colour in thy face 
0	that even for anger makes the lily pale 
0	and the red rose blush at her own disgrace 
0	shall plead for me and tell my loving tale 
0	under that colour am i come to scale
0	thy never conquer d fort the fault is thine 
0	for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine 
0	 thus i forestall thee if thou mean to chide 
0	thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night 
0	where thou with patience must my will abide 
0	my will that marks thee for my earth s delight 
0	which i to conquer sought with all my might 
0	but as reproof and reason beat it dead 
0	by thy bright beauty was it newly bred 
0	 i see what crosses my attempt will bring 
0	i know what thorns the growing rose defends 
0	i think the honey guarded with a sting 
0	all this beforehand counsel comprehends 
0	but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends 
0	only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty 
0	and dotes on what he looks gainst law or duty 
0	 i have debated even in my soul 
0	what wrong what shame what sorrow i shall breed 
0	but nothing can affection s course control 
0	or stop the headlong fury of his speed 
0	i know repentant tears ensue the deed 
0	reproach disdain and deadly enmity 
0	yet strike i to embrace mine infamy 
0	this said he shakes aloft his roman blade 
0	which like a falcon towering in the skies 
0	coucheth the fowl below with his wings shade 
0	whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies 
0	so under his insulting falchion lies
0	harmless lucretia marking what he tells
0	with trembling fear as fowl hear falcon s bells 
0	 lucrece quoth he this night i must enjoy thee 
0	if thou deny then force must work my way 
0	for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee 
0	that done some worthless slave of thine i ll slay 
0	to kill thine honour with thy life s decay 
0	and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him 
0	swearing i slew him seeing thee embrace him 
0	 so thy surviving husband shall remain
0	the scornful mark of every open eye 
0	thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain 
0	and thou the author of their obloquy 
0	shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes 
0	and sung by children in succeeding times 
0	 but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend 
0	the fault unknown is as a thought unacted 
0	a little harm done to a great good end
0	for lawful policy remains enacted 
0	the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
0	in a pure compound being so applied 
0	his venom in effect is purified 
0	 then for thy husband and thy children s sake 
0	tender my suit bequeath not to their lot
0	the shame that from them no device can take 
0	the blemish that will never be forgot 
0	worse than a slavish wipe or birth hour s blot 
0	for marks descried in men s nativity
0	are nature s faults not their own infamy 
0	here with a cockatrice s dead killing eye
0	he rouseth up himself and makes a pause 
0	while she the picture of pure piety 
0	like a white hind under the gripe s sharp claws 
0	pleads in a wilderness where are no laws 
0	to the rough beast that knows no gentle right 
0	nor aught obeys but his foul appetite 
0	but when a black faced cloud the world doth threat 
0	in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding 
0	from earth s dark womb some gentle gust doth get 
0	which blows these pitchy vapours from their biding 
0	hindering their present fall by this dividing 
0	so his unhallow d haste her words delays 
0	and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays 
0	yet foul night working cat he doth but dally 
0	while in his hold fast foot the weak mouse panteth 
0	her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly 
0	a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth 
0	his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth
0	no penetrable entrance to her plaining 
0	tears harden lust though marble wear with raining 
0	her pity pleading eyes are sadly fixed
0	in the remorseless wrinkles of his face 
0	her modest eloquence with sighs is mixed 
0	which to her oratory adds more grace 
0	she puts the period often from his place 
0	and midst the sentence so her accent breaks 
0	that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks 
0	she conjures him by high almighty jove 
0	by knighthood gentry and sweet friendship s oath 
0	by her untimely tears her husband s love 
0	by holy human law and common troth 
0	by heaven and earth and all the power of both 
0	that to his borrow d bed he make retire 
0	and stoop to honour not to foul desire 
0	quoth she reward not hospitality
0	with such black payment as thou hast pretended 
0	mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee 
0	mar not the thing that cannot be amended 
0	end thy ill aim before the shoot be ended 
0	he is no woodman that doth bend his bow
0	to strike a poor unseasonable doe 
0	 my husband is thy friend for his sake spare me 
0	thyself art mighty for thine own sake leave me 
0	myself a weakling do not then ensnare me 
0	thou look st not like deceit do not deceive me 
0	my sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee 
0	if ever man were moved with woman s moans 
0	be moved with my tears my sighs my groans 
0	 all which together like a troubled ocean 
0	beat at thy rocky and wreck threatening heart 
0	to soften it with their continual motion 
0	for stones dissolved to water do convert 
0	o if no harder than a stone thou art 
0	melt at my tears and be compassionate 
0	soft pity enters at an iron gate 
0	 in tarquin s likeness i did entertain thee 
0	hast thou put on his shape to do him shame 
0	to all the host of heaven i complain me 
0	thou wrong st his honour wound st his princely name 
0	thou art not what thou seem st and if the same 
0	thou seem st not what thou art a god a king 
0	for kings like gods should govern every thing 
0	 how will thy shame be seeded in thine age 
0	when thus thy vices bud before thy spring 
0	if in thy hope thou darest do such outrage 
0	what darest thou not when once thou art a king 
0	o be remember d no outrageous thing
0	from vassal actors can he wiped away 
0	then kings misdeeds cannot be hid in clay 
0	 this deed will make thee only loved for fear 
0	but happy monarchs still are fear d for love 
0	with foul offenders thou perforce must bear 
0	when they in thee the like offences prove 
0	if but for fear of this thy will remove 
0	for princes are the glass the school the book 
0	where subjects eyes do learn do read do look 
0	 and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn 
0	must he in thee read lectures of such shame 
0	wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
0	authority for sin warrant for blame 
0	to privilege dishonour in thy name 
0	thou back st reproach against long living laud 
0	and makest fair reputation but a bawd 
0	 hast thou command by him that gave it thee 
0	from a pure heart command thy rebel will 
0	draw not thy sword to guard iniquity 
0	for it was lent thee all that brood to kill 
0	thy princely office how canst thou fulfill 
0	when pattern d by thy fault foul sin may say
0	he learn d to sin and thou didst teach the way 
0	 think but how vile a spectacle it were 
0	to view thy present trespass in another 
0	men s faults do seldom to themselves appear 
0	their own transgressions partially they smother 
0	this guilt would seem death worthy in thy brother 
0	o how are they wrapp d in with infamies
0	that from their own misdeeds askance their eyes 
0	 to thee to thee my heaved up hands appeal 
0	not to seducing lust thy rash relier 
0	i sue for exiled majesty s repeal 
0	let him return and flattering thoughts retire 
0	his true respect will prison false desire

0	that done despitefully i mean to bear thee
0	unto the base bed of some rascal groom 
0	to be thy partner in this shameful doom 
0	this said he sets his foot upon the light 
0	for light and lust are deadly enemies 
0	shame folded up in blind concealing night

0	and therefore would they still in darkness be 
0	to have their unseen sin remain untold 
0	for they their guilt with weeping will unfold 
0	and grave like water that doth eat in steel 
0	upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel 
0	here she exclaims against repose and rest

0	why pry st thou through my window leave thy peeping

0	thus cavils she with every thing she sees

0	old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild 
0	continuance tames the one the other wild

0	sad souls are slain in merry company 
0	grief best is pleased with grief s society

0	to keep thy sharp woes waking wretched i 
0	to imitate thee well against my heart
0	will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye

0	some dark deep desert seated room the way 
0	that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold 
0	will we find out and there we will unfold
0	to creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds

0	as the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze

0	with untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid
0	whose swift obedience to her mistress hies

0	no cause but company of her drops spilling 
0	their gentle sex to weep are often willing

0	conceit and grief an eager combat fight 
0	what wit sets down is blotted straight with will 
0	this is too curious good this blunt and ill 
0	much like a press of people at a door 
0	throng her inventions which shall go before

0	of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee 
0	health to thy person next vouchsafe t afford 
0	of ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see 
0	some present speed to come and visit me 
0	so i commend me from our house in grief 
0	my woes are tedious though my words are brief 
0	here folds she up the tenour of her woe 
0	her certain sorrow writ uncertainly 
0	by this short schedule collatine may know
0	her grief but not her grief s true quality 
0	she dares not thereof make discovery 
0	lest he should hold it her own gross abuse 
0	ere she with blood had stain d her stain d excuse 
0	besides the life and feeling of her passion
0	she hoards to spend when he is by to hear her 
0	when sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
0	of her disgrace the better so to clear her
0	from that suspicion which the world my might bear her 
0	to shun this blot she would not blot the letter
0	with words till action might become them better 
0	to see sad sights moves more than hear them told 
0	for then the eye interprets to the ear
0	the heavy motion that it doth behold 
0	when every part a part of woe doth bear 
0	 tis but a part of sorrow that we hear 
0	deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords 
0	and sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words 
0	her letter now is seal d and on it writ
0	 at ardea to my lord with more than haste 
0	the post attends and she delivers it 
0	charging the sour faced groom to hie as fast
0	as lagging fowls before the northern blast 
0	speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems 
0	extremely still urgeth such extremes 
0	the homely villain court sies to her low 
0	and blushing on her with a steadfast eye
0	receives the scroll without or yea or no
0	and forth with bashful innocence doth hie 
0	but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
0	imagine every eye beholds their blame 
0	for lucrece thought he blush d to see her shame 
0	when silly groom god wot it was defect
0	of spirit life and bold audacity 
0	such harmless creatures have a true respect
0	to talk in deeds while others saucily
0	promise more speed but do it leisurely 
0	even so this pattern of the worn out age
0	pawn d honest looks but laid no words to gage 
0	his kindled duty kindled her mistrust 
0	that two red fires in both their faces blazed 
0	she thought he blushed as knowing tarquin s lust 
0	and blushing with him wistly on him gazed 
0	her earnest eye did make him more amazed 
0	the more saw the blood his cheeks replenish 
0	the more she thought he spied in her some blemish 
0	but long she thinks till he return again 
0	and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone 
0	the weary time she cannot entertain 
0	for now tis stale to sigh to weep to groan 
0	so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan 
0	that she her plaints a little while doth stay 
0	pausing for means to mourn some newer way 
0	at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
0	of skilful painting made for priam s troy 
0	before the which is drawn the power of greece 
0	for helen s rape the city to destroy 
0	threatening cloud kissing ilion with annoy 
0	which the conceited painter drew so proud 
0	as heaven it seem d to kiss the turrets bow d 
0	a thousand lamentable objects there 
0	in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life 
0	many a dry drop seem d a weeping tear 
0	shed for the slaughter d husband by the wife 
0	the red blood reek d to show the painter s strife 
0	the dying eyes gleam d forth their ashy lights 
0	like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights 
0	there might you see the labouring pioner
0	begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust 
0	and from the towers of troy there would appear
0	the very eyes of men through loop holes thrust 
0	gazing upon the greeks with little lust 
0	such sweet observance in this work was had 
0	that one might see those far off eyes look sad 
0	in great commanders grace and majesty
0	you might behold triumphing in their faces 
0	in youth quick bearing and dexterity 
0	and here and there the painter interlaces
0	pale cowards marching on with trembling paces 
0	which heartless peasants did so well resemble 
0	that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble 
0	in ajax and ulysses o what art
0	of physiognomy might one behold 
0	the face of either cipher d either s heart 
0	their face their manners most expressly told 
0	in ajax eyes blunt rage and rigour roll d 
0	but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent
0	show d deep regard and smiling government 
0	there pleading might you see grave nestor stand 
0	as twere encouraging the greeks to fight 
0	making such sober action with his hand 
0	that it beguiled attention charm d the sight 
0	in speech it seem d his beard all silver white 
0	wagg d up and down and from his lips did fly
0	thin winding breath which curl d up to the sky 
0	about him were a press of gaping faces 
0	which seem d to swallow up his sound advice 
0	all jointly listening but with several graces 
0	as if some mermaid did their ears entice 
0	some high some low the painter was so nice 
0	the scalps of many almost hid behind 
0	to jump up higher seem d to mock the mind 
0	here one man s hand lean d on another s head 
0	his nose being shadow d by his neighbour s ear 
0	here one being throng d bears back all boll n and red 
0	another smother d seems to pelt and swear 
0	and in their rage such signs of rage they bear 
0	as but for loss of nestor s golden words 
0	it seem d they would debate with angry swords 
0	for much imaginary work was there 
0	conceit deceitful so compact so kind 
0	that for achilles image stood his spear 
0	griped in an armed hand himself behind 
0	was left unseen save to the eye of mind 
0	a hand a foot a face a leg a head 
0	stood for the whole to be imagined 
0	and from the walls of strong besieged troy
0	when their brave hope bold hector march d to field 
0	stood many trojan mothers sharing joy
0	to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield 
0	and to their hope they such odd action yield 
0	that through their light joy seemed to appear 
0	like bright things stain d a kind of heavy fear 
0	and from the strand of dardan where they fought 
0	to simois reedy banks the red blood ran 
0	whose waves to imitate the battle sought
0	with swelling ridges and their ranks began
0	to break upon the galled shore and than
0	retire again till meeting greater ranks 
0	they join and shoot their foam at simois banks 
0	to this well painted piece is lucrece come 
0	to find a face where all distress is stell d 
0	many she sees where cares have carved some 
0	but none where all distress and dolour dwell d 
0	till she despairing hecuba beheld 
0	staring on priam s wounds with her old eyes 
0	which bleeding under pyrrhus proud foot lies 
0	in her the painter had anatomized
0	time s ruin beauty s wreck and grim cares reign 
0	her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguised 
0	of what she was no semblance did remain 
0	her blue blood changed to black in every vein 
0	wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed 
0	show d life imprison d in a body dead 
0	on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes 
0	and shapes her sorrow to the bedlam s woes 
0	who nothing wants to answer her but cries 
0	and bitter words to ban her cruel foes 
0	the painter was no god to lend her those 
0	and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong 
0	to give her so much grief and not a tongue 
0	 poor instrument quoth she without a sound 
0	i ll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue 
0	and drop sweet balm in priam s painted wound 
0	and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong 
0	and with my tears quench troy that burns so long 
0	and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
0	of all the greeks that are thine enemies 
0	 show me the strumpet that began this stir 
0	that with my nails her beauty i may tear 
0	thy heat of lust fond paris did incur
0	this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear 
0	thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here 
0	and here in troy for trespass of thine eye 
0	the sire the son the dame and daughter die 
0	 why should the private pleasure of some one
0	become the public plague of many moe 
0	let sin alone committed light alone
0	upon his head that hath transgressed so 
0	let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe 
0	for one s offence why should so many fall 
0	to plague a private sin in general 
0	 lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies 
0	here manly hector faints here troilus swounds 
0	here friend by friend in bloody channel lies 
0	and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds 
0	and one man s lust these many lives confounds 
0	had doting priam check d his son s desire 
0	troy had been bright with fame and not with fire 
0	here feelingly she weeps troy s painted woes 
0	for sorrow like a heavy hanging bell 
0	once set on ringing with his own weight goes 
0	then little strength rings out the doleful knell 
0	so lucrece set a work sad tales doth tell
0	to pencill d pensiveness and colour d sorrow 
0	she lends them words and she their looks doth borrow 
0	she throws her eyes about the painting round 
0	and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament 
0	at last she sees a wretched image bound 
0	that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent 
0	his face though full of cares yet show d content 
0	onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes 
0	so mild that patience seem d to scorn his woes 
0	in him the painter labour d with his skill
0	to hide deceit and give the harmless show
0	an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still 
0	a brow unbent that seem d to welcome woe 
0	cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so
0	that blushing red no guilty instance gave 
0	nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have 
0	but like a constant and confirmed devil 
0	he entertain d a show so seeming just 
0	and therein so ensconced his secret evil 
0	that jealousy itself cold not mistrust
0	false creeping craft and perjury should thrust
0	into so bright a day such black faced storms 
0	or blot with hell born sin such saint like forms 
0	the well skill d workman this mild image drew
0	for perjured sinon whose enchanting story
0	the credulous old priam after slew 
0	whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
0	of rich built ilion that the skies were sorry 
0	and little stars shot from their fixed places 
0	when their glass fell wherein they view d their faces 
0	this picture she advisedly perused 
0	and chid the painter for his wondrous skill 
0	saying some shape in sinon s was abused 
0	so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill 
0	and still on him she gazed and gazing still 
0	such signs of truth in his plain face she spied 
0	that she concludes the picture was belied 
0	 it cannot be quoth she that so much guile 
0	she would have said can lurk in such a look 
0	but tarquin s shape came in her mind the while 
0	and from her tongue can lurk from cannot took 
0	 it cannot be she in that sense forsook 
0	and turn d it thus it cannot be i find 
0	but such a face should bear a wicked mind 
0	 for even as subtle sinon here is painted 
0	so sober sad so weary and so mild 
0	as if with grief or travail he had fainted 
0	to me came tarquin armed so beguiled
0	with outward honesty but yet defiled
0	with inward vice as priam him did cherish 
0	so did i tarquin so my troy did perish 
0	 look look how listening priam wets his eyes 
0	to see those borrow d tears that sinon sheds 
0	priam why art thou old and yet not wise 
0	for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds 
0	his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds 
0	those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity 
0	are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city 
0	 such devils steal effects from lightless hell 
0	for sinon in his fire doth quake with cold 
0	and in that cold hot burning fire doth dwell 
0	these contraries such unity do hold 
0	only to flatter fools and make them bold 
0	so priam s trust false sinon s tears doth flatter 
0	that he finds means to burn his troy with water 
0	here all enraged such passion her assails 
0	that patience is quite beaten from her breast 
0	she tears the senseless sinon with her nails 
0	comparing him to that unhappy guest
0	whose deed hath made herself herself detest 
0	at last she smilingly with this gives o er 
0	 fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore 
0	thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow 
0	and time doth weary time with her complaining 
0	she looks for night and then she longs for morrow 
0	and both she thinks too long with her remaining 
0	short time seems long in sorrow s sharp sustaining 
0	though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps 
0	and they that watch see time how slow it creeps 
0	which all this time hath overslipp d her thought 
0	that she with painted images hath spent 
0	being from the feeling of her own grief brought
0	by deep surmise of others detriment 
0	losing her woes in shows of discontent 
0	it easeth some though none it ever cured 
0	to think their dolour others have endured 
0	but now the mindful messenger come back 
0	brings home his lord and other company 
0	who finds his lucrece clad in mourning black 
0	and round about her tear distained eye
0	blue circles stream d like rainbows in the sky 
0	these water galls in her dim element
0	foretell new storms to those already spent 
0	which when her sad beholding husband saw 
0	amazedly in her sad face he stares 
0	her eyes though sod in tears look d red and raw 
0	her lively colour kill d with deadly cares 
0	he hath no power to ask her how she fares 
0	both stood like old acquaintance in a trance 
0	met far from home wondering each other s chance 
0	at last he takes her by the bloodless hand 
0	and thus begins what uncouth ill event
0	hath thee befall n that thou dost trembling stand 
0	sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent 
0	why art thou thus attired in discontent 
0	unmask dear dear this moody heaviness 
0	and tell thy grief that we may give redress 
0	three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire 
0	ere once she can discharge one word of woe 
0	at length address d to answer his desire 
0	she modestly prepares to let them know
0	her honour is ta en prisoner by the foe 
0	while collatine and his consorted lords
0	with sad attention long to hear her words 
0	and now this pale swan in her watery nest
0	begins the sad dirge of her certain ending 
0	 few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best 
0	where no excuse can give the fault amending 
0	in me moe woes than words are now depending 
0	and my laments would be drawn out too long 
0	to tell them all with one poor tired tongue 
0	 then be this all the task it hath to say 
0	dear husband in the interest of thy bed
0	a stranger came and on that pillow lay
0	where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head 
0	and what wrong else may be imagined
0	by foul enforcement might be done to me 
0	from that alas thy lucrece is not free 
0	 for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight 
0	with shining falchion in my chamber came
0	a creeping creature with a flaming light 
0	and softly cried awake thou roman dame 
0	and entertain my love else lasting shame
0	on thee and thine this night i will inflict 
0	if thou my love s desire do contradict 
0	 for some hard favour d groom of thine quoth he 
0	 unless thou yoke thy liking to my will 
0	i ll murder straight and then i ll slaughter thee
0	and swear i found you where you did fulfil
0	the loathsome act of lust and so did kill
0	the lechers in their deed this act will be
0	my fame and thy perpetual infamy 
0	 with this i did begin to start and cry 
0	and then against my heart he sets his sword 
0	swearing unless i took all patiently 
0	i should not live to speak another word 
0	so should my shame still rest upon record 
0	and never be forgot in mighty rome
0	th adulterate death of lucrece and her groom 
0	mine enemy was strong my poor self weak 
0	and far the weaker with so strong a fear 
0	my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak 
0	no rightful plea might plead for justice there 
0	his scarlet lust came evidence to swear
0	that my poor beauty had purloin d his eyes 
0	and when the judge is robb d the prisoner dies 
0	 o teach me how to make mine own excuse 
0	or at the least this refuge let me find 
0	though my gross blood be stain d with this abuse 
0	immaculate and spotless is my mind 
0	that was not forced that never was inclined
0	to accessary yieldings but still pure
0	doth in her poison d closet yet endure 
0	lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss 
0	with head declined and voice damm d up with woe 
0	with sad set eyes and wretched arms across 
0	from lips new waxen pale begins to blow
0	the grief away that stops his answer so 
0	but wretched as he is he strives in vain 
0	what he breathes out his breath drinks up again 
0	as through an arch the violent roaring tide
0	outruns the eye that doth behold his haste 
0	yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
0	back to the strait that forced him on so fast 
0	in rage sent out recall d in rage being past 
0	even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw 
0	to push grief on and back the same grief draw 
0	which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth 
0	and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh 
0	 dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
0	another power no flood by raining slaketh 
0	my woe too sensible thy passion maketh
0	more feeling painful let it then suffice
0	to drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes 
0	 and for my sake when i might charm thee so
0	for she that was thy lucrece now attend me 
0	be suddenly revenged on my foe 
0	thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me
0	from what is past the help that thou shalt lend me
0	comes all too late yet let the traitor die 
0	for sparing justice feeds iniquity 
0	 but ere i name him you fair lords quoth she 
0	speaking to those that came with collatine 
0	 shall plight your honourable faiths to me 
0	with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine 
0	for tis a meritorious fair design
0	to chase injustice with revengeful arms 
0	knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms 
0	at this request with noble disposition
0	each present lord began to promise aid 
0	as bound in knighthood to her imposition 
0	longing to hear the hateful foe bewray d 
0	but she that yet her sad task hath not said 
0	the protestation stops o speak quoth she 
0	 how may this forced stain be wiped from me 
0	 what is the quality of mine offence 
0	being constrain d with dreadful circumstance 
0	may my pure mind with the foul act dispense 
0	my low declined honour to advance 
0	may any terms acquit me from this chance 
0	the poison d fountain clears itself again 
0	and why not i from this compelled stain 
0	with this they all at once began to say 
0	her body s stain her mind untainted clears 
0	while with a joyless smile she turns away
0	the face that map which deep impression bears
0	of hard misfortune carved in it with tears 
0	 no no quoth she no dame hereafter living 
0	by my excuse shall claim excuses giving 
0	here with a sigh as if her heart would break 
0	she throws forth tarquin s name he he she says 
0	but more than he her poor tongue could not speak 
0	till after many accents and delays 
0	untimely breathings sick and short assays 
0	she utters this he he fair lords tis he 
0	that guides this hand to give this wound to me 
0	even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
0	a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed 
0	that blow did bail it from the deep unrest
0	of that polluted prison where it breathed 
0	her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed
0	her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly
0	life s lasting date from cancell d destiny 
0	stone still astonish d with this deadly deed 
0	stood collatine and all his lordly crew 
0	till lucrece father that beholds her bleed 
0	himself on her self slaughter d body threw 
0	and from the purple fountain brutus drew
0	the murderous knife and as it left the place 
0	her blood in poor revenge held it in chase 
0	and bubbling from her breast it doth divide
0	in two slow rivers that the crimson blood
0	circles her body in on every side 
0	who like a late sack d island vastly stood
0	bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood 
0	some of her blood still pure and red remain d 
0	and some look d black and that false tarquin stain d 
0	about the mourning and congealed face
0	of that black blood a watery rigol goes 
0	which seems to weep upon the tainted place 
0	and ever since as pitying lucrece woes 
0	corrupted blood some watery token shows 
0	and blood untainted still doth red abide 
0	blushing at that which is so putrified 
0	 daughter dear daughter old lucretius cries 
0	 that life was mine which thou hast here deprived 
0	if in the child the father s image lies 
0	where shall i live now lucrece is unlived 
0	thou wast not to this end from me derived
0	if children pre decease progenitors 
0	we are their offspring and they none of ours 
0	 poor broken glass i often did behold
0	in thy sweet semblance my old age new born 
0	but now that fair fresh mirror dim and old 
0	shows me a bare boned death by time outworn 
0	o from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn 
0	and shiver d all the beauty of my glass 
0	that i no more can see what once i was 
0	 o time cease thou thy course and last no longer 
0	if they surcease to be that should survive 
0	shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
0	and leave the faltering feeble souls alive

0	then live sweet lucrece live again and see
0	thy father die and not thy father thee 
0	by this starts collatine as from a dream 
0	and bids lucretius give his sorrow place 
0	and then in key cold lucrece bleeding stream
0	he falls and bathes the pale fear in his face 
0	and counterfeits to die with her a space 
0	till manly shame bids him possess his breath
0	and live to be revenged on her death 
0	the deep vexation of his inward soul
0	who mad that sorrow should his use control 
0	or keep him from heart easing words so long 
0	begins to talk but through his lips do throng
0	weak words so thick come in his poor heart s aid 
0	that no man could distinguish what he said 
0	yet sometime tarquin was pronounced plain 
0	but through his teeth as if the name he tore 
0	this windy tempest till it blow up rain 
0	held back his sorrow s tide to make it more 
0	at last it rains and busy winds give o er 
0	then son and father weep with equal strife

0	the one doth call her his the other his 
0	yet neither may possess the claim they lay 
0	the father says she s mine o mine she is 
0	replies her husband do not take away
0	my sorrow s interest let no mourner say
0	he weeps for her for she was only mine 
0	and only must be wail d by collatine 
0	 o quoth lucretius i did give that life
0	which she too early and too late hath spill d 
0	 woe woe quoth collatine she was my wife 
0	i owed her and tis mine that she hath kill d 
0	 my daughter and my wife with clamours fill d
0	the dispersed air who holding lucrece life 
0	answer d their cries my daughter and my wife 
0	brutus who pluck d the knife from lucrece side 
0	seeing such emulation in their woe 
0	began to clothe his wit in state and pride 
0	burying in lucrece wound his folly s show 
0	he with the romans was esteemed so
0	for sportive words and uttering foolish things 
0	but now he throws that shallow habit by 
0	wherein deep policy did him disguise 
0	and arm d his long hid wits advisedly 
0	to check the tears in collatinus eyes 
0	 thou wronged lord of rome quoth he arise 
0	let my unsounded self supposed a fool 
0	now set thy long experienced wit to school 
0	 why collatine is woe the cure for woe 
0	do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds 
0	is it revenge to give thyself a blow
0	for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds 
0	such childish humour from weak minds proceeds 
0	thy wretched wife mistook the matter so 
0	to slay herself that should have slain her foe 
0	 courageous roman do not steep thy heart
0	in such relenting dew of lamentations 
0	but kneel with me and help to bear thy part 
0	to rouse our roman gods with invocations 
0	that they will suffer these abominations 
0	since rome herself in them doth stand disgraced 
0	by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased 
0	 now by the capitol that we adore 
0	and by this chaste blood so unjustly stain d 
0	by heaven s fair sun that breeds the fat earth s store

0	and by chaste lucrece soul that late complain d
0	her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife 
0	we will revenge the death of this true wife 
0	this said he struck his hand upon his breast 
0	and kiss d the fatal knife to end his vow 
0	and to his protestation urged the rest 
0	who wondering at him did his words allow 
0	then jointly to the ground their knees they bow 
0	and that deep vow which brutus made before 
0	he doth again repeat and that they swore 
0	when they had sworn to this advised doom 
0	they did conclude to bear dead lucrece thence 
0	to show her bleeding body thorough rome 
0	and so to publish tarquin s foul offence 
0	which being done with speedy diligence 
0	the romans plausibly did give consent

0	sextus tarquinius the king s son in their discourses after
0	supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife among
0	whom collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife
0	lucretia in that pleasant humour they all posted to rome and
0	intending by their secret and sudden arrival to make trial of
0	that which every one had before avouched only collatinus finds
0	his wife though it were late in the night spinning amongst her
0	maids the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling or
0	in several disports whereupon the noblemen yielded collatinus
0	the victory and his wife the fame at that time sextus
0	tarquinius being inflamed with lucrece s beauty yet smothering
0	his passions for the present departed with the rest back to the
0	camp from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself and
0	was according to his estate royally entertained and lodged by
0	lucrece at collatium the same night he treacherously stealeth
0	into her chamber violently ravished her and early in the
0	morning speedeth away lucrece in this lamentable plight 
0	hastily dispatched messengers one to rome for her father 
0	another to the camp for collatine they came the one
0	accompanied with junius brutus the other with publius valerius 
0	and finding lucrece attired in mourning habit demanded the cause
0	revenge revealed the actor and whole manner of his dealing and
0	they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the
0	tarquins and bearing the dead body to rome brutus acquainted
0	the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed with a
0	bitter invective against the tyranny of the king wherewith the
0	people were so moved that with one consent and a general
0	acclamation the tarquins were all exiled and the state
0	government changed from kings to consuls 
0	from the besieged ardea all in post 
0	borne by the trustless wings of false desire 
0	lust breathed tarquin leaves the roman host 
0	and to collatium bears the lightless fire
0	which in pale embers hid lurks to aspire
0	and girdle with embracing flames the waist
0	of collatine s fair love lucrece the chaste 
0	haply that name of chaste unhapp ly set
0	this bateless edge on his keen appetite 
0	when collatine unwisely did not let
0	to praise the clear unmatched red and white
0	which triumph d in that sky of his delight 
0	where mortal stars as bright as heaven s beauties 
0	with pure aspects did him peculiar duties 
0	for he the night before in tarquin s tent 
0	unlock d the treasure of his happy state 
0	what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
0	in the possession of his beauteous mate 
0	reckoning his fortune at such high proud rate 
0	that kings might be espoused to more fame 
0	but king nor peer to such a peerless dame 
0	o happiness enjoy d but of a few 
0	and if possess d as soon decay d and done
0	as is the morning s silver melting dew
0	against the golden splendour of the sun 
0	an expir d date cancell d ere well begun 
0	honour and beauty in the owner s arms 
0	are weakly fortress d from a world of harms 
0	beauty itself doth of itself persuade
0	the eyes of men without an orator 
0	what needeth then apologies be made 
0	to set forth that which is so singular 
0	or why is collatine the publisher
0	from thievish ears because it is his own 
0	perchance his boast of lucrece sovereignty
0	suggested this proud issue of a king 
0	for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be 
0	perchance that envy of so rich a thing 
0	braving compare disdainfully did sting
0	his high pitch d thoughts that meaner men should vaunt
0	that golden hap which their superiors want 
0	but some untimely thought did instigate
0	his all too timeless speed if none of those 
0	his honour his affairs his friends his state 
0	neglected all with swift intent he goes
0	to quench the coal which in his liver glows 
0	o rash false heat wrapp d in repentant cold 
0	thy hasty spring still blasts and ne er grows old 
0	when at collatium this false lord arriv d 
0	well was he welcom d by the roman dame 
0	within whose face beauty and virtue striv d
0	which of them both should underprop her fame 
0	when virtue bragg d beauty would blush for shame 
0	when beauty boasted blushes in despite
0	virtue would stain that or with silver white 
0	but beauty in that white intituled 
0	from venus doves doth challenge that fair field 
0	then virtue claims from beauty beauty s red 
0	which virtue gave the golden age to gild
0	their silver cheeks and call d it then their shield 
0	teaching them thus to use it in the fight 
0	when shame assail d the red should fence the white 
0	this heraldry in lucrece face was seen 
0	argued by beauty s red and virtue s white 
0	of either s colour was the other queen 
0	proving from world s minority their right 
0	yet their ambition makes them still to fight 
0	the sovereignty of either being so great 
0	that oft they interchange each other s seat 
0	their silent war of lilies and of roses 
0	which tarquin view d in her fair face s field 
0	in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses 
0	where lest between them both it should be kill d 
0	the coward captive vanquish d doth yield
0	to those two armies that would let him go 
0	rather than triumph in so false a foe 
0	now thinks he that her husband s shallow tongue 
0	in that high task hath done her beauty wrong 
0	which far exceeds his barren skill to show 
0	therefore that praise which collatine doth owe
0	enchanted tarquin answers with surmise 
0	in silent wonder of still gazing eyes 
0	this earthly saint adored by this devil 
0	little suspecteth the false worshipper 
0	for unstain d thoughts do seldom dream on evil 
0	birds never lim d no secret bushes fear 
0	so guiltless she securely gives good cheer
0	and reverend welcome to her princely guest 
0	whose inward ill no outward harm express d 
0	for that he colour d with his high estate 
0	hiding base sin in plaits of majesty 
0	that nothing in him seem d inordinate 
0	save sometime too much wonder of his eye 
0	which having all all could not satisfy 
0	but poorly rich so wanteth in his store 
0	that cloy d with much he pineth still for more 
0	but she that never cop d with stranger eyes 
0	could pick no meaning from their parling looks 
0	nor read the subtle shining secrecies
0	writ in the glassy margents of such books 
0	she touch d no unknown baits nor fear d no hooks 
0	nor could she moralize his wanton sight 
0	more than his eyes were open d to the light 
0	he stories to her ears her husband s fame 
0	won in the fields of fruitful italy 
0	and decks with praises collatine s high name 
0	made glorious by his manly chivalry
0	with bruised arms and wreaths of victory 
0	her joy with heav d up hand she doth express 
0	and wordless so greets heaven for his success 
0	far from the purpose of his coming hither 
0	he makes excuses for his being there 
0	no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
0	doth yet in his fair welkin once appear 
0	till sable night mother of dread and fear 
0	upon the world dim darkness doth display 
0	and in her vaulty prison stows the day 
0	for then is tarquin brought unto his bed 
0	intending weariness with heavy spright 
0	for after supper long he questioned
0	with modest lucrece and wore out the night 
0	now leaden slumber with life s strength doth fight 
0	and every one to rest themselves betake 
0	save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake 
0	as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving
0	the sundry dangers of his will s obtaining 
0	yet ever to obtain his will resolving 
0	though weak built hopes persuade him to abstaining 
0	despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining 
0	and when great treasure is the meed propos d 
0	though death be adjunct there s no death suppos d 
0	those that much covet are with gain so fond 
0	for what they have not that which they possess
0	they scatter and unloose it from their bond 
0	and so by hoping more they have but less 
0	or gaining more the profit of excess
0	is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain 
0	that they prove bankrupt in this poor rich gain 
0	the aim of all is but to nurse the life
0	with honour wealth and ease in waning age 
0	and in this aim there is such thwarting strife 
0	that one for all or all for one we gage 
0	as life for honour in fell battles rage 
0	honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost
0	the death of all and all together lost 
0	so that in vent ring ill we leave to be
0	the things we are for that which we expect 
0	and this ambitious foul infirmity 
0	in having much torments us with defect
0	of that we have so then we do neglect
0	the thing we have and all for want of wit 
0	make something nothing by augmenting it 
0	such hazard now must doting tarquin make 
0	pawning his honour to obtain his lust 
0	and for himself himself he must forsake 
0	then where is truth if there be no self trust 
0	when shall he think to find a stranger just 
0	when he himself himself confounds betrays
0	to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days 
0	now stole upon the time the dead of night 
0	when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes 
0	no comfortable star did lend his light 
0	no noise but owls and wolves death boding cries 
0	now serves the season that they may surprise
0	the silly lambs pure thoughts are dead and still 
0	while lust and murder wake to stain and kill 
0	and now this lustful lord leap d from his bed 
0	throwing his mantle rudely o er his arm 
0	is madly toss d between desire and dread 
0	th one sweetly flatters th other feareth harm 
0	but honest fear bewitch d with lust s foul charm 
0	doth too too oft betake him to retire 
0	beaten away by brain sick rude desire 
0	his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth 
0	that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly 
0	whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth 
0	which must be lode star to his lustful eye 
0	and to the flame thus speaks advisedly 
0	 as from this cold flint i enforced this fire 
0	so lucrece must i force to my desire 
0	here pale with fear he doth premeditate
0	the dangers of his loathsome enterprise 
0	and in his inward mind he doth debate
0	what following sorrow may on this arise 
0	then looking scornfully he doth despise
0	his naked armour of still slaughter d lust 
0	and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust 
0	 fair torch burn out thy light and lend it not
0	to darken her whose light excelleth thine 
0	and die unhallow d thoughts before you blot
0	with your uncleanness that which is divine 
0	offer pure incense to so pure a shrine 
0	let fair humanity abhor the deed
0	that spots and stains love s modest snow white weed 
0	 o shame to knighthood and to shining arms 
0	o foul dishonour to my household s grave 
0	o impious act including all foul harms 
0	a martial man to be soft fancy s slave 
0	true valour still a true respect should have 
0	then my digression is so vile so base 
0	that it will live engraven in my face 
0	 yea though i die the scandal will survive 
0	and be an eye sore in my golden coat 
0	some loathsome dash the herald will contrive 
0	to cipher me how fondly i did dote 
0	that my posterity sham d with the note 
0	shall curse my bones and hold it for no sin
0	to wish that i their father had not been 
0	 what win i if i gain the thing i seek 
0	a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy 
0	who buys a minute s mirth to wail a week 
0	or sells eternity to get a toy 
0	for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy 
0	or what fond beggar but to touch the crown 
0	would with the sceptre straight be strucken down 
0	 if collatinus dream of my intent 
0	will he not wake and in a desperate rage
0	post hither this vile purpose to prevent 
0	this siege that hath engirt his marriage 
0	this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage 
0	this dying virtue this surviving shame 
0	whose crime will bear an ever during blame 
0	 o what excuse can my invention make
0	when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed 
0	will not my tongue be mute my frail joints shake 
0	mine eyes forego their light my false heart bleed 
0	the guilt being great the fear doth still exceed 
0	and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly 
0	but coward like with trembling terror die 
0	 had collatinus kill d my son or sire 
0	or lain in ambush to betray my life 
0	or were he not my dear friend this desire
0	might have excuse to work upon his wife 
0	as in revenge or quittal of such strife 
0	but as he is my kinsman my dear friend 
0	the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end 
0	 shameful it is ay if the fact be known 
0	hateful it is there is no hate in loving 
0	i ll beg her love but she is not her own 
0	the worst is but denial and reproving 
0	my will is strong past reason s weak removing 
0	who fears a sentence or an old man s saw
0	shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe 
0	thus graceless holds he disputation
0	 tween frozen conscience and hot burning will 
0	and with good thoughts makes dispensation 
0	urging the worser sense for vantage still 
0	which in a moment doth confound and kill
0	all pure effects and doth so far proceed 
0	that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed 
0	quoth he she took me kindly by the hand 
0	and gaz d for tidings in my eager eyes 
0	fearing some hard news from the warlike band 
0	where her beloved collatinus lies 
0	o how her fear did make her colour rise 
0	first red as roses that on lawn we lay 
0	then white as lawn the roses took away 
0	 and how her hand in my hand being lock d 
0	forc d it to tremble with her loyal fear 
0	which struck her sad and then it faster rock d 
0	until her husband s welfare she did hear 
0	whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer 
0	that had narcissus seen her as she stood 
0	self love had never drown d him in the flood 
0	 why hunt i then for colour or excuses 
0	poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses 
0	love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth 
0	affection is my captain and he leadeth 
0	and when his gaudy banner is display d 
0	the coward fights and will not be dismay d 
0	 then childish fear avaunt debating die 
0	respect and reason wait on wrinkled age 
0	my heart shall never countermand mine eye 
0	sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage 
0	my part is youth and beats these from the stage 
0	desire my pilot is beauty my prize 
0	then who fears sinking where such treasure lies 
0	as corn o ergrown by weeds so heedful fear
0	is almost chok d by unresisted lust 
0	away he steals with opening listening ear 
0	full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust 
0	both which as servitors to the unjust 
0	so cross him with their opposite persuasion 
0	that now he vows a league and now invasion 
0	within his thought her heavenly image sits 
0	and in the self same seat sits collatine 
0	that eye which looks on her confounds his wits 
0	that eye which him beholds as more divine 
0	unto a view so false will not incline 
0	but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart 
0	which once corrupted takes the worser part 
0	and therein heartens up his servile powers 
0	who flatter d by their leader s jocund show 
0	stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours 
0	and as their captain so their pride doth grow 
0	paying more slavish tribute than they owe 
0	by reprobate desire thus madly led 
0	the roman lord marcheth to lucrece bed 
0	the locks between her chamber and his will 
0	each one by him enforc d retires his ward 
0	but as they open they all rate his ill 
0	which drives the creeping thief to some regard 
0	the threshold grates the door to have him heard 
0	night wand ring weasels shriek to see him there 
0	they fright him yet he still pursues his fear 
0	as each unwilling portal yields him way 
0	through little vents and crannies of the place
0	the wind wars with his torch to make him stay 
0	and blows the smoke of it into his face 
0	extinguishing his conduct in this case 
0	but his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch 
0	puffs forth another wind that fires the torch 
0	and being lighted by the light he spies
0	lucretia s glove wherein her needle sticks 
0	he takes it from the rushes where it lies 
0	and griping it the neeld his finger pricks 
0	as who should say this glove to wanton tricks
0	is not inur d return again in haste 
0	thou see st our mistress ornaments are chaste 
0	but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him 
0	he in the worst sense construes their denial 
0	the doors the wind the glove that did delay him 
0	he takes for accidental things of trial 
0	or as those bars which stop the hourly dial 
0	who with a lingering stay his course doth let 
0	till every minute pays the hour his debt 
0	 so so quoth he these lets attend the time 
0	like little frosts that sometime threat the spring 
0	to add a more rejoicing to the prime 
0	and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing 
0	pain pays the income of each precious thing 
0	huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves and sands 
0	the merchant fears ere rich at home he lands 
0	now is he come unto the chamber door 
0	that shuts him from the heaven of his thought 
0	which with a yielding latch and with no more 
0	hath barr d him from the blessed thing he sought 
0	so from himself impiety hath wrought 
0	that for his prey to pray he doth begin 
0	as if the heavens should countenance his sin 
0	but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer 
0	having solicited the eternal power 
0	that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair 
0	and they would stand auspicious to the hour 
0	even there he starts quoth he i must de flower 
0	the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact 
0	how can they then assist me in the act 
0	 then love and fortune be my gods my guide 
0	my will is back d with resolution 
0	thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried 
0	the blackest sin is clear d with absolution 
0	against love s fire fear s frost hath dissolution 
0	the eye of heaven is out and misty night
0	covers the shame that follows sweet delight 
0	this said his guilty hand pluck d up the latch 
0	and with his knee the door he opens wide 
0	the dove sleeps fast that this night owl will catch 
0	thus treason works ere traitors be espied 
0	who sees the lurking serpent steps aside 
0	but she sound sleeping fearing no such thing 
0	lies at the mercy of his mortal sting 
0	into the chamber wickedly he stalks 
0	and gazeth on her yet unstained bed 
0	the curtains being close about he walks 
0	rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head 
0	by their high treason is his heart misled 
0	which gives the watch word to his hand full soon
0	to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon 
0	look as the fair and fiery pointed sun 
0	rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight 
0	even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun
0	to wink being blinded with a greater light 
0	whether it is that she reflects so bright 
0	that dazzleth them or else some shame supposed 
0	but blind they are and keep themselves enclosed 
0	o had they in that darksome prison died 
0	then had they seen the period of their ill 
0	then collatine again by lucrece side
0	in his clear bed might have reposed still 
0	but they must ope this blessed league to kill 
0	and holy thoughted lucrece to their sight
0	must sell her joy her life her world s delight 
0	her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under 
0	cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss 
0	who therefore angry seems to part in sunder 
0	swelling on either side to want his bliss 
0	between whose hills her head entombed is 
0	where like a virtuous monument she lies 
0	to be admir d of lewd unhallow d eyes 
0	without the bed her other fair hand was 
0	on the green coverlet whose perfect white
0	show d like an april daisy on the grass 
0	with pearly sweat resembling dew of night 
0	her eyes like marigolds had sheath d their light

0	as if between them twain there were no strife 
0	but that life liv d in death and death in life 
0	her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue 
0	a pair of maiden worlds unconquered 
0	save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew 
0	and him by oath they truly honoured 
0	these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred 
0	who like a foul usurper went about
0	from this fair throne to heave the owner out 
0	what could he see but mightily he noted

0	wounding itself to death rise up and fall 
0	beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal 
0	this moves in him more rage and lesser pity

0	first like a trumpet doth his tongue begin
0	to sound a parley to his heartless foe 
0	who o er the white sheet peers her whiter chin 
0	the reason of this rash alarm to know 
0	but she with vehement prayers urgeth still
0	under what colour he commits this ill 
0	thus he replies the colour in thy face 
0	 that even for anger makes the lily pale 
0	and the red rose blush at her own disgrace 
0	shall plead for me and tell my loving tale 
0	under that colour am i come to scale
0	thy never conquer d fort the fault is thine 
0	for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine 
0	 thus i forestall thee if thou mean to chide 
0	thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night

0	my will that marks thee for my earth s delight 
0	which i to conquer sought with all my might 
0	but as reproof and reason beat it dead 
0	by thy bright beauty was it newly bred 
0	 i see what crosses my attempt will bring 
0	i know what thorns the growing rose defends 
0	i think the honey guarded with a sting 
0	all this beforehand counsel comprehends 
0	but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends

0	i know repentant tears ensue the deed

0	the scornful mark of every open eye 
0	thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain

0	shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes 
0	and sung by children in succeeding times 
0	 but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend 
0	the fault unknown is as a thought unacted 
0	a little harm done to a great good end 
0	for lawful policy remains enacted 
0	the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
0	in a pure compound being so applied 
0	his venom in effect is purified 
0	 then for thy husband and thy children s sake 
0	tender my suit bequeath not to their lot
0	the shame that from them no device can take 
0	the blemish that will never be forgot 
0	worse than a slavish wipe or birth hour s blot

0	while she the picture of pure piety 
0	like a white hind under the grype s sharp claws 
0	pleads in a wilderness where are no laws 
0	to the rough beast that knows no gentle right 
0	nor aught obeys but his foul appetite 
0	but when a black fac d cloud the world doth threat 
0	in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding 
0	from earth s dark womb some gentle gust doth get 
0	which blows these pitchy vapours from their biding 
0	hindering their present fall by this dividing 
0	so his unhallow d haste her words delays 
0	and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays 
0	yet foul night working cat he doth but dally 
0	while in his hold fast foot the weak mouse panteth 
0	her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly 
0	a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth 
0	his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth
0	no penetrable entrance to her plaining 
0	tears harden lust though marble wear with raining 
0	her pity pleading eyes are sadly fix d
0	in the remorseless wrinkles of his face 
0	her modest eloquence with sighs is mix d 
0	which to her oratory adds more grace 
0	she puts the period often from his place 
0	and midst the sentence so her accent breaks 
0	that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks 
0	she conjures him by high almighty jove 
0	by knighthood gentry and sweet friendship s oath 
0	by her untimely tears her husband s love 
0	by holy human law and common troth 
0	by heaven and earth and all the power of both 
0	that to his borrow d bed he make retire

0	mar not the thing that cannot be amended 
0	end thy ill aim before the shoot be ended 
0	he is no woodman that doth bend his bow

0	 my husband is thy friend for his sake spare me 
0	thyself art mighty for thine own sake leave me 
0	myself a weakling do not then ensnare me 
0	thou look st not like deceit do not deceive me 
0	my sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee 
0	if ever man were mov d with woman s moans

0	 all which together like a troubled ocean

0	if in thy hope thou dar st do such outrage 
0	what dar st thou not when once thou art a king 
0	o be remember d no outrageous thing
0	from vassal actors can he wip d away 
0	then kings misdeeds cannot be hid in clay 
0	 this deed will make thee only lov d for fear

0	with foul offenders thou perforce must bear 
0	when they in thee the like offences prove

0	for princes are the glass the school the book

0	wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
0	authority for sin warrant for blame

0	thou back st reproach against long living laud 
0	and mak st fair reputation but a bawd 
0	 hast thou command by him that gave it thee 
0	from a pure heart command thy rebel will 
0	draw not thy sword to guard iniquity

0	thy princely office how canst thou fulfill 
0	when pattern d by thy fault foul sin may say

0	 think but how vile a spectacle it were
0	to view thy present trespass in another 
0	men s faults do seldom to themselves appear 
0	their own transgressions partially they smother 
0	this guilt would seem death worthy in thy brother 
0	o how are they wrapp d in with infamies

0	turns not but swells the higher by this let 
0	small lights are soon blown out huge fires abide

0	the petty streams that pay a daily debt

0	the lesser thing should not the greater hide 
0	the cedar stoops not to the base shrub s foot

0	 so let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state 
0	 no more quoth he by heaven i will not hear thee 
0	yield to my love if not enforced hate 
0	instead of love s coy touch shall rudely tear thee 
0	that done despitefully i mean to bear thee
0	unto the base bed of some rascal groom 
0	to be thy partner in this shameful doom 
0	this said he sets his foot upon the light 
0	for light and lust are deadly enemies 
0	shame folded up in blind concealing night 
0	when most unseen then most doth tyrannize 
0	the wolf hath seiz d his prey the poor lamb cries 
0	till with her own white fleece her voice controll d
0	entombs her outcry in her lips sweet fold 
0	for with the nightly linen that she wears
0	he pens her piteous clamours in her head 
0	cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
0	that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed 
0	o that prone lust should stain so pure a bed 
0	the spots whereof could weeping purify 
0	her tears should drop on them perpetually 
0	but she hath lost a dearer thing than life 
0	and he hath won what he would lose again 
0	this forced league doth force a further strife 
0	this momentary joy breeds months of pain 
0	this hot desire converts to cold disdain 
0	pure chastity is rifled of her store 
0	and lust the thief far poorer than before 
0	look as the full fed hound or gorged hawk 
0	unapt for tender smell or speedy flight 
0	make slow pursuit or altogether balk
0	the prey wherein by nature they delight 
0	so surfeit taking tarquin fares this night 
0	his taste delicious in digestion souring 
0	devours his will that liv d by foul devouring 
0	o deeper sin than bottomless conceit
0	can comprehend in still imagination 
0	drunken desire must vomit his receipt 
0	ere he can see his own abomination 
0	while lust is in his pride no exclamation
0	can curb his heat or rein his rash desire 
0	till like a jade self will himself doth tire 
0	and then with lank and lean discolour d cheek 
0	with heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace 
0	feeble desire all recreant poor and meek 
0	like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case 
0	the flesh being proud desire doth fight with grace 
0	for there it revels and when that decays 
0	the guilty rebel for remission prays 
0	so fares it with this faultful lord of rome 
0	who this accomplishment so hotly chas d 
0	for now against himself he sounds this doom 
0	that through the length of times he stands disgrac d 
0	besides his soul s fair temple is defac d 
0	to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares 
0	to ask the spotted princess how she fares 
0	she says her subjects with foul insurrection
0	have batter d down her consecrated wall 
0	and by their mortal fault brought in subjection
0	her immortality and made her thrall
0	to living death and pain perpetual 
0	which in her prescience she controlled still 
0	but her foresight could not forestall their will 
0	even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth 
0	a captive victor that hath lost in gain 
0	bearing away the wound that nothing healeth 
0	my untutored lines makes it assured of acceptance what i have
0	the scar that will despite of cure remain 
0	leaving his spoil perplex d in greater pain 
0	she hears the load of lust he left behind 
0	and he the burthen of a guilty mind 
0	he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence 
0	she like a wearied lamb lies panting there 
0	he scowls and hates himself for his offence 
0	she desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear 
0	he faintly flies sweating with guilty fear 
0	she stays exclaiming on the direful night 
0	he runs and chides his vanish d loath d delight 
0	he thence departs a heavy convertite 
0	she there remains a hopeless castaway 
0	he in his speed looks for the morning light 
0	she prays she never may behold the day 
0	 for day quoth she night s scapes doth open lay 
0	and my true eyes have never practis d how
0	to cloak offences with a cunning brow 
0	 they think not but that every eye can see
0	the same disgrace which they themselves behold 
0	and therefore would they still in darkness be 
0	to have their unseen sin remain untold 
0	for they their guilt with weeping will unfold 
0	and grave like water that doth eat in steel 
0	upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel 
0	here she exclaims against repose and rest 
0	and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind 
0	she wakes her heart by beating on her breast 
0	and bids it leap from thence where it may find
0	some purer chest to close so pure a mind 
0	frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
0	against the unseen secrecy of night 
0	 o comfort killing night image of hell 
0	dim register and notary of shame 
0	black stage for tragedies and murders fell 
0	vast sin concealing chaos nurse of blame 
0	blind muffled bawd dark harbour for defame 
0	grim cave of death whispering conspirator
0	with close tongued treason and the ravisher 
0	 o hateful vaporous and foggy night 
0	since thou art guilty of my cureless crime 
0	muster thy mists to meet the eastern light 
0	make war against proportion d course of time 
0	or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
0	his wonted height yet ere he go to bed 
0	knit poisonous clouds about his golden head 
0	 with rotten damps ravish the morning air 
0	let their exhal d unwholesome breaths make sick
0	the life of purity the supreme fair 
0	ere he arrive his weary noontide prick 
0	and let thy misty vapours march so thick 
0	that in their smoky ranks his smother d light
0	may set at noon and make perpetual night 
0	 were tarquin night as he is but night s child 
0	the silver shining queen he would distain 
0	her twinkling handmaids too by him defil d 
0	through night s black bosom should not peep again 
0	so should i have co partners in my pain 
0	and fellowship in woe doth woe assuage 
0	as palmers chat makes short their pilgrimage 
0	 where now i have no one to blush with me 
0	to cross their arms and hang their heads with mine 
0	to mask their brows and hide their infamy 
0	but i alone alone must sit and pine 
0	seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine 
0	mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans 
0	poor wasting monuments of lasting moans 
0	 o night thou furnace of foul reeking smoke 
0	let not the jealous day behold that face
0	which underneath thy black all hiding cloak
0	immodesty lies martyr d with disgrace 
0	keep still possession of thy gloomy place 
0	that all the faults which in thy reign are made 
0	may likewise be sepulchred in thy shade 
0	 make me not object to the tell tale day 
0	the light will show character d in my brow 
0	the story of sweet chastity s decay 
0	the impious breach of holy wedlock vow 
0	yea the illiterate that know not how
0	to cipher what is writ in learned books 
0	will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks 
0	 the nurse to still her child will tell my story
0	and fright her crying babe with tarquin s name 
0	the orator to deck his oratory 
0	will couple my reproach to tarquin s shame 
0	feast finding minstrels tuning my defame 
0	will tie the hearers to attend each line 
0	how tarquin wronged me i collatine 
0	 let my good name that senseless reputation 
0	for collatine s dear love be kept unspotted 
0	if that be made a theme for disputation 
0	the branches of another root are rotted 
0	and undeserved reproach to him allotted 
0	that is as clear from this attaint of mine
0	as i ere this was pure to collatine 
0	 o unseen shame invisible disgrace 
0	o unfelt sore crest wounding private scar 
0	reproach is stamp d in collatinus face

0	alas how many bear such shameful blows 
0	which not themselves but he that gives them knows 
0	 if collatine thine honour lay in me 
0	from me by strong assault it is bereft 
0	my honey lost and i a drone like bee

0	but robb d and ransack d by injurious theft 
0	in thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept 
0	and suck d the honey which thy chaste bee kept 
0	 yet am i guilty of thy honour s wrack 
0	yet for thy honour did i entertain him 
0	coming from thee i could not put him back 
0	for it had been dishonour to disdain him 
0	besides of weariness he did complain him

0	why pryest thou through my window leave thy peeping

0	as the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze

0	this plot of death when sadly she had laid 
0	and wip d the brinish pearl from her bright eyes 
0	with untun d tongue she hoarsely call d her maid 
0	whose swift obedience to her mistress hies 
0	for fleet wing d duty with thought s feathers flies 
0	poor lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so
0	as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow 
0	her mistress she doth give demure good morrow 
0	with soft slow tongue true mark of modesty 
0	and sorts a sad look to her lady s sorrow 
0	 for why her face wore sorrow s livery 
0	but durst not ask of her audaciously
0	why her two suns were cloud eclipsed so 
0	nor why her fair cheeks over wash d with woe 
0	but as the earth doth weep the sun being set 
0	each flower moisten d like a melting eye 
0	even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
0	her circled eyne enforc d by sympathy
0	of those fair suns set in her mistress sky 
0	who in a salt wav d ocean quench their light 
0	which makes the maid weep like the dewy night 
0	a pretty while these pretty creatures stand 
0	like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling 
0	one justly weeps the other takes in hand
0	no cause but company of her drops spilling 
0	their gentle sex to weep are often willing 
0	grieving themselves to guess at others smarts 
0	and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts 
0	for men have marble women waxen minds 
0	and therefore are they form d as marble will 
0	the weak oppress d the impression of strange kinds
0	is form d in them by force by fraud or skill 
0	then call them not the authors of their ill 
0	no more than wax shall be accounted evil 
0	wherein is stamp d the semblance of a devil 
0	their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain 
0	lays open all the little worms that creep 
0	in men as in a rough grown grove remain
0	cave keeping evils that obscurely sleep 
0	through crystal walls each little mote will peep 
0	though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks 
0	poor women s faces are their own faults books 
0	no man inveigb against the wither d flower 
0	but chide rough winter that the flower hath kill d 
0	not that devour d but that which doth devour 
0	is worthy blame o let it not be hild
0	poor women s faults that they are so fulfill d

0	make weak made women tenants to their shame 
0	the precedent whereof in lucrece view 
0	assail d by night with circumstances strong
0	of present death and shame that might ensue
0	by that her death to do her husband wrong 
0	such danger to resistance did belong 
0	the dying fear through all her body spread 
0	and who cannot abuse a body dead 
0	by this mild patience bid fair lucrece speak
0	to the poor counterfeit of her complaining 
0	 my girl quoth she on what occasion break
0	those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are raining 
0	if thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining 
0	know gentle wench it small avails my mood 
0	if tears could help mine own would do me good 
0	 but tell me girl when went and there she stay d
0	till after a deep groan tarquin from hence 
0	 madam ere i was up replied the maid 
0	 the more to blame my sluggard negligence 
0	yet with the fault i thus far can dispense 
0	myself was stirring ere the break of day 
0	and ere i rose was tarquin gone away 
0	 but lady if your maid may be so bold 
0	she would request to know your heaviness 
0	 o peace quoth lucrece if it should be told 
0	the repetition cannot make it less 
0	for more it is than i can well express 
0	and that deep torture may be call d a hell 
0	when more is felt than one hath power to tell 
0	 go get me hither paper ink and pen 
0	yet save that labour for i have them here 
0	what should i say one of my husband s men
0	bid thou be ready by and by to bear
0	a letter to my lord my love my dear 
0	bid him with speed prepare to carry it 
0	the cause craves haste and it will soon be writ 
0	her maid is gone and she prepares to write 
0	first hovering o er the paper with her quill 
0	conceit and grief an eager combat fight 
0	what wit sets down is blotted straight with will 
0	this is too curious good this blunt and ill 
0	much like a press of people at a door 
0	throng her inventions which shall go before 
0	at last she thus begins thou worthy lord
0	of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee 
0	health to thy person next vouchsafe to afford
0	 if ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see 
0	some present speed to come and visit me 
0	so i commend me from our house in grief 
0	my woes are tedious though my words are brief 
0	here folds she up the tenor of her woe 
0	her certain sorrow writ uncertainly 
0	by this short schedule collatine may know
0	her grief but not her grief s true quality 
0	she dares not thereof make discovery 
0	lest he should hold it her own gross abuse 
0	ere she with blood had stain d her stain d excuse 
0	besides the life and feeling of her passion
0	she hoards to spend when he is by to hear her 
0	when sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
0	of her disgrace the better so to clear her
0	from that suspicion which the world my might bear her 
0	to shun this blot she would not blot the letter
0	with words till action might become them better 
0	to see sad sights moves more than hear them told 
0	for then the eye interprets to the ear
0	the heavy motion that it doth behold 
0	when every part a part of woe doth bear 
0	 tis but a part of sorrow that we hear 
0	deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords 
0	and sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words 
0	her letter now is seal d and on it writ
0	 at ardea to my lord with more than haste 
0	the post attends and she delivers it 
0	charging the sour fac d groom to hie as fast
0	as lagging fowls before the northern blast 
0	speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems 
0	extremely still urgeth such extremes 
0	the homely villain court sies to her low 
0	and blushing on her with a steadfast eye
0	receives the scroll without or yea or no 
0	and forth with bashful innocence doth hie 
0	but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
0	imagine every eye beholds their blame 
0	for lucrece thought he blush d to see her shame 
0	when silly groom god wot it was defect
0	of spirit life and bold audacity 
0	such harmless creatures have a true respect
0	to talk in deeds while others saucily
0	promise more speed but do it leisurely 
0	even so this pattern of the worn out age
0	pawn d honest looks but laid no words to gage 
0	his kindled duty kindled her mistrust 
0	that two red fires in both their faces blaz d 
0	she thought he blush d as knowing tarquin s lust 
0	and blushing with him wistly on him gaz d 
0	her earnest eye did make him more amaz d 
0	the more saw the blood his cheeks replenish 
0	the more she thought he spied in her some blemish 
0	but long she thinks till he return again 
0	and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone 
0	the weary time she cannot entertain 
0	for now tis stale to sigh to weep to groan 
0	so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan 
0	that she her plaints a little while doth stay 
0	pausing for means to mourn some newer way 
0	at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
0	of skilful painting made for priam s troy 
0	before the which is drawn the power of greece 
0	for helen s rape the city to destroy 
0	threat ning cloud kissing ilion with annoy 
0	which the conceited painter drew so proud 
0	as heaven it seem d to kiss the turrets bow d 
0	a thousand lamentable objects there 
0	in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life 
0	many a dry drop seem d a weeping tear 
0	shed for the slaughter d husband by the wife 
0	the red blood reek d to show the painter s strife 
0	the dying eyes gleam d forth their ashy lights 
0	like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights 
0	there might you see the labouring pioner
0	begrim d with sweat and smeared all with dust 
0	and from the towers of troy there would appear
0	the very eyes of men through loopholes thrust 
0	gazing upon the greeks with little lust 
0	such sweet observance in this work was had 
0	that one might see those far off eyes look sad 
0	in great commanders grace and majesty
0	you might behold triumphing in their faces 
0	in youth quick bearing and dexterity 
0	and here and there the painter interlaces
0	pale cowards marching on with trembling paces 
0	which heartless peasants did so well resemble 
0	that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble 
0	in ajax and ulysses o what art
0	of physiognomy might one behold 
0	the face of either cipher d either s heart 
0	their face their manners most expressly told 
0	in ajax eyes blunt rage and rigour roll d 
0	but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent
0	show d deep regard and smiling government 
0	there pleading might you see grave nestor stand 
0	as t were encouraging the greeks to fight 
0	making such sober action with his hand
0	that it beguiled attention charm d the sight 
0	in speech it seem d his beard all silver white 
0	wagg d up and down and from his lips did fly
0	thin winding breath which purl d up to the sky 
0	about him were a press of gaping faces 
0	which seem d to swallow up his sound advice 
0	all jointly listening but with several graces 
0	as if some mermaid did their ears entice 
0	some high some low the painter was so nice 
0	the scalps of many almost hid behind 
0	to jump up higher seem d to mock the mind 
0	here one man s hand lean d on another s head 
0	his nose being shadow d by his neighbour s ear 
0	here one being throng d bears back all boll n and red 
0	another smother d seems to pelt and swear 
0	and in their rage such signs of rage they bear 
0	as but for loss of nestor s golden words 
0	it seem d they would debate with angry swords 
0	for much imaginary work was there 
0	conceit deceitful so compact so kind 
0	that for achilles image stood his spear 
0	grip d in an armed hand himself behind 
0	was left unseen save to the eye of mind 
0	a hand a foot a face a leg a head 
0	stood for the whole to be imagined 
0	and from the walls of strong besieged troy
0	when their brave hope bold hector march d to field 
0	stood many trojan mothers sharing joy
0	to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield 
0	and to their hope they such odd action yield 
0	that through their light joy seemed to appear 
0	 like bright things stain d a kind of heavy fear 
0	and from the strond of dardan where they fought 
0	to simois reedy banks the red blood ran 
0	whose waves to imitate the battle sought
0	with swelling ridges and their ranks began
0	to break upon the galled shore and than
0	retire again till meeting greater ranks 
0	they join and shoot their foam at simois banks 
0	to this well painted piece is lucrece come 
0	to find a face where all distress is stell d 
0	many she sees where cares have carved some 
0	but none where all distress and dolour dwell d 
0	till she despairing hecuba beheld 
0	staring on priam s wounds with her old eyes 
0	which bleeding under pyrrhus proud foot lies 
0	in her the painter had anatomiz d
0	time s ruin beauty s wrack and grim care s reign 
0	her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguis d 
0	of what she was no semblance did remain 
0	her blue blood chang d to black in every vein 
0	wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed 
0	show d life imprison d in a body dead 
0	on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes 
0	and shapes her sorrow to the beldame s woes 
0	who nothing wants to answer her but cries 
0	and bitter words to ban her cruel foes 
0	the painter was no god to lend her those 
0	and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong 
0	to give her so much grief and not a tongue 
0	 poor instrument quoth she without a sound 
0	i ll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue 
0	and drop sweet balm in priam s painted wound 
0	and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong 
0	and with my tears quench troy that burns so long 
0	and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
0	of all the greeks that are thine enemies 
0	 show me the strumpet that began this stir 
0	that with my nails her beauty i may tear 
0	thy heat of lust fond paris did incur
0	this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear 
0	thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here 
0	and here in troy for trespass of thine eye 
0	the sire the son the dame and daughter die 
0	 why should the private pleasure of some one
0	become the public plague of many mo 
0	let sin alone committed light alone
0	upon his head that hath transgressed so 
0	let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe 
0	for one s offence why should so many fall 
0	to plague a private sin in general 
0	 lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies 
0	here manly hector faints here troilus swounds 
0	here friend by friend in bloody channel lies 
0	and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds 
0	and one man s lust these many lives confounds 
0	had doting priam check d his son s desire 
0	troy had been bright with fame and not with fire 
0	here feelingly she weeps troy s painted woes 
0	for sorrow like a heavy hanging bell 
0	once set on ringing with his own weight goes 
0	then little strength rings out the doleful knell 
0	so lucrece set a work sad tales doth tell
0	to pencill d pensiveness and colour d sorrow 
0	she lends them words and she their looks doth borrow 
0	she throws her eyes about the painting round 
0	and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament 
0	at last she sees a wretched image bound 
0	that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent 
0	his face though full of cares yet show d content 
0	onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes 
0	so mild that patience seem d to scorn his woes 
0	in him the painter labour d with his skill
0	to hide deceit and give the harmless show
0	an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still 
0	a brow unbent that seem d to welcome woe 
0	cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so
0	that blushing red no guilty instance gave 
0	nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have 
0	but like a constant and confirmed devil 
0	he entertain d a show so seeming just 
0	and therein so ensconc d his secret evil 
0	that jealousy itself cold not mistrust
0	false creeping craft and perjury should thrust
0	into so bright a day such black fac d storms 
0	or blot with hell born sin such saint like forms 
0	the well skill d workman this mild image drew
0	for perjur d sinon whose enchanting story
0	the credulous old priam after slew 
0	whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
0	of rich built ilion that the skies were sorry 
0	and little stars shot from their fixed places 
0	when their glass fell wherein they view d their faces 
0	this picture she advisedly perus d 
0	and chid the painter for his wondrous skill 
0	saying some shape in sinon s was abus d 
0	so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill 
0	and still on him she gaz d and gazing still 
0	such signs of truth in his plain face she spied 
0	that she concludes the picture was belied 
0	 it cannot be quoth she that so much guile 
0	 she would have said can lurk in such a look 
0	but tarquin s shape came in her mind the while 
0	and from her tongue can lurk from cannot took 
0	 it cannot be she in that sense forsook 
0	and turn d it thus it cannot be i find 
0	but such a face should bear a wicked mind 
0	 for even as subtle sinon here is painted 
0	so sober sad so weary and so mild 
0	 as if with grief or travail he had fainted 
0	to me came tarquin armed so beguil d
0	with outward honesty but yet defil d
0	with inward vice as priam him did cherish 
0	so did i tarquin so my troy did perish 
0	 look look how listening priam wets his eyes 
0	to see those borrow d tears that sinon sheds 
0	priam why art thou old and yet not wise 
0	for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds 
0	his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds 
0	those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity

0	these contraries such unity do hold 
0	only to flatter fools and make them bold 
0	so priam s trust false sinon s tears doth flatter

0	here all enrag d such passion her assails

0	comparing him to that unhappy guest
0	whose deed hath made herself herself detest 
0	at last she smilingly with this gives o er 
0	 fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore 
0	thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow 
0	and time doth weary time with her complaining 
0	she looks for night and then she longs for morrow 
0	and both she thinks too long with her remaining 
0	short time seems long in sorrow s sharp sustaining 
0	though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps 
0	and they that watch see time how slow it creeps 
0	which all this time hath overslipp d her thought

0	blue circles stream d like rainbows in the sky 
0	these water galls in her dim element
0	foretell new storms to those already spent 
0	which when her sad beholding husband saw 
0	amazedly in her sad face he stares 
0	her eyes though sod in tears look d red and raw 
0	her lively colour kill d with deadly cares 
0	he hath no power to ask her how she fares 
0	both stood like old acquaintance in a trance

0	she modestly prepares to let them know
0	her honour is ta en prisoner by the foe

0	with sad attention long to hear her words 
0	and now this pale swan in her watery nest
0	begins the sad dirge of her certain ending 
0	 few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best 
0	where no excuse can give the fault amending 
0	in me more woes than words are now depending 
0	and my laments would be drawn out too long

0	 then be this all the task it hath to say 
0	dear husband in the interest of thy bed
0	a stranger came and on that pillow lay
0	where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head 
0	and what wrong else may be imagined
0	by foul enforcement might be done to me 
0	from that alas thy lucrece is not free 
0	 for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight 
0	with shining falchion in my chamber came
0	a creeping creature with a flaming light 
0	and softly cried awake thou roman dame 
0	and entertain my love else lasting shame
0	on thee and thine this night i will inflict 
0	if thou my love s desire do contradict 
0	 for some hard favour d groom of thine quoth he 
0	unless thou yoke thy liking to my will 
0	i ll murder straight and then i ll slaughter thee
0	and swear i found you where you did fulfil
0	the loathsome act of lust and so did kill
0	the lechers in their deed this act will be
0	my fame and thy perpetual infamy 
0	 with this i did begin to start and cry 
0	and then against my heart he sets his sword 
0	swearing unless i took all patiently 
0	i should not live to speak another word 
0	so should my shame still rest upon record 
0	and never be forgot in mighty rome
0	the adulterate death of lucrece and her groom 
0	 mine enemy was strong my poor self weak 
0	and far the weaker with so strong a fear 
0	my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak 
0	no rightful plea might plead for justice there 
0	his scarlet lust came evidence to swear
0	that my poor beauty had purloin d his eyes 
0	and when the judge is robb d the prisoner dies 
0	 o teach me how to make mine own excuse

0	with head declin d and voice damm d up with woe 
0	with sad set eyes and wretched arms across 
0	from lips new waxen pale begins to blow
0	the grief away that stops his answer so 
0	but wretched as he is he strives in vain 
0	what he breathes out his breath drinks up again 
0	as through an arch the violent roaring tide
0	outruns the eye that doth behold his haste 
0	yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
0	back to the strait that forc d him on so fast 
0	in rage sent out recall d in rage being past 
0	even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw 
0	to push grief on and back the same grief draw 
0	which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth 
0	and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh 
0	 dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
0	another power no flood by raining slaketh 
0	my woe too sensible thy passion maketh
0	more feeling painful let it then suffice
0	to drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes

0	be suddenly revenged on my foe 
0	thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me
0	from what is past the help that thou shalt lend me
0	comes all too late yet let the traitor die 
0	for sparing justice feeds iniquity 
0	 but ere i name him you fair lords quoth she 
0	 speaking to those that came with collatine 
0	 shall plight your honourable faiths to me 
0	with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine 
0	for tis a meritorious fair design
0	to chase injustice with revengeful arms 
0	knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms 
0	at this request with noble disposition
0	each present lord began to promise aid 
0	as bound in knighthood to her imposition 
0	longing to hear the hateful foe bewray d 
0	but she that yet her sad task hath not said 
0	the protestation stops o speak quoth she 
0	 how may this forced stain be wip d from me 
0	 what is the quality of mine offence 
0	being constrain d with dreadful circumstance 
0	may my pure mind with the foul act dispense 
0	my low declined honour to advance 
0	may any terms acquit me from this chance 
0	the poison d fountain clears itself again 
0	and why not i from this compelled stain 
0	with this they all at once began to say 
0	her body s stain her mind untainted clears 
0	while with a joyless smile she turns away
0	the face that map which deep impression bears
0	of hard misfortune carv d in it with tears 
0	 no no quoth she no dame hereafter living 
0	by my excuse shall claim excuse s giving 
0	here with a sigh as if her heart would break 
0	she throws forth tarquin s name he he she says 
0	but more than he her poor tongue could not speak 
0	till after many accents and delays 
0	untimely breathings sick and short assays 
0	she utters this he he fair lords tis he 
0	that guides this hand to give this wound to me 
0	even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
0	a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheath d 
0	that blow did bail it from the deep unrest
0	of that polluted prison where it breath d 
0	her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath d
0	her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly
0	life s lasting date from cancell d destiny 
0	stone still astonish d with this deadly deed 
0	stood collatine and all his lordly crew 
0	till lucrece father that beholds her bleed 
0	himself on her self slaughter d body threw 
0	and from the purple fountain brutus drew
0	the murderous knife and as it left the place 
0	her blood in poor revenge held it in chase 
0	and bubbling from her breast it doth divide
0	in two slow rivers that the crimson blood
0	circles her body in on every side 
0	who like a late sack d island vastly stood
0	bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood 
0	some of her blood still pure and red remain d 
0	and some look d black and that false tarquin stain d 
0	about the mourning and congealed face
0	of that black blood a watery rigol goes 
0	which seems to weep upon the tainted place 
0	and ever since as pitying lucrece woes 
0	corrupted blood some watery token shows 
0	and blood untainted still doth red abide 
0	blushing at that which is so putrified 
0	 daughter dear daughter old lucretius cries 
0	 that life was mine which thou hast here depriv d 
0	if in the child the father s image lies 
0	where shall i live now lucrece is unliv d 
0	thou wast not to this end from me deriv d
0	if children pre decease progenitors 
0	we are their offspring and they none of ours 
0	 poor broken glass i often did behold
0	in thy sweet semblance my old age new born 
0	but now that fair fresh mirror dim and old 
0	shows me a bare bon d death by time outworn 
0	o from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn 
0	and shiver d all the beauty of my glass 
0	that i no more can see what once i was 
0	 o time cease thou thy course and last no longer 
0	if they surcease to be that should survive 
0	shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger 
0	and leave the faltering feeble souls alive 
0	the old bees die the young possess their hive 
0	then live sweet lucrece live again and see
0	thy father die and not thy father thee 
0	by this starts collatine as from a dream 
0	and bids lucretius give his sorrow place 
0	and then in key cold lucrece bleeding stream
0	he falls and bathes the pale fear in his face 
0	and counterfeits to die with her a space 
0	till manly shame bids him possess his breath 
0	and live to be revenged on her death 
0	the deep vexation of his inward soul
0	who mad that sorrow should his use control 
0	or keep him from heart easing words so long 
0	begins to talk but through his lips do throng
0	weak words so thick come in his poor heart s aid 
0	that no man could distinguish what he said 
0	yet sometime tarquin was pronounced plain 
0	but through his teeth as if the name he tore 
0	this windy tempest till it blow up rain 
0	held back his sorrow s tide to make it more 
0	at last it rains and busy winds give o er 
0	then son and father weep with equal strife 
0	who should weep most for daughter or for wife 
0	the one doth call her his the other his 
0	yet neither may possess the claim they lay 
0	the father says she s mine o mine she is 
0	replies her husband do not take away
0	my sorrow s interest let no mourner say
0	he weeps for her for she was only mine 
0	and only must be wail d by collatine 
0	 o quoth lucretius i did give that life
0	which she too early and too late hath spill d 
0	 woe woe quoth collatine she was my wife 
0	i owed her and tis mine that she hath kill d 
0	 my daughter and my wife with clamours fill d
0	the dispers d air who holding lucrece life 
0	answer d their cries my daughter and my wife 
0	brutus who pluck d the knife from lucrece side 
0	seeing such emulation in their woe 
0	began to clothe his wit in state and pride 
0	burying in lucrece wound his folly s show 
0	he with the romans was esteemed so
0	for sportive words and uttering foolish things 
0	but now he throws that shallow habit by 
0	wherein deep policy did him disguise 
0	and arm d his long hid wits advisedly 
0	to check the tears in collatinus eyes 
0	 thou wronged lord of rome quoth he arise 
0	let my unsounded self suppos d a fool 
0	now set thy long experienc d wit to school 
0	 why collatine is woe the cure for woe 
0	do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds 
0	is it revenge to give thyself a blow 
0	for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds 
0	such childish humour from weak minds proceeds 
0	thy wretched wife mistook the matter so 
0	to slay herself that should have slain her foe 
0	 courageous roman do not steep thy heart
0	in such relenting dew of lamentations 
0	but kneel with me and help to bear thy part 
0	to rouse our roman gods with invocations 
0	that they will suffer these abominations 
0	 since rome herself in them doth stand disgrac d 
0	by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chas d 
0	 now by the capitol that we adore 
0	and by this chaste blood so unjustly stain d 
0	by heaven s fair sun that breeds the fat earth s store 
0	by all our country rights in rome maintain d 
0	and by chaste lucrece soul that late complain d
0	her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife 
0	we will revenge the death of this true wife 
0	this said he struck his hand upon his breast 
0	and kiss d the fatal knife to end his vow 
0	and to his protestation urg d the rest 
0	who wondering at him did his words allow 
0	then jointly to the ground their knees they bow 
0	and that deep vow which brutus made before 
0	he doth again repeat and that they swore 
0	when they had sworn to this advised doom 
0	they did conclude to bear dead lucrece thence 
0	to show her bleeding body thorough rome 
0	and so to publish tarquin s foul offence 
0	which being done with speedy diligence 
0	the romans plausibly did give consent
0	to tarquin s everlasting banishment 
0	to this troop come thou not near 
0	from this session interdict

0	love hath reason reason none

0	ere long espied a fickle maid full pale 
0	tearing of papers breaking rings a twain 
0	storming her world with sorrow s wind and rain 
0	upon her head a platted hive of straw 
0	which fortified her visage from the sun 
0	whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
0	the carcase of a beauty spent and done 
0	time had not scythed all that youth begun 
0	nor youth all quit but spite of heaven s fell rage
0	some beauty peeped through lattice of sear d age 
0	oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne 
0	which on it had conceited characters 
0	laund ring the silken figures in the brine
0	that season d woe had pelleted in tears 
0	and often reading what contents it bears 
0	as often shrieking undistinguish d woe 
0	in clamours of all size both high and low 
0	sometimes her levell d eyes their carriage ride 
0	as they did battery to the spheres intend

0	for some untuck d descended her sheav d hat 
0	hanging her pale and pined cheek beside 
0	some in her threaden fillet still did bide 
0	and true to bondage would not break from thence 
0	though slackly braided in loose negligence 
0	a thousand favours from a maund she drew
0	of amber crystal and of beaded jet 
0	which one by one she in a river threw 
0	upon whose weeping margent she was set 
0	like usury applying wet to wet 
0	or monarchs hands that lets not bounty fall
0	where want cries some but where excess begs all 
0	of folded schedules had she many a one 
0	which she perus d sigh d tore and gave the flood

0	the swiftest hours observed as they flew 
0	towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew 
0	and privileg d by age desires to know
0	in brief the grounds and motives of her woe

0	 father she says though in me you behold

0	let it not tell your judgement i am old 
0	not age but sorrow over me hath power 
0	i might as yet have been a spreading flower 
0	fresh to myself if i had self applied
0	love to myself and to no love beside 
0	 but woe is me too early i attended
0	a youthful suit it was to gain my grace 
0	of one by nature s outwards so commended 
0	that maiden s eyes stuck over all his face 
0	love lack d a dwelling and made him her place 
0	and when in his fair parts she did abide 
0	she was new lodg d and newly deified 
0	 his browny locks did hang in crooked curls 
0	and every light occasion of the wind
0	upon his lips their silken parcels hurls 
0	what s sweet to do to do will aptly find 
0	each eye that saw him did enchant the mind 
0	for on his visage was in little drawn 
0	what largeness thinks in paradise was sawn 
0	 small show of man was yet upon his chin 
0	his phoenix down began but to appear 
0	like unshorn velvet on that termless skin 
0	whose bare out bragg d the web it seemed to wear 
0	yet show d his visage by that cost more dear 
0	and nice affections wavering stood in doubt
0	if best were as it was or best without 
0	his qualities were beauteous as his form 
0	for maiden tongued he was and thereof free 
0	yet if men mov d him was he such a storm
0	as oft twixt may and april is to see 
0	when winds breathe sweet unruly though they be 
0	his rudeness so with his authoriz d youth
0	did livery falseness in a pride of truth 
0	 well could he ride and often men would say
0	that horse his mettle from his rider takes 
0	proud of subjection noble by the sway 
0	what rounds what bounds what course what stop he makes 
0	and controversy hence a question takes 
0	whether the horse by him became his deed 
0	or he his manage by the well doing steed 
0	 but quickly on this side the verdict went 
0	his real habitude gave life and grace
0	to appertainings and to ornament 
0	accomplish d in himself not in his case 
0	all aids themselves made fairer by their place 
0	came for additions yet their purpos d trim

0	 so on the tip of his subduing tongue
0	all kind of arguments and question deep 
0	all replication prompt and reason strong 
0	for his advantage still did wake and sleep 
0	to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep 
0	he had the dialect and different skill 
0	catching all passions in his craft of will 
0	 that he did in the general bosom reign
0	of young of old and sexes both enchanted 
0	to dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
0	in personal duty following where he haunted 
0	consents bewitch d ere he desire have granted 
0	and dialogued for him what he would say 
0	ask d their own wills and made their wills obey 
0	 many there were that did his picture get 
0	to serve their eyes and in it put their mind 
0	like fools that in the imagination set
0	the goodly objects which abroad they find
0	of lands and mansions theirs in thought assign d 
0	and labouring in mo pleasures to bestow them

0	to say within thine own deep sunken eyes 
0	were an all eating shame and thriftless praise 
0	how much more praise deserv d thy beauty s use 
0	if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine
0	shall sum my count and make my old excuse 
0	proving his beauty by succession thine 
0	this were to be new made when thou art old 
0	and see thy blood warm when thou feel st it cold 
0	look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
0	now is the time that face should form another 
0	whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest 
0	thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother 
0	for where is she so fair whose unear d womb
0	disdains the tillage of thy husbandry 
0	or who is he so fond will be the tomb

0	thou art thy mother s glass and she in thee
0	calls back the lovely april of her prime 
0	so thou through windows of thine age shalt see 
0	despite of wrinkles this thy golden time 
0	but if thou live remember d not to be

0	and being frank she lends to those are free 
0	the bounteous largess given thee to give 
0	profitless usurer why dost thou use
0	so great a sum of sums yet canst not live 
0	for having traffic with thy self alone 
0	thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive 
0	then how when nature calls thee to be gone 
0	what acceptable audit canst thou leave 
0	thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee 
0	which used lives th executor to be 
0	those hours that with gentle work did frame
0	the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell 
0	will play the tyrants to the very same
0	and that unfair which fairly doth excel

0	then what could death do if thou shouldst depart 
0	leaving thee living in posterity 
0	be not self will d for thou art much too fair
0	to be death s conquest and make worms thine heir 
0	lo in the orient when the gracious light

0	serving with looks his sacred majesty 
0	and having climb d the steep up heavenly hill 
0	resembling strong youth in his middle age 
0	yet mortal looks adore his beauty still 
0	attending on his golden pilgrimage 
0	but when from highmost pitch with weary car 
0	like feeble age he reeleth from the day 
0	the eyes fore duteous now converted are

0	why lov st thou that which thou receiv st not gladly

0	if the true concord of well tuned sounds 
0	by unions married do offend thine ear 
0	they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
0	in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear 
0	mark how one string sweet husband to another 
0	strikes each in each by mutual ordering 
0	resembling sire and child and happy mother 
0	who all in one one pleasing note do sing 
0	whose speechless song being many seeming one 
0	sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none 
0	is it for fear to wet a widow s eye 
0	that thou consum st thy self in single life 
0	ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die 
0	the world will wail thee like a makeless wife 
0	the world will be thy widow and still weep
0	that thou no form of thee hast left behind 
0	when every private widow well may keep
0	by children s eyes her husband s shape in mind 
0	look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
0	shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it 
0	but beauty s waste hath in the world an end 
0	and kept unused the user so destroys it 
0	no love toward others in that bosom sits
0	that on himself such murd rous shame commits 
0	for shame deny that thou bear st love to any 
0	who for thy self art so unprovident 
0	grant if thou wilt thou art belov d of many 
0	but that thou none lov st is most evident 
0	for thou art so possess d with murderous hate 
0	that gainst thy self thou stick st not to conspire 
0	seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
0	which to repair should be thy chief desire 
0	o change thy thought that i may change my mind 
0	shall hate be fairer lodg d than gentle love 
0	be as thy presence is gracious and kind 
0	or to thyself at least kind hearted prove 
0	make thee another self for love of me 
0	that beauty still may live in thine or thee 
0	as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow st 
0	in one of thine from that which thou departest 
0	and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow st 
0	thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest 
0	herein lives wisdom beauty and increase 
0	without this folly age and cold decay 
0	if all were minded so the times should cease
0	and threescore year would make the world away 
0	let those whom nature hath not made for store 
0	harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish 
0	look whom she best endow d she gave thee more 
0	which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish 
0	she carv d thee for her seal and meant thereby 
0	thou shouldst print more not let that copy die 
0	when i do count the clock that tells the time 
0	and see the brave day sunk in hideous night 
0	when i behold the violet past prime 
0	and sable curls all silvered o er with white 
0	when lofty trees i see barren of leaves 
0	which erst from heat did canopy the herd 
0	and summer s green all girded up in sheaves 
0	borne on the bier with white and bristly beard 
0	then of thy beauty do i question make 
0	that thou among the wastes of time must go 
0	since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
0	and die as fast as they see others grow 
0	and nothing gainst time s scythe can make defence
0	save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence 
0	o that you were your self but love you are
0	no longer yours than you your self here live 
0	against this coming end you should prepare 
0	and your sweet semblance to some other give 
0	so should that beauty which you hold in lease
0	find no determination then you were
0	yourself again after yourself s decease 
0	when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear 
0	who lets so fair a house fall to decay 
0	which husbandry in honour might uphold 
0	against the stormy gusts of winter s day
0	and barren rage of death s eternal cold 
0	o none but unthrifts dear my love you know 
0	you had a father let your son say so 
0	not from the stars do i my judgement pluck 
0	and yet methinks i have astronomy 
0	but not to tell of good or evil luck 
0	of plagues of dearths or seasons quality 
0	nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell 
0	pointing to each his thunder rain and wind 
0	or say with princes if it shall go well
0	by oft predict that i in heaven find 
0	but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive 
0	and constant stars in them i read such art
0	as truth and beauty shall together thrive 
0	if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert 
0	or else of thee this i prognosticate 
0	 thy end is truth s and beauty s doom and date 
0	when i consider every thing that grows
0	holds in perfection but a little moment 
0	that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
0	whereon the stars in secret influence comment 
0	when i perceive that men as plants increase 
0	cheered and checked even by the self same sky 
0	vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease 
0	and wear their brave state out of memory 
0	then the conceit of this inconstant stay
0	sets you most rich in youth before my sight 
0	where wasteful time debateth with decay
0	to change your day of youth to sullied night 
0	and all in war with time for love of you 
0	as he takes from you i engraft you new 
0	but wherefore do not you a mightier way
0	make war upon this bloody tyrant time 
0	and fortify your self in your decay
0	with means more blessed than my barren rhyme 
0	now stand you on the top of happy hours 
0	and many maiden gardens yet unset 
0	with virtuous wish would bear you living flowers 
0	much liker than your painted counterfeit 
0	so should the lines of life that life repair 
0	which this time s pencil or my pupil pen 
0	neither in inward worth nor outward fair 
0	can make you live your self in eyes of men 
0	to give away yourself keeps yourself still 
0	and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill 
0	who will believe my verse in time to come 
0	if it were fill d with your most high deserts 
0	though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
0	which hides your life and shows not half your parts 
0	if i could write the beauty of your eyes 
0	and in fresh numbers number all your graces 
0	the age to come would say this poet lies 
0	such heavenly touches ne er touch d earthly faces 
0	so should my papers yellow d with their age 
0	be scorn d like old men of less truth than tongue 
0	and your true rights be term d a poet s rage
0	and stretched metre of an antique song 
0	but were some child of yours alive that time 
0	you should live twice in it and in my rhyme 
0	shall i compare thee to a summer s day 
0	thou art more lovely and more temperate 
0	rough winds do shake the darling buds of may 
0	and summer s lease hath all too short a date 
0	sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines 
0	and often is his gold complexion dimm d 
0	and every fair from fair sometime declines 
0	by chance or nature s changing course untrimm d 
0	but thy eternal summer shall not fade 
0	nor lose possession of that fair thou ow st 
0	nor shall death brag thou wander st in his shade 
0	when in eternal lines to time thou grow st 
0	so long as men can breathe or eyes can see 
0	so long lives this and this gives life to thee 
0	devouring time blunt thou the lion s paws 
0	and make the earth devour her own sweet brood 
0	pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger s jaws 
0	and burn the long liv d phoenix in her blood 
0	make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets 
0	and do whate er thou wilt swift footed time 
0	to the wide world and all her fading sweets 
0	but i forbid thee one most heinous crime 
0	o carve not with thy hours my love s fair brow 
0	nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen 
0	him in thy course untainted do allow
0	for beauty s pattern to succeeding men 
0	yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong 
0	my love shall in my verse ever live young 
0	a woman s face with nature s own hand painted 
0	hast thou the master mistress of my passion 
0	a woman s gentle heart but not acquainted
0	with shifting change as is false women s fashion 
0	an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling 
0	gilding the object whereupon it gazeth 
0	a man in hue all hues in his controlling 
0	which steals men s eyes and women s souls amazeth 
0	and for a woman wert thou first created 
0	till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting 
0	and by addition me of thee defeated 
0	by adding one thing to my purpose nothing 
0	but since she prick d thee out for women s pleasure 
0	mine be thy love and thy love s use their treasure 
0	so is it not with me as with that muse 
0	stirr d by a painted beauty to his verse 
0	who heaven itself for ornament doth use
0	and every fair with his fair doth rehearse 
0	making a couplement of proud compare 
0	with sun and moon with earth and sea s rich gems 
0	with april s first born flowers and all things rare 
0	that heaven s air in this huge rondure hems 
0	o let me true in love but truly write 
0	and then believe me my love is as fair
0	as any mother s child though not so bright
0	as those gold candles fix d in heaven s air 
0	let them say more that like of hearsay well 
0	i will not praise that purpose not to sell 
0	my glass shall not persuade me i am old 
0	so long as youth and thou are of one date 
0	but when in thee time s furrows i behold 
0	then look i death my days should expiate 
0	for all that beauty that doth cover thee 
0	is but the seemly raiment of my heart 
0	which in thy breast doth live as thine in me 
0	how can i then be elder than thou art 
0	o therefore love be of thyself so wary
0	but as the riper should by time decease 
0	as i not for myself but for thee will 
0	bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
0	as tender nurse her babe from faring ill 
0	presume not on thy heart when mine is slain 
0	thou gav st me thine not to give back again 
0	as an unperfect actor on the stage 
0	who with his fear is put beside his part 
0	or some fierce thing replete with too much rage 
0	whose strength s abundance weakens his own heart 
0	so i for fear of trust forget to say
0	the perfect ceremony of love s rite 
0	and in mine own love s strength seem to decay 
0	o ercharg d with burthen of mine own love s might 
0	o let my looks be then the eloquence
0	who plead for love and look for recompense 
0	more than that tongue that more hath more express d 
0	o learn to read what silent love hath writ 
0	to hear with eyes belongs to love s fine wit 
0	mine eye hath play d the painter and hath stell d 
0	thy beauty s form in table of my heart 
0	my body is the frame wherein tis held 
0	and perspective it is best painter s art 
0	for through the painter must you see his skill 
0	to find where your true image pictur d lies 
0	which in my bosom s shop is hanging still 
0	that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes 
0	now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done 
0	mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
0	are windows to my breast where through the sun
0	delights to peep to gaze therein on thee 
0	yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art 
0	they draw but what they see know not the heart 
0	let those who are in favour with their stars
0	of public honour and proud titles boast 
0	whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
0	unlook d for joy in that i honour most 
0	great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
0	but as the marigold at the sun s eye 
0	and in themselves their pride lies buried 
0	for at a frown they in their glory die 
0	the painful warrior famoused for fight 
0	after a thousand victories once foil d 
0	is from the book of honour razed quite 
0	and all the rest forgot for which he toil d 
0	then happy i that love and am belov d 
0	where i may not remove nor be remov d 
0	lord of my love to whom in vassalage
0	thy merit hath my duty strongly knit 
0	to thee i send this written embassage 
0	to witness duty not to show my wit 
0	duty so great which wit so poor as mine
0	may make seem bare in wanting words to show it 
0	but that i hope some good conceit of thine
0	in thy soul s thought all naked will bestow it 
0	till whatsoever star that guides my moving 
0	points on me graciously with fair aspect 
0	and puts apparel on my tatter d loving 
0	to show me worthy of thy sweet respect 
0	then may i dare to boast how i do love thee 
0	till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me 
0	weary with toil i haste me to my bed 
0	the dear respose for limbs with travel tir d 
0	but then begins a journey in my head
0	to work my mind when body s work s expired 
0	for then my thoughts from far where i abide 
0	intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee 
0	and keep my drooping eyelids open wide 
0	looking on darkness which the blind do see 
0	save that my soul s imaginary sight
0	presents thy shadow to my sightless view 
0	makes black night beauteous and her old face new 
0	lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind 
0	for thee and for myself no quiet find 
0	how can i then return in happy plight 
0	that am debarre d the benefit of rest 
0	when day s oppression is not eas d by night 
0	but day by night and night by day oppress d 
0	and each though enemies to either s reign 
0	do in consent shake hands to torture me 
0	the one by toil the other to complain
0	how far i toil still farther off from thee 
0	i tell the day to please him thou art bright 
0	and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven 
0	so flatter i the swart complexion d night 
0	when sparkling stars twire not thou gild st the even 
0	but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer 
0	and night doth nightly make grief s length seem stronger 
0	when in disgrace with fortune and men s eyes
0	i all alone beweep my outcast state 
0	and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries 
0	and look upon myself and curse my fate 
0	wishing me like to one more rich in hope 
0	featur d like him like him with friends possess d 
0	desiring this man s art and that man s scope 
0	with what i most enjoy contented least 
0	yet in these thoughts my self almost despising 
0	haply i think on thee and then my state 
0	like to the lark at break of day arising
0	from sullen earth sings hymns at heaven s gate 
0	for thy sweet love remember d such wealth brings
0	that then i scorn to change my state with kings 
0	when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
0	i summon up remembrance of things past 
0	i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought 
0	and with old woes new wail my dear time s waste 
0	then can i drown an eye unused to flow 
0	for precious friends hid in death s dateless night 
0	and weep afresh love s long since cancell d woe 
0	and moan the expense of many a vanish d sight 
0	then can i grieve at grievances foregone 
0	and heavily from woe to woe tell o er
0	the sad account of fore bemoaned moan 
0	which i new pay as if not paid before 
0	but if the while i think on thee dear friend 
0	all losses are restor d and sorrows end 
0	thy bosom is endeared with all hearts 
0	which i by lacking have supposed dead 
0	and there reigns love and all love s loving parts 
0	and all those friends which i thought buried 
0	how many a holy and obsequious tear
0	hath dear religious love stol n from mine eye 
0	as interest of the dead which now appear
0	but things remov d that hidden in thee lie 
0	thou art the grave where buried love doth live 
0	hung with the trophies of my lovers gone 
0	who all their parts of me to thee did give 
0	that due of many now is thine alone 
0	their images i lov d i view in thee 
0	and thou all they hast all the all of me 
0	if thou survive my well contented day 
0	when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
0	and shalt by fortune once more re survey
0	these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover 
0	compare them with the bett ring of the time 
0	and though they be outstripp d by every pen 
0	reserve them for my love not for their rhyme 
0	exceeded by the height of happier men 
0	o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought 
0	 had my friend s muse grown with this growing age 
0	a dearer birth than this his love had brought 
0	to march in ranks of better equipage 
0	but since he died and poets better prove 
0	theirs for their style i ll read his for his love 
0	full many a glorious morning have i seen
0	flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye 
0	kissing with golden face the meadows green 
0	gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy 
0	anon permit the basest clouds to ride
0	with ugly rack on his celestial face 
0	and from the forlorn world his visage hide 
0	stealing unseen to west with this disgrace 
0	even so my sun one early morn did shine 
0	with all triumphant splendour on my brow 
0	but out alack he was but one hour mine 
0	the region cloud hath mask d him from me now 
0	yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth 
0	suns of the world may stain when heaven s sun staineth 
0	why didst thou promise such a beauteous day 
0	and make me travel forth without my cloak 
0	to let base clouds o ertake me in my way 
0	hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke 
0	 tis not enough that through the cloud thou break 
0	to dry the rain on my storm beaten face 
0	for no man well of such a salve can speak 
0	that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace 
0	nor can thy shame give physic to my grief 
0	though thou repent yet i have still the loss 
0	the offender s sorrow lends but weak relief
0	to him that bears the strong offence s cross 
0	ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds 
0	and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds 
0	no more be griev d at that which thou hast done 
0	roses have thorns and silver fountains mud 
0	clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun 
0	and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud 
0	all men make faults and even i in this 
0	authorizing thy trespass with compare 
0	myself corrupting salving thy amiss 
0	excusing thy sins more than thy sins are 
0	for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense 
0	thy adverse party is thy advocate 
0	and gainst myself a lawful plea commence 
0	such civil war is in my love and hate 
0	that i an accessary needs must be 
0	to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me 
0	let me confess that we two must be twain 
0	although our undivided loves are one 
0	so shall those blots that do with me remain 
0	without thy help by me be borne alone 
0	in our two loves there is but one respect 
0	though in our lives a separable spite 
0	which though it alter not love s sole effect 
0	yet doth it steal sweet hours from love s delight 
0	i may not evermore acknowledge thee 
0	lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame 
0	nor thou with public kindness honour me 
0	unless thou take that honour from thy name 
0	but do not so i love thee in such sort 
0	as thou being mine mine is thy good report 
0	as a decrepit father takes delight
0	to see his active child do deeds of youth 
0	so i made lame by fortune s dearest spite 
0	take all my comfort of thy worth and truth 
0	for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit 
0	or any of these all or all or more 
0	entitled in thy parts do crowned sit 
0	i make my love engrafted to this store 
0	so then i am not lame poor nor despis d 
0	whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
0	that i in thy abundance am suffic d 
0	and by a part of all thy glory live 
0	look what is best that best i wish in thee 
0	this wish i have then ten times happy me 
0	how can my muse want subject to invent 
0	while thou dost breathe that pour st into my verse
0	thine own sweet argument too excellent
0	for every vulgar paper to rehearse 
0	o give thy self the thanks if aught in me
0	worthy perusal stand against thy sight 
0	when thou thy self dost give invention light 
0	be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
0	than those old nine which rhymers invocate 
0	and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
0	eternal numbers to outlive long date 
0	if my slight muse do please these curious days 
0	the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise 
0	o how thy worth with manners may i sing 
0	when thou art all the better part of me 
0	what can mine own praise to mine own self bring 
0	and what is t but mine own when i praise thee 
0	even for this let us divided live 
0	and our dear love lose name of single one 
0	that by this separation i may give
0	that due to thee which thou deserv st alone 
0	o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove 
0	were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave 
0	to entertain the time with thoughts of love 
0	which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive 
0	and that thou teachest how to make one twain 
0	by praising him here who doth hence remain 
0	take all my loves my love yea take them all 
0	what hast thou then more than thou hadst before 
0	no love my love that thou mayst true love call 
0	all mine was thine before thou hadst this more 
0	then if for my love thou my love receivest 
0	i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest 
0	but yet be blam d if thou thy self deceivest
0	by wilful taste of what thyself refusest 
0	i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief 
0	although thou steal thee all my poverty 
0	and yet love knows it is a greater grief
0	to bear love s wrong than hate s known injury 
0	lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows 
0	kill me with spites yet we must not be foes 
0	those pretty wrongs that liberty commits 
0	when i am sometime absent from thy heart 
0	thy beauty and thy years full well befits 
0	for still temptation follows where thou art 
0	gentle thou art and therefore to be won 
0	beauteous thou art therefore to be assail d 
0	and when a woman woos what woman s son
0	will sourly leave her till he have prevail d 
0	ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear 
0	and chide thy beauty and thy straying youth 
0	who lead thee in their riot even there
0	where thou art forced to break a twofold truth 
0	hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee 
0	thine by thy beauty being false to me 
0	that thou hast her it is not all my grief 
0	and yet it may be said i loved her dearly 
0	that she hath thee is of my wailing chief 
0	a loss in love that touches me more nearly 
0	loving offenders thus i will excuse ye 
0	thou dost love her because thou know st i love her 
0	and for my sake even so doth she abuse me 
0	suffering my friend for my sake to approve her 
0	if i lose thee my loss is my love s gain 
0	and losing her my friend hath found that loss 
0	both find each other and i lose both twain 
0	and both for my sake lay on me this cross 
0	but here s the joy my friend and i are one 
0	sweet flattery then she loves but me alone 
0	when most i wink then do mine eyes best see 
0	for all the day they view things unrespected 
0	but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee 
0	and darkly bright are bright in dark directed 
0	then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright 
0	how would thy shadow s form form happy show
0	to the clear day with thy much clearer light 
0	when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so 
0	how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
0	by looking on thee in the living day 
0	when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
0	through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay 
0	all days are nights to see till i see thee 
0	and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me 
0	if the dull substance of my flesh were thought 
0	injurious distance should not stop my way 
0	for then despite of space i would be brought 
0	from limits far remote where thou dost stay 
0	no matter then although my foot did stand
0	upon the farthest earth remov d from thee 
0	for nimble thought can jump both sea and land 
0	as soon as think the place where he would be 
0	but ah thought kills me that i am not thought 
0	to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone 
0	but that so much of earth and water wrought 
0	i must attend time s leisure with my moan 
0	receiving nought by elements so slow
0	but heavy tears badges of either s woe 
0	the other two slight air and purging fire
0	are both with thee wherever i abide 
0	the first my thought the other my desire 
0	these present absent with swift motion slide 
0	for when these quicker elements are gone
0	in tender embassy of love to thee 
0	my life being made of four with two alone
0	sinks down to death oppress d with melancholy 
0	until life s composition be recur d
0	by those swift messengers return d from thee 
0	who even but now come back again assur d 
0	of thy fair health recounting it to me 
0	this told i joy but then no longer glad 
0	i send them back again and straight grow sad 
0	mine eye and heart are at a mortal war 
0	how to divide the conquest of thy sight 
0	mine eye my heart thy picture s sight would bar 
0	my heart mine eye the freedom of that right 
0	my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie 
0	a closet never pierc d with crystal eyes 
0	but the defendant doth that plea deny 
0	and says in him thy fair appearance lies 
0	to side this title is impannelled
0	a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart 
0	and by their verdict is determined
0	the clear eye s moiety and the dear heart s part 
0	as thus mine eye s due is thy outward part 
0	and my heart s right thy inward love of heart 
0	betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took 
0	and each doth good turns now unto the other 
0	when that mine eye is famish d for a look 
0	or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother 
0	with my love s picture then my eye doth feast 
0	and to the painted banquet bids my heart 
0	another time mine eye is my heart s guest 
0	and in his thoughts of love doth share a part 
0	so either by thy picture or my love 
0	thy self away art present still with me 
0	for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move 
0	and i am still with them and they with thee 
0	or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
0	awakes my heart to heart s and eye s delight 
0	how careful was i when i took my way 
0	each trifle under truest bars to thrust 
0	that to my use it might unused stay
0	from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust 
0	most worthy comfort now my greatest grief 
0	thou best of dearest and mine only care 
0	art left the prey of every vulgar thief 
0	that thereby beauty s rose might never die 
0	thee have i not lock d up in any chest 
0	save where thou art not though i feel thou art 
0	within the gentle closure of my breast 
0	from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part 
0	and even thence thou wilt be stol n i fear 
0	for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear 
0	against that time if ever that time come 
0	when i shall see thee frown on my defects 
0	when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum 
0	call d to that audit by advis d respects 
0	against that time when thou shalt strangely pass 
0	and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye 
0	when love converted from the thing it was 
0	shall reasons find of settled gravity 
0	against that time do i ensconce me here 
0	within the knowledge of mine own desert 
0	and this my hand against my self uprear 
0	to guard the lawful reasons on thy part 
0	to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws 
0	since why to love i can allege no cause 
0	how heavy do i journey on the way 
0	when what i seek my weary travel s end 
0	doth teach that ease and that repose to say 
0	 thus far the miles are measured from thy friend 
0	the beast that bears me tired with my woe 
0	plods dully on to bear that weight in me 
0	as if by some instinct the wretch did know
0	his rider lov d not speed being made from thee 
0	the bloody spur cannot provoke him on 
0	that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide 
0	which heavily he answers with a groan 
0	more sharp to me than spurring to his side 
0	for that same groan doth put this in my mind 
0	my grief lies onward and my joy behind 
0	thus can my love excuse the slow offence
0	of my dull bearer when from thee i speed 
0	from where thou art why should i haste me thence 
0	till i return of posting is no need 
0	o what excuse will my poor beast then find 
0	when swift extremity can seem but slow 
0	then should i spur though mounted on the wind 
0	in winged speed n motion shall i know 
0	then can no horse with my desire keep pace 
0	therefore desire of perfect st love being made 
0	shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race 
0	but love for love thus shall excuse my jade 
0	 since from thee going he went wilful slow 
0	towards thee i ll run and give him leave to go 
0	so am i as the rich whose blessed key 
0	can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure 
0	the which he will not every hour survey 
0	for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure 
0	therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare 
0	since seldom coming in that long year set 
0	like stones of worth they thinly placed are 
0	so is the time that keeps you as my chest 
0	or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide 
0	to make some special instant special blest 
0	by new unfolding his imprison d pride 
0	blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope 
0	being had to triumph being lacked to hope 
0	what is your substance whereof are you made 
0	that millions of strange shadows on you tend 
0	since every one hath every one one shade 
0	and you but one can every shadow lend 
0	describe adonis and the counterfeit
0	is poorly imitated after you 
0	on helen s cheek all art of beauty set 
0	and you in grecian tires are painted new 
0	speak of the spring and foison of the year 
0	the one doth shadow of your beauty show 
0	the other as your bounty doth appear 
0	and you in every blessed shape we know 
0	in all external grace you have some part 
0	but you like none none you for constant heart 
0	o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
0	by that sweet ornament which truth doth give 
0	the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
0	for that sweet odour which doth in it live 
0	the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
0	as the perfumed tincture of the roses 
0	hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
0	when summer s breath their masked buds discloses 
0	but for their virtue only is their show 
0	they live unwoo d and unrespected fade 
0	die to themselves sweet roses do not so 
0	of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made 
0	and so of you beauteous and lovely youth 
0	when that shall vade by verse distills your truth 
0	not marble nor the gilded monuments
0	of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme 
0	but you shall shine more bright in these contents
0	when wasteful war shall statues overturn 
0	and broils root out the work of masonry 
0	nor mars his sword nor war s quick fire shall burn
0	the living record of your memory 
0	 gainst death and all oblivious enmity
0	shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
0	even in the eyes of all posterity
0	that wear this world out to the ending doom 
0	so till the judgment that yourself arise 
0	you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes 
0	sweet love renew thy force be it not said
0	thy edge should blunter be than appetite 
0	which but to day by feeding is allay d 
0	to morrow sharpened in his former might 
0	so love be thou although to day thou fill
0	thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness 
0	to morrow see again and do not kill
0	the spirit of love with a perpetual dulness 
0	let this sad interim like the ocean be
0	which parts the shore where two contracted new
0	come daily to the banks that when they see
0	return of love more blest may be the view 
0	or call it winter which being full of care 
0	makes summer s welcome thrice more wished more rare 
0	being your slave what should i do but tend 
0	upon the hours and times of your desire 
0	i have no precious time at all to spend 
0	nor services to do till you require 
0	nor dare i chide the world without end hour 
0	whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you 
0	nor think the bitterness of absence sour 
0	when you have bid your servant once adieu 
0	nor dare i question with my jealous thought
0	where you may be or your affairs suppose 
0	but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
0	save where you are how happy you make those 
0	so true a fool is love that in your will 
0	though you do anything he thinks no ill 
0	that god forbid that made me first your slave 
0	i should in thought control your times of pleasure 
0	or at your hand the account of hours to crave 
0	being your vassal bound to stay your leisure 
0	o let me suffer being at your beck 
0	the imprison d absence of your liberty 
0	and patience tame to sufferance bide each check 
0	without accusing you of injury 
0	be where you list your charter is so strong
0	that you yourself may privilage your time
0	to what you will to you it doth belong
0	yourself to pardon of self doing crime 
0	i am to wait though waiting so be hell 
0	not blame your pleasure be it ill or well 
0	if there be nothing new but that which is
0	hath been before how are our brains beguil d 
0	which labouring for invention bear amiss
0	the second burthen of a former child 
0	o that record could with a backward look 
0	even of five hundred courses of the sun 
0	show me your image in some antique book 
0	since mind at first in character was done 
0	that i might see what the old world could say
0	to this composed wonder of your frame 
0	wh r we are mended or wh r better they 
0	or whether revolution be the same 
0	o sure i am the wits of former days 
0	to subjects worse have given admiring praise 
0	like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore 
0	so do our minutes hasten to their end 
0	each changing place with that which goes before 
0	in sequent toil all forwards do contend 
0	nativity once in the main of light 
0	crawls to maturity wherewith being crown d 
0	crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight 
0	and time that gave doth now his gift confound 
0	time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
0	and delves the parallels in beauty s brow 
0	feeds on the rarities of nature s truth 
0	and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow 
0	and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand 
0	praising thy worth despite his cruel hand 
0	is it thy will thy image should keep open
0	my heavy eyelids to the weary night 
0	dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken 
0	while shadows like to thee do mock my sight 
0	is it thy spirit that thou send st from thee
0	so far from home into my deeds to pry 
0	to find out shames and idle hours in me 
0	the scope and tenure of thy jealousy 
0	o no thy love though much is not so great 
0	it is my love that keeps mine eye awake 
0	mine own true love that doth my rest defeat 
0	to play the watchman ever for thy sake 
0	for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere 
0	from me far off with others all too near 
0	sin of self love possesseth all mine eye
0	and all my soul and all my every part 
0	and for this sin there is no remedy 
0	it is so grounded inward in my heart 
0	methinks no face so gracious is as mine 
0	no shape so true no truth of such account 
0	and for myself mine own worth do define 
0	as i all other in all worths surmount 
0	but when my glass shows me myself indeed
0	beated and chopp d with tanned antiquity 
0	mine own self love quite contrary i read 
0	self so self loving were iniquity 
0	 tis thee myself that for myself i praise 
0	painting my age with beauty of thy days 
0	against my love shall be as i am now 
0	with time s injurious hand crush d and o erworn 
0	when hours have drain d his blood and fill d his brow
0	with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
0	hath travell d on to age s steepy night 
0	and all those beauties whereof now he s king
0	are vanishing or vanished out of sight 
0	stealing away the treasure of his spring 
0	for such a time do i now fortify
0	against confounding age s cruel knife 
0	that he shall never cut from memory
0	my sweet love s beauty though my lover s life 
0	his beauty shall in these black lines be seen 
0	and they shall live and he in them still green 
0	when i have seen by time s fell hand defac d
0	the rich proud cost of outworn buried age 
0	when sometime lofty towers i see down raz d 
0	and brass eternal slave to mortal rage 
0	when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
0	advantage on the kingdom of the shore 
0	and the firm soil win of the watery main 
0	increasing store with loss and loss with store 
0	when i have seen such interchange of state 
0	or state itself confounded to decay 
0	ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate 
0	that time will come and take my love away 
0	this thought is as a death which cannot choose
0	but weep to have that which it fears to lose 
0	since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea 
0	but sad mortality o ersways their power 
0	how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea 
0	whose action is no stronger than a flower 
0	o how shall summer s honey breath hold out 
0	against the wrackful siege of battering days 
0	when rocks impregnable are not so stout 
0	nor gates of steel so strong but time decays 
0	o fearful meditation where alack 
0	or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back 
0	or who his spoil of beauty can forbid 
0	o none unless this miracle have might 
0	that in black ink my love may still shine bright 
0	tired with all these for restful death i cry 
0	as to behold desert a beggar born 
0	and needy nothing trimm d in jollity 
0	and purest faith unhappily forsworn 
0	and gilded honour shamefully misplac d 
0	and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted 
0	and right perfection wrongfully disgrac d 
0	and strength by limping sway disabled
0	and art made tongue tied by authority 
0	and folly doctor like controlling skill 
0	and simple truth miscall d simplicity 
0	and captive good attending captain ill 
0	tir d with all these from these would i be gone 
0	save that to die i leave my love alone 
0	ah wherefore with infection should he live 
0	and with his presence grace impiety 
0	that sin by him advantage should achieve 
0	and lace itself with his society 
0	why should false painting imitate his cheek 
0	and steel dead seeming of his living hue 
0	why should poor beauty indirectly seek
0	roses of shadow since his rose is true 
0	why should he live now nature bankrupt is 
0	beggar d of blood to blush through lively veins 
0	for she hath no exchequer now but his 
0	and proud of many lives upon his gains 
0	o him she stores to show what wealth she had
0	in days long since before these last so bad 
0	thus is his cheek the map of days outworn 
0	when beauty lived and died as flowers do now 
0	or durst inhabit on a living brow 
0	before the golden tresses of the dead 
0	the right of sepulchres were shorn away 
0	to live a second life on second head 
0	ere beauty s dead fleece made another gay 
0	in him those holy antique hours are seen 
0	without all ornament itself and true 
0	making no summer of another s green 
0	robbing no old to dress his beauty new 
0	and him as for a map doth nature store 
0	to show false art what beauty was of yore 
0	those parts of thee that the world s eye doth view
0	want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend 
0	all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due 
0	uttering bare truth even so as foes commend 
0	thy outward thus with outward praise is crown d 
0	but those same tongues that give thee so thine own 
0	in other accents do this praise confound
0	by seeing farther than the eye hath shown 
0	they look into the beauty of thy mind 
0	and that in guess they measure by thy deeds 
0	then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind 
0	to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds 
0	but why thy odour matcheth not thy show 
0	the soil is this that thou dost common grow 
0	that thou art blam d shall not be thy defect 
0	for slander s mark was ever yet the fair 
0	the ornament of beauty is suspect 
0	a crow that flies in heaven s sweetest air 
0	so thou be good slander doth but approve
0	thy worth the greater being woo d of time 
0	for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love 
0	and thou present st a pure unstained prime 
0	thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
0	either not assail d or victor being charg d 
0	yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise 
0	to tie up envy evermore enlarg d 
0	if some suspect of ill mask d not thy show 
0	then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe 
0	no longer mourn for me when i am dead
0	than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
0	give warning to the world that i am fled
0	from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell 
0	nay if you read this line remember not
0	the hand that writ it for i love you so 
0	that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot 
0	if thinking on me then should make you woe 
0	o if i say you look upon this verse 
0	when i perhaps compounded am with clay 
0	do not so much as my poor name rehearse 
0	but let your love even with my life decay 
0	lest the wise world should look into your moan 
0	and mock you with me after i am gone 
0	o lest the world should task you to recite
0	what merit lived in me that you should love
0	after my death dear love forget me quite 
0	for you in me can nothing worthy prove 
0	unless you would devise some virtuous lie 
0	to do more for me than mine own desert 
0	and hang more praise upon deceased i
0	o lest your true love may seem false in this
0	that you for love speak well of me untrue 
0	my name be buried where my body is 
0	and live no more to shame nor me nor you 
0	for i am shamed by that which i bring forth 
0	and so should you to love things nothing worth 
0	that time of year thou mayst in me behold
0	when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
0	upon those boughs which shake against the cold 
0	bare ruin d choirs where late the sweet birds sang 
0	in me thou see st the twilight of such day
0	as after sunset fadeth in the west 
0	which by and by black night doth take away 
0	death s second self that seals up all in rest 
0	in me thou see st the glowing of such fire 
0	that on the ashes of his youth doth lie 
0	as the death bed whereon it must expire 
0	consum d with that which it was nourish d by 
0	this thou perceiv st which makes thy love more strong 
0	to love that well which thou must leave ere long 
0	but be contented when that fell arrest
0	without all bail shall carry me away 
0	my life hath in this line some interest 
0	which for memorial still with thee shall stay 
0	when thou reviewest this thou dost review
0	the very part was consecrate to thee 
0	the earth can have but earth which is his due 
0	my spirit is thine the better part of me 
0	so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life 
0	the prey of worms my body being dead 
0	the coward conquest of a wretch s knife 
0	too base of thee to be remembered 
0	the worth of that is that which it contains 
0	and that is this and this with thee remains 
0	so are you to my thoughts as food to life 
0	or as sweet season d showers are to the ground 
0	and for the peace of you i hold such strife
0	as twixt a miser and his wealth is found 
0	now proud as an enjoyer and anon
0	doubting the filching age will steal his treasure 
0	now counting best to be with you alone 
0	then better d that the world may see my pleasure 
0	sometime all full with feasting on your sight 
0	and by and by clean starved for a look 
0	possessing or pursuing no delight 
0	save what is had or must from you be took 
0	thus do i pine and surfeit day by day 
0	or gluttoning on all or all away 
0	why is my verse so barren of new pride 
0	so far from variation or quick change 
0	from fairest creatures we desire increase 
0	why with the time do i not glance aside
0	to new found methods and to compounds strange 
0	why write i still all one ever the same 
0	and keep invention in a noted weed 
0	that every word doth almost tell my name 
0	showing their birth and where they did proceed 
0	o know sweet love i always write of you 
0	and you and love are still my argument 
0	so all my best is dressing old words new 
0	spending again what is already spent 
0	for as the sun is daily new and old 
0	so is my love still telling what is told 
0	thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear 
0	thy dial how thy precious minutes waste 
0	these vacant leaves thy mind s imprint will bear 
0	and of this book this learning mayst thou taste 
0	the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
0	of mouthed graves will give thee memory 
0	thou by thy dial s shady stealth mayst know
0	time s thievish progress to eternity 
0	look what thy memory cannot contain 
0	commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
0	those children nursed deliver d from thy brain 
0	to take a new acquaintance of thy mind 
0	these offices so oft as thou wilt look 
0	shall profit thee and much enrich thy book 
0	so oft have i invoked thee for my muse 
0	and found such fair assistance in my verse
0	as every alien pen hath got my use
0	and under thee their poesy disperse 
0	and heavy ignorance aloft to fly 
0	have added feathers to the learned s wing
0	and given grace a double majesty 
0	yet be most proud of that which i compile 
0	whose influence is thine and born of thee 
0	in others works thou dost but mend the style 
0	and arts with thy sweet graces graced be 
0	but thou art all my art and dost advance
0	as high as learning my rude ignorance 
0	whilst i alone did call upon thy aid 
0	my verse alone had all thy gentle grace 
0	but now my gracious numbers are decay d 
0	and my sick muse doth give an other place 
0	i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
0	deserves the travail of a worthier pen 
0	yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
0	he robs thee of and pays it thee again 
0	he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
0	from thy behaviour beauty doth he give 
0	and found it in thy cheek he can afford
0	no praise to thee but what in thee doth live 
0	then thank him not for that which he doth say 
0	since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay 
0	o how i faint when i of you do write 
0	knowing a better spirit doth use your name 
0	and in the praise thereof spends all his might 
0	to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame 
0	but since your worth wide as the ocean is 
0	the humble as the proudest sail doth bear 
0	my saucy bark inferior far to his 
0	on your broad main doth wilfully appear 
0	your shallowest help will hold me up afloat 
0	whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride 
0	or being wrack d i am a worthless boat 
0	he of tall building and of goodly pride 
0	then if he thrive and i be cast away 
0	the worst was this my love was my decay 
0	or i shall live your epitaph to make 
0	or you survive when i in earth am rotten 
0	from hence your memory death cannot take 
0	although in me each part will be forgotten 
0	your name from hence immortal life shall have 
0	though i once gone to all the world must die 
0	the earth can yield me but a common grave 
0	when you entombed in men s eyes shall lie 
0	your monument shall be my gentle verse 
0	which eyes not yet created shall o er read 
0	and tongues to be your being shall rehearse 
0	when all the breathers of this world are dead 
0	you still shall live such virtue hath my pen 
0	where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men 
0	i grant thou wert not married to my muse 
0	and therefore mayst without attaint o erlook
0	the dedicated words which writers use
0	of their fair subject blessing every book 
0	thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue 
0	finding thy worth a limit past my praise 
0	and therefore art enforced to seek anew
0	some fresher stamp of the time bettering days 
0	and do so love yet when they have devis d 
0	what strained touches rhetoric can lend 
0	thou truly fair wert truly sympathiz d
0	in true plain words by thy true telling friend 
0	and their gross painting might be better us d
0	where cheeks need blood in thee it is abus d 
0	i never saw that you did painting need 
0	and therefore to your fair no painting set 
0	i found or thought i found you did exceed
0	that barren tender of a poet s debt 
0	and therefore have i slept in your report 
0	that you yourself being extant well might show
0	how far a modern quill doth come too short 
0	speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow 
0	this silence for my sin you did impute 
0	for i impair not beauty being mute 
0	when others would give life and bring a tomb 
0	there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
0	than both your poets can in praise devise 
0	who is it that says most which can say more 
0	than this rich praise that you alone are you 
0	in whose confine immured is the store
0	which should example where your equal grew 
0	lean penury within that pen doth dwell
0	that to his subject lends not some small glory 
0	but he that writes of you if he can tell
0	that you are you so dignifies his story 
0	let him but copy what in you is writ 
0	not making worse what nature made so clear 
0	and such a counterpart shall fame his wit 
0	making his style admired every where 
0	you to your beauteous blessings add a curse 
0	being fond on praise which makes your praises worse 
0	my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still 
0	while comments of your praise richly compil d 
0	reserve their character with golden quill 
0	and precious phrase by all the muses fil d 
0	i think good thoughts whilst others write good words 
0	and like unlettered clerk still cry amen 
0	to every hymn that able spirit affords 
0	in polish d form of well refined pen 
0	hearing you praised i say tis so tis true 
0	and to the most of praise add something more 
0	but that is in my thought whose love to you 
0	though words come hindmost holds his rank before 
0	then others for the breath of words respect 
0	was it the proud full sail of his great verse 
0	bound for the prize of all too precious you 
0	that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse 
0	making their tomb the womb wherein they grew 
0	was it his spirit by spirits taught to write 
0	above a mortal pitch that struck me dead 
0	no neither he nor his compeers by night
0	giving him aid my verse astonished 
0	he nor that affable familiar ghost
0	which nightly gulls him with intelligence 
0	as victors of my silence cannot boast 
0	i was not sick of any fear from thence 
0	but when your countenance fill d up his line 
0	then lacked i matter that enfeebled mine 
0	farewell thou art too dear for my possessing 
0	and like enough thou know st thy estimate 
0	the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing 
0	my bonds in thee are all determinate 
0	for how do i hold thee but by thy granting 
0	and for that riches where is my deserving 
0	the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting 
0	and so my patent back again is swerving 
0	thy self thou gav st thy own worth then not knowing 
0	or me to whom thou gav st it else mistaking 
0	so thy great gift upon misprision growing 
0	comes home again on better judgement making 
0	thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter 
0	in sleep a king but waking no such matter 
0	when thou shalt be dispos d to set me light 
0	and place my merit in the eye of scorn 
0	upon thy side against myself i ll fight 
0	and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn 
0	with mine own weakness being best acquainted 
0	upon thy part i can set down a story
0	of faults conceal d wherein i am attainted 
0	that thou in losing me shalt win much glory 
0	and i by this will be a gainer too 
0	for bending all my loving thoughts on thee 
0	the injuries that to myself i do 
0	doing thee vantage double vantage me 
0	such is my love to thee i so belong 
0	that for thy right myself will bear all wrong 
0	say that thou didst forsake me for some fault 
0	and i will comment upon that offence 
0	speak of my lameness and i straight will halt 
0	against thy reasons making no defence 
0	thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill 
0	to set a form upon desired change 
0	as i ll myself disgrace knowing thy will 
0	i will acquaintance strangle and look strange 
0	be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
0	thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell 
0	lest i too much profane should do it wrong 
0	and haply of our old acquaintance tell 
0	for thee against my self i ll vow debate 
0	for i must ne er love him whom thou dost hate 
0	then hate me when thou wilt if ever now 
0	now while the world is bent my deeds to cross 
0	join with the spite of fortune make me bow 
0	and do not drop in for an after loss 
0	ah do not when my heart hath scap d this sorrow 
0	come in the rearward of a conquer d woe 
0	give not a windy night a rainy morrow 
0	to linger out a purpos d overthrow 
0	if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last 
0	when other petty griefs have done their spite 
0	but in the onset come so shall i taste
0	at first the very worst of fortune s might 
0	and other strains of woe which now seem woe 
0	compar d with loss of thee will not seem so 
0	some glory in their birth some in their skill 
0	some in their wealth some in their body s force 
0	some in their garments though new fangled ill 
0	some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse 
0	and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure 
0	wherein it finds a joy above the rest 
0	but these particulars are not my measure 
0	all these i better in one general best 
0	thy love is better than high birth to me 
0	richer than wealth prouder than garments costs 
0	of more delight than hawks and horses be 
0	and having thee of all men s pride i boast 
0	wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
0	all this away and me most wretchcd make 
0	but do thy worst to steal thyself away 
0	for term of life thou art assured mine 
0	and life no longer than thy love will stay 
0	for it depends upon that love of thine 
0	then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs 
0	when in the least of them my life hath end 
0	i see a better state to me belongs
0	than that which on thy humour doth depend 
0	thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind 
0	since that my life on thy revolt doth lie 
0	o what a happy title do i find 
0	happy to have thy love happy to die 
0	but what s so blessed fair that fears no blot 
0	thou mayst be false and yet i know it not 
0	so shall i live supposing thou art true 
0	like a deceived husband so love s face
0	may still seem love to me though alter d new 
0	thy looks with me thy heart in other place 
0	for there can live no hatred in thine eye 
0	therefore in that i cannot know thy change 
0	in many s looks the false heart s history
0	is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange 
0	but heaven in thy creation did decree
0	that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell 
0	whate er thy thoughts or thy heart s workings be 
0	thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell 
0	how like eve s apple doth thy beauty grow 
0	if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show 
0	they that have power to hurt and will do none 
0	that do not do the thing they most do show 
0	who moving others are themselves as stone 
0	unmoved cold and to temptation slow 
0	they rightly do inherit heaven s graces 
0	and husband nature s riches from expense 
0	they are the lords and owners of their faces 
0	others but stewards of their excellence 
0	the summer s flower is to the summer sweet 
0	though to itself it only live and die 
0	but if that flower with base infection meet 
0	the basest weed outbraves his dignity 
0	for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds 
0	lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds 
0	how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
0	which like a canker in the fragrant rose 
0	doth spot the beauty of thy budding name 
0	o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose 
0	that tongue that tells the story of thy days 
0	making lascivious comments on thy sport 
0	cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise 
0	naming thy name blesses an ill report 
0	o what a mansion have those vices got
0	which for their habitation chose out thee 
0	where beauty s veil doth cover every blot
0	and all things turns to fair that eyes can see 
0	take heed dear heart of this large privilege 
0	the hardest knife ill us d doth lose his edge 
0	some say thy fault is youth some wantonness 
0	some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport 
0	both grace and faults are lov d of more and less 
0	thou mak st faults graces that to thee resort 
0	as on the finger of a throned queen
0	so are those errors that in thee are seen
0	to truths translated and for true things deem d 
0	how many lambs might the stern wolf betray 
0	if like a lamb he could his looks translate 
0	how many gazers mightst thou lead away 
0	if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state 
0	but do not so i love thee in such sort 
0	as thou being mine mine is thy good report 
0	how like a winter hath my absence been
0	from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year 
0	what freezings have i felt what dark days seen 
0	what old december s bareness everywhere 
0	and yet this time removed was summer s time 
0	the teeming autumn big with rich increase 
0	bearing the wanton burden of the prime 
0	like widow d wombs after their lords decease 
0	yet this abundant issue seem d to me
0	but hope of orphans and unfather d fruit 
0	for summer and his pleasures wait on thee 
0	and thou away the very birds are mute 
0	or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer 
0	that leaves look pale dreading the winter s near 
0	from you have i been absent in the spring 
0	when proud pied april dress d in all his trim 
0	hath put a spirit of youth in every thing 
0	that heavy saturn laugh d and leap d with him 
0	yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
0	of different flowers in odour and in hue 
0	could make me any summer s story tell 
0	or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew 
0	nor did i wonder at the lily s white 
0	nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose 
0	they were but sweet but figures of delight 
0	drawn after you you pattern of all those 
0	yet seem d it winter still and you away 
0	as with your shadow i with these did play 
0	the forward violet thus did i chide 
0	sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells 
0	if not from my love s breath the purple pride
0	which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
0	in my love s veins thou hast too grossly dy d 
0	the lily i condemned for thy hand 
0	and buds of marjoram had stol n thy hair 
0	the roses fearfully on thorns did stand 
0	one blushing shame another white despair 
0	a third nor red nor white had stol n of both 
0	and to his robbery had annex d thy breath 
0	but for his theft in pride of all his growth
0	a vengeful canker eat him up to death 
0	more flowers i noted yet i none could see 
0	but sweet or colour it had stol n from thee 
0	where art thou muse that thou forget st so long 
0	to speak of that which gives thee all thy might 
0	spend st thou thy fury on some worthless song 
0	darkening thy power to lend base subjects light 
0	return forgetful muse and straight redeem 
0	in gentle numbers time so idly spent 
0	sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
0	and gives thy pen both skill and argument 
0	rise resty muse my love s sweet face survey 
0	if time have any wrinkle graven there 
0	if any be a satire to decay 
0	and make time s spoils despised every where 
0	give my love fame faster than time wastes life 
0	so thou prevent st his scythe and crooked knife 
0	o truant muse what shall be thy amends
0	for thy neglect of truth in beauty dy d 
0	both truth and beauty on my love depends 
0	so dost thou too and therein dignified 
0	make answer muse wilt thou not haply say 
0	 truth needs no colour with his colour fix d 
0	beauty no pencil beauty s truth to lay 
0	but best is best if never intermix d 
0	excuse not silence so for t lies in thee
0	to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
0	and to be prais d of ages yet to be 
0	then do thy office muse i teach thee how
0	to make him seem long hence as he shows now 
0	my love is strengthen d though more weak in seeming 
0	i love not less though less the show appear 
0	that love is merchandiz d whose rich esteeming 
0	the owner s tongue doth publish every where 
0	our love was new and then but in the spring 
0	when i was wont to greet it with my lays 
0	as philomel in summer s front doth sing 
0	and stops her pipe in growth of riper days 
0	not that the summer is less pleasant now
0	than when her mournful hymns did hush the night 
0	but that wild music burthens every bough 
0	and sweets grown common lose their dear delight 
0	therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue 
0	because i would not dull you with my song 
0	alack what poverty my muse brings forth 
0	that having such a scope to show her pride 
0	the argument all bare is of more worth
0	than when it hath my added praise beside 
0	o blame me not if i no more can write 
0	look in your glass and there appears a face
0	that over goes my blunt invention quite 
0	dulling my lines and doing me disgrace 
0	were it not sinful then striving to mend 
0	to mar the subject that before was well 
0	for to no other pass my verses tend
0	than of your graces and your gifts to tell 
0	and more much more than in my verse can sit 
0	your own glass shows you when you look in it 
0	to me fair friend you never can be old 
0	for as you were when first your eye i ey d 
0	such seems your beauty still three winters cold 
0	have from the forests shook three summers pride 
0	three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn d 
0	in process of the seasons have i seen 
0	three april perfumes in three hot junes burn d 
0	since first i saw you fresh which yet are green 
0	ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand 
0	steal from his figure and no pace perceiv d 
0	so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand 
0	hath motion and mine eye may be deceiv d 
0	for fear of which hear this thou age unbred 
0	ere you were born was beauty s summer dead 
0	let not my love be call d idolatry 
0	nor my beloved as an idol show 
0	since all alike my songs and praises be
0	to one of one still such and ever so 
0	kind is my love to day to morrow kind 
0	still constant in a wondrous excellence 
0	therefore my verse to constancy confin d 
0	one thing expressing leaves out difference 
0	 fair kind and true is all my argument 
0	 fair kind and true varying to other words 
0	and in this change is my invention spent 
0	three themes in one which wondrous scope affords 
0	fair kind and true have often liv d alone 
0	which three till now never kept seat in one 
0	when in the chronicle of wasted time
0	i see descriptions of the fairest wights 
0	and beauty making beautiful old rime 
0	in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights 
0	then in the blazon of sweet beauty s best 
0	of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow 
0	i see their antique pen would have express d
0	even such a beauty as you master now 
0	so all their praises are but prophecies
0	of this our time all you prefiguring 
0	and for they looked but with divining eyes 
0	they had not skill enough your worth to sing 
0	for we which now behold these present days 
0	have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise 
0	not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
0	of the wide world dreaming on things to come 
0	can yet the lease of my true love control 
0	supposed as forfeit to a confin d doom 
0	the mortal moon hath her eclipse endur d 
0	and the sad augurs mock their own presage 
0	incertainties now crown themselves assur d 
0	and peace proclaims olives of endless age 
0	now with the drops of this most balmy time 
0	my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes 
0	since spite of him i ll live in this poor rime 
0	while he insults o er dull and speechless tribes 
0	and thou in this shalt find thy monument 
0	when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent 
0	what s in the brain that ink may character 
0	which hath not figur d to thee my true spirit 
0	what s new to speak what now to register 
0	that may express my love or thy dear merit 
0	nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine 
0	i must each day say o er the very same 
0	counting no old thing old thou mine i thine 
0	even as when first i hallow d thy fair name 
0	so that eternal love in love s fresh case 
0	weighs not the dust and injury of age 
0	nor gives to necessary wrinkles place 
0	but makes antiquity for aye his page 
0	finding the first conceit of love there bred 
0	where time and outward form would show it dead 
0	o never say that i was false of heart 
0	though absence seem d my flame to qualify 
0	as easy might i from my self depart
0	as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie 
0	that is my home of love if i have rang d 
0	like him that travels i return again 
0	just to the time not with the time exchang d 
0	so that myself bring water for my stain 
0	never believe though in my nature reign d 
0	all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood 
0	that it could so preposterously be stain d 
0	to leave for nothing all thy sum of good 
0	for nothing this wide universe i call 
0	save thou my rose in it thou art my all 
0	alas tis true i have gone here and there 
0	and made my self a motley to the view 
0	gor d mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear 
0	made old offences of affections new 
0	most true it is that i have look d on truth
0	askance and strangely but by all above 
0	these blenches gave my heart another youth 
0	and worse essays prov d thee my best of love 
0	now all is done save what shall have no end 
0	mine appetite i never more will grind
0	on newer proof to try an older friend 
0	a god in love to whom i am confin d 
0	then give me welcome next my heaven the best 
0	even to thy pure and most most loving breast 
0	o for my sake do you with fortune chide 
0	the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds 
0	that did not better for my life provide
0	than public means which public manners breeds 
0	thence comes it that my name receives a brand 
0	and almost thence my nature is subdu d
0	to what it works in like the dyer s hand 
0	pity me then and wish i were renew d 
0	whilst like a willing patient i will drink 
0	potions of eisel gainst my strong infection 
0	no bitterness that i will bitter think 
0	nor double penance to correct correction 
0	pity me then dear friend and i assure ye 
0	even that your pity is enough to cure me 
0	your love and pity doth the impression fill 
0	which vulgar scandal stamp d upon my brow 
0	for what care i who calls me well or ill 
0	so you o er green my bad my good allow 
0	you are my all the world and i must strive
0	to know my shames and praises from your tongue 
0	none else to me nor i to none alive 
0	that my steel d sense or changes right or wrong 
0	in so profound abysm i throw all care
0	of others voices that my adder s sense
0	to critic and to flatterer stopped are 
0	mark how with my neglect i do dispense 
0	you are so strongly in my purpose bred 
0	that all the world besides methinks are dead 
0	since i left you mine eye is in my mind 
0	and that which governs me to go about
0	doth part his function and is partly blind 
0	seems seeing but effectually is out 
0	for it no form delivers to the heart
0	of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch 
0	of his quick objects hath the mind no part 
0	nor his own vision holds what it doth catch

0	my most true mind thus maketh mine untrue

0	drink up the monarch s plague this flattery 
0	or whether shall i say mine eye saith true 
0	and that your love taught it this alchemy 
0	to make of monsters and things indigest
0	such cherubins as your sweet self resemble 
0	creating every bad a perfect best 
0	as fast as objects to his beams assemble 
0	o tis the first tis flattery in my seeing 
0	and my great mind most kingly drinks it up 
0	mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing 
0	and to his palate doth prepare the cup 
0	if it be poison d tis the lesser sin
0	that mine eye loves it and doth first begin 
0	those lines that i before have writ do lie 
0	even those that said i could not love you dearer 
0	yet then my judgment knew no reason why
0	my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer 
0	but reckoning time whose million d accidents
0	creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings 
0	tan sacred beauty blunt the sharp st intents 
0	divert strong minds to the course of altering things 
0	alas why fearing of time s tyranny 
0	might i not then say now i love you best 
0	when i was certain o er incertainty 
0	crowning the present doubting of the rest 
0	love is a babe then might i not say so 
0	to give full growth to that which still doth grow 
0	let me not to the marriage of true minds
0	admit impediments love is not love
0	which alters when it alteration finds 
0	or bends with the remover to remove 
0	o no it is an ever fixed mark 
0	that looks on tempests and is never shaken 
0	it is the star to every wandering bark 
0	whose worth s unknown although his height be taken 
0	love s not time s fool though rosy lips and cheeks
0	within his bending sickle s compass come 
0	love alters not with his brief hours and weeks 
0	but bears it out even to the edge of doom 
0	if this be error and upon me prov d 
0	i never writ nor no man ever lov d 
0	accuse me thus that i have scanted all 
0	wherein i should your great deserts repay 
0	forgot upon your dearest love to call 
0	whereto all bonds do tie me day by day 
0	that i have frequent been with unknown minds 
0	and given to time your own dear purchas d right 
0	that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
0	which should transport me farthest from your sight 
0	book both my wilfulness and errors down

0	bring me within the level of your frown 
0	but shoot not at me in your waken d hate 
0	since my appeal says i did strive to prove
0	the constancy and virtue of your love 
0	like as to make our appetite more keen 
0	with eager compounds we our palate urge 
0	as to prevent our maladies unseen 
0	we sicken to shun sickness when we purge 
0	even so being full of your ne er cloying sweetness 
0	to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding 
0	and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
0	to be diseas d ere that there was true needing 
0	thus policy in love to anticipate
0	the ills that were not grew to faults assur d 
0	and brought to medicine a healthful state
0	which rank of goodness would by ill be cur d 
0	but thence i learn and find the lesson true 
0	drugs poison him that so fell sick of you 
0	what potions have i drunk of siren tears 
0	distill d from limbecks foul as hell within 
0	applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears 
0	still losing when i saw myself to win 
0	what wretched errors hath my heart committed 
0	whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never 
0	how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted 
0	in the distraction of this madding fever 
0	o benefit of ill now i find true
0	that better is by evil still made better 
0	and ruin d love when it is built anew 
0	grows fairer than at first more strong far greater 
0	so i return rebuk d to my content 
0	and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent 
0	that you were once unkind befriends me now 
0	and for that sorrow which i then did feel 
0	needs must i under my transgression bow 
0	unless my nerves were brass or hammer d steel 
0	for if you were by my unkindness shaken 
0	as i by yours you ve pass d a hell of time 
0	and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
0	to weigh how once i suffer d in your crime 
0	o that our night of woe might have remember d
0	my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits 
0	and soon to you as you to me then tender d
0	the humble salve which wounded bosoms fits 
0	but that your trespass now becomes a fee 
0	mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me 
0	 tis better to be vile than vile esteem d 
0	when not to be receives reproach of being 
0	and the just pleasure lost which is so deem d
0	not by our feeling but by others seeing 
0	for why should others false adulterate eyes
0	give salutation to my sportive blood 
0	or on my frailties why are frailer spies 
0	which in their wills count bad what i think good 
0	no i am that i am and they that level
0	at my abuses reckon up their own 
0	i may be straight though they themselves be bevel 
0	by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown 
0	unless this general evil they maintain 
0	all men are bad and in their badness reign 
0	thy gift thy tables are within my brain
0	full character d with lasting memory 
0	which shall above that idle rank remain 
0	beyond all date even to eternity 
0	or at the least so long as brain and heart
0	have faculty by nature to subsist 
0	till each to raz d oblivion yield his part
0	of thee thy record never can be miss d 
0	that poor retention could not so much hold 
0	nor need i tallies thy dear love to score 
0	therefore to give them from me was i bold 
0	to trust those tables that receive thee more 
0	to keep an adjunct to remember thee
0	were to import forgetfulness in me 
0	no time thou shalt not boast that i do change 
0	thy pyramids built up with newer might
0	to me are nothing novel nothing strange 
0	they are but dressings of a former sight 
0	our dates are brief and therefore we admire
0	what thou dost foist upon us that is old 
0	and rather make them born to our desire
0	than think that we before have heard them told 
0	thy registers and thee i both defy 
0	not wondering at the present nor the past 
0	for thy records and what we see doth lie 
0	made more or less by thy continual haste 
0	this i do vow and this shall ever be 
0	i will be true despite thy scythe and thee 
0	if my dear love were but the child of state 
0	as subject to time s love or to time s hate 
0	weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gather d 
0	no it was builded far from accident 
0	it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
0	under the blow of thralled discontent 
0	whereto th inviting time our fashion calls 
0	it fears not policy that heretic 
0	which works on leases of short number d hours 
0	but all alone stands hugely politic 
0	that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers 
0	to this i witness call the fools of time 
0	which die for goodness who have lived for crime 
0	were t aught to me i bore the canopy 
0	with my extern the outward honouring 
0	or laid great bases for eternity 
0	which proves more short than waste or ruining 
0	have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
0	lose all and more by paying too much rent
0	for compound sweet forgoing simple savour 
0	pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent 
0	no let me be obsequious in thy heart 
0	and take thou my oblation poor but free 
0	which is not mix d with seconds knows no art 
0	but mutual render only me for thee 
0	hence thou suborned informer a true soul
0	when most impeach d stands least in thy control 
0	o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
0	dost hold time s fickle glass his fickle hour 
0	who hast by waning grown and therein show st
0	thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow st 
0	if nature sovereign mistress over wrack 
0	as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back 
0	she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
0	may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill 
0	yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure 
0	she may detain but not still keep her treasure 
0	her audit though delayed answered must be 
0	and her quietus is to render thee 
0	in the old age black was not counted fair 
0	or if it were it bore not beauty s name 
0	but now is black beauty s successive heir 
0	for since each hand hath put on nature s power 
0	fairing the foul with art s false borrowed face 
0	sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower 
0	but is profan d if not lives in disgrace 
0	therefore my mistress eyes are raven black 
0	her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
0	at such who not born fair no beauty lack 
0	sland ring creation with a false esteem 
0	yet so they mourn becoming of their woe 
0	that every tongue says beauty should look so 
0	how oft when thou my music music play st 
0	upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
0	with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway st
0	the wiry concord that mine ear confounds 
0	do i envy those jacks that nimble leap 
0	to kiss the tender inward of thy hand 
0	whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap 
0	at the wood s boldness by thee blushing stand 
0	to be so tickled they would change their state
0	and situation with those dancing chips 
0	o er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait 
0	making dead wood more bless d than living lips 
0	since saucy jacks so happy are in this 
0	give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss 
0	the expense of spirit in a waste of shame
0	is lust in action and till action lust
0	is perjur d murderous bloody full of blame 
0	savage extreme rude cruel not to trust 
0	enjoy d no sooner but despised straight 
0	past reason hunted and no sooner had 
0	past reason hated as a swallow d bait 
0	on purpose laid to make the taker mad 
0	mad in pursuit and in possession so 
0	had having and in quest to have extreme 
0	a bliss in proof and prov d a very woe 
0	before a joy propos d behind a dream 
0	all this the world well knows yet none knows well
0	to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell 
0	my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun 
0	coral is far more red than her lips red 
0	if snow be white why then her breasts are dun 
0	if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head 
0	i have seen roses damask d red and white 
0	but no such roses see i in her cheeks 
0	and in some perfumes is there more delight
0	than in the breath that from my mistress reeks 
0	i love to hear her speak yet well i know
0	that music hath a far more pleasing sound 
0	i grant i never saw a goddess go 
0	my mistress when she walks treads on the ground 
0	and yet by heaven i think my love as rare 
0	as any she belied with false compare 
0	thou art as tyrannous so as thou art 
0	as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel 
0	for well thou know st to my dear doting heart
0	yet in good faith some say that thee behold 
0	thy face hath not the power to make love groan 
0	to say they err i dare not be so bold 
0	although i swear it to myself alone 
0	and to be sure that is not false i swear 
0	a thousand groans but thinking on thy face 
0	one on another s neck do witness bear
0	thy black is fairest in my judgment s place 
0	in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds 
0	and thence this slander as i think proceeds 
0	thine eyes i love and they as pitying me 
0	knowing thy heart torment me with disdain 
0	have put on black and loving mourners be 
0	looking with pretty ruth upon my pain 
0	and truly not the morning sun of heaven
0	better becomes the grey cheeks of the east 
0	nor that full star that ushers in the even 
0	doth half that glory to the sober west 
0	as those two mourning eyes become thy face 
0	o let it then as well beseem thy heart
0	to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace 
0	and suit thy pity like in every part 
0	then will i swear beauty herself is black 
0	and all they foul that thy complexion lack 
0	beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
0	for that deep wound it gives my friend and me 
0	is t not enough to torture me alone 
0	but slave to slavery my sweet st friend must be 
0	me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken 
0	and my next self thou harder hast engross d 
0	of him myself and thee i am forsaken 
0	a torment thrice three fold thus to be cross d 
0	prison my heart in thy steel bosom s ward 
0	but then my friend s heart let my poor heart bail 
0	whoe er keeps me let my heart be his guard 
0	thou canst not then use rigour in my jail 
0	and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee 
0	perforce am thine and all that is in me 
0	so now i have confess d that he is thine 
0	and i my self am mortgag d to thy will 
0	myself i ll forfeit so that other mine
0	thou wilt restore to be my comfort still 
0	but thou wilt not nor he will not be free 
0	for thou art covetous and he is kind 
0	he learn d but surety like to write for me 
0	under that bond that him as fast doth bind 
0	the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take 
0	thou usurer that putt st forth all to use 
0	and sue a friend came debtor for my sake 
0	so him i lose through my unkind abuse 
0	him have i lost thou hast both him and me 
0	he pays the whole and yet am i not free 
0	whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will 
0	and will to boot and will in over plus 
0	more than enough am i that vex d thee still 
0	to thy sweet will making addition thus 
0	wilt thou whose will is large and spacious 
0	not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine 
0	shall will in others seem right gracious 
0	and in my will no fair acceptance shine 
0	the sea all water yet receives rain still 
0	and in abundance addeth to his store 
0	so thou being rich in will add to thy will 
0	one will of mine to make thy large will more 
0	let no unkind no fair beseechers kill 
0	think all but one and me in that one will 
0	if thy soul check thee that i come so near 
0	swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will 
0	and will thy soul knows is admitted there 
0	thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfil 
0	 will will fulfil the treasure of thy love 
0	ay fill it full with wills and my will one 
0	in things of great receipt with ease we prove
0	among a number one is reckon d none 
0	then in the number let me pass untold 
0	though in thy store s account i one must be 
0	for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
0	that nothing me a something sweet to thee 
0	make but my name thy love and love that still 
0	and then thou lov st me for my name is will 
0	thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes 
0	that they behold and see not what they see 
0	they know what beauty is see where it lies 
0	yet what the best is take the worst to be 
0	if eyes corrupt by over partial looks 
0	be anchor d in the bay where all men ride 
0	why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks 
0	whereto the judgment of my heart is tied 
0	why should my heart think that a several plot 
0	which my heart knows the wide world s common place 
0	or mine eyes seeing this say this is not 
0	to put fair truth upon so foul a face 
0	in things right true my heart and eyes have err d 
0	and to this false plague are they now transferr d 
0	when my love swears that she is made of truth 
0	i do believe her though i know she lies 
0	that she might think me some untutor d youth 
0	unlearned in the world s false subtleties 
0	thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young 
0	although she knows my days are past the best 
0	simply i credit her false speaking tongue 
0	on both sides thus is simple truth suppressed 
0	but wherefore says she not she is unjust 
0	and wherefore say not i that i am old 
0	o love s best habit is in seeming trust 
0	and age in love loves not to have years told 
0	therefore i lie with her and she with me 
0	and in our faults by lies we flatter d be 
0	o call not me to justify the wrong
0	that thy unkindness lays upon my heart 
0	wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue 
0	use power with power and slay me not by art 
0	tell me thou lov st elsewhere but in my sight 
0	dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside 
0	what need st thou wound with cunning when thy might
0	is more than my o erpress d defence can bide 
0	let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
0	her pretty looks have been mine enemies 
0	and therefore from my face she turns my foes 
0	that they elsewhere might dart their injuries 
0	yet do not so but since i am near slain 
0	kill me outright with looks and rid my pain 
0	be wise as thou art cruel do not press
0	my tongue tied patience with too much disdain 
0	lest sorrow lend me words and words express
0	the manner of my pity wanting pain 
0	if i might teach thee wit better it were 
0	though not to love yet love to tell me so 
0	as testy sick men when their deaths be near 
0	no news but health from their physicians know 
0	for if i should despair i should grow mad 
0	and in my madness might speak ill of thee 
0	now this ill wresting world is grown so bad 
0	mad slanderers by mad ears believed be 
0	that i may not be so nor thou belied 
0	bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide 
0	in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes 
0	for they in thee a thousand errors note 
0	but tis my heart that loves what they despise 
0	who in despite of view is pleased to dote 
0	nor are mine ears with thy tongue s tune delighted 
0	nor tender feeling to base touches prone 
0	nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
0	to any sensual feast with thee alone 
0	but my five wits nor my five senses can
0	dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee 
0	who leaves unsway d the likeness of a man 
0	thy proud heart s slave and vassal wretch to be 
0	only my plague thus far i count my gain 
0	that she that makes me sin awards me pain 
0	love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate 
0	hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving 
0	o but with mine compare thou thine own state 
0	and thou shalt find it merits not reproving 
0	or if it do not from those lips of thine 
0	that have profan d their scarlet ornaments
0	and seal d false bonds of love as oft as mine 
0	robb d others beds revenues of their rents 
0	be it lawful i love thee as thou lov st those
0	whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee 
0	root pity in thy heart that when it grows 
0	thy pity may deserve to pitied be 
0	if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide 
0	by self example mayst thou be denied 
0	lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
0	one of her feather d creatures broke away 
0	sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
0	in pursuit of the thing she would have stay 
0	whilst her neglected child holds her in chase 
0	cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
0	to follow that which flies before her face 
0	not prizing her poor infant s discontent 
0	so runn st thou after that which flies from thee 
0	whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind 
0	but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me 
0	and play the mother s part kiss me be kind 
0	so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will 
0	if thou turn back and my loud crying still 
0	two loves i have of comfort and despair 
0	which like two spirits do suggest me still 
0	the better angel is a man right fair 
0	the worser spirit a woman colour d ill 
0	to win me soon to hell my female evil 
0	tempteth my better angel from my side 
0	and would corrupt my saint to be a devil 
0	wooing his purity with her foul pride 
0	and whether that my angel be turn d fiend 
0	suspect i may yet not directly tell 
0	but being both from me both to each friend 
0	i guess one angel in another s hell 
0	yet this shall i ne er know but live in doubt 
0	till my bad angel fire my good one out 
0	those lips that love s own hand did make 
0	breathed forth the sound that said i hate 
0	to me that languish d for her sake 
0	but when she saw my woeful state 
0	straight in her heart did mercy come 
0	chiding that tongue that ever sweet
0	was us d in giving gentle doom 
0	and taught it thus anew to greet 
0	 i hate she alter d with an end 
0	that followed it as gentle day 
0	doth follow night who like a fiend
0	from heaven to hell is flown away 
0	 i hate from hate away she threw 
0	and sav d my life saying not you 
0	poor soul the centre of my sinful earth 
0	my sinful earth these rebel powers array 
0	why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth 
0	painting thy outward walls so costly gay 
0	why so large cost having so short a lease 
0	dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend 
0	shall worms inheritors of this excess 
0	eat up thy charge is this thy body s end 
0	then soul live thou upon thy servant s loss 
0	and let that pine to aggravate thy store 
0	buy terms divine in selling hours of dross 
0	within be fed without be rich no more 
0	so shall thou feed on death that feeds on men 
0	and death once dead there s no more dying then 
0	my love is as a fever longing still 
0	for that which longer nurseth the disease 
0	feeding on that which doth preserve the ill 
0	the uncertain sickly appetite to please 
0	my reason the physician to my love 
0	angry that his prescriptions are not kept 
0	hath left me and i desperate now approve
0	desire is death which physic did except 
0	past cure i am now reason is past care 
0	and frantic mad with evermore unrest 
0	my thoughts and my discourse as madmen s are 
0	at random from the truth vainly express d 
0	for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright 
0	who art as black as hell as dark as night 
0	o me what eyes hath love put in my head 
0	which have no correspondence with true sight 
0	or if they have where is my judgment fled 
0	that censures falsely what they see aright 
0	if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote 
0	what means the world to say it is not so 
0	if it be not then love doth well denote
0	love s eye is not so true as all men s no 
0	how can it o how can love s eye be true 
0	that is so vexed with watching and with tears 
0	no marvel then though i mistake my view 
0	the sun itself sees not till heaven clears 
0	o cunning love with tears thou keep st me blind 
0	lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find 
0	canst thou o cruel say i love thee not 
0	when i against myself with thee partake 
0	do i not think on thee when i forgot
0	am of my self all tyrant for thy sake 
0	who hateth thee that i do call my friend 
0	on whom frown st thou that i do fawn upon 
0	nay if thou lour st on me do i not spend
0	revenge upon myself with present moan 
0	what merit do i in my self respect 
0	that is so proud thy service to despise 
0	when all my best doth worship thy defect 
0	commanded by the motion of thine eyes 
0	but love hate on for now i know thy mind 
0	those that can see thou lov st and i am blind 
0	o from what power hast thou this powerful might 
0	with insufficiency my heart to sway 
0	to make me give the lie to my true sight 
0	and swear that brightness doth not grace the day 
0	whence hast thou this becoming of things ill 
0	that in the very refuse of thy deeds
0	there is such strength and warrantise of skill 
0	that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds 
0	who taught thee how to make me love thee more 
0	the more i hear and see just cause of hate 
0	o though i love what others do abhor 
0	with others thou shouldst not abhor my state 
0	if thy unworthiness rais d love in me 
0	more worthy i to be belov d of thee 
0	love is too young to know what conscience is 
0	yet who knows not conscience is born of love 
0	then gentle cheater urge not my amiss 
0	lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove 
0	for thou betraying me i do betray
0	my nobler part to my gross body s treason 
0	my soul doth tell my body that he may
0	triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason 
0	but rising at thy name doth point out thee 
0	as his triumphant prize proud of this pride 
0	he is contented thy poor drudge to be 
0	to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side 
0	no want of conscience hold it that i call
0	her love for whose dear love i rise and fall 
0	in loving thee thou know st i am forsworn 
0	but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing 
0	in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn 
0	in vowing new hate after new love bearing 
0	but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee 
0	when i break twenty i am perjur d most 
0	for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee 
0	and all my honest faith in thee is lost 
0	for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness 
0	oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy 
0	and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness 
0	or made them swear against the thing they see 
0	for i have sworn thee fair more perjur d i 
0	to swear against the truth so foul a lie 
0	cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep 
0	a maid of dian s this advantage found 
0	and his love kindling fire did quickly steep
0	in a cold valley fountain of that ground 
0	which borrow d from this holy fire of love 
0	a dateless lively heat still to endure 
0	and grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
0	against strange maladies a sovereign cure 
0	but at my mistress eye love s brand new fired 
0	the boy for trial needs would touch my breast 
0	i sick withal the help of bath desired 
0	and thither hied a sad distemper d guest 
0	but found no cure the bath for my help lies
0	where cupid got new fire my mistress eyes 
0	the little love god lying once asleep 
0	laid by his side his heart inflaming brand 
0	whilst many nymphs that vow d chaste life to keep
0	came tripping by but in her maiden hand
0	the fairest votary took up that fire
0	which many legions of true hearts had warm d 
0	and so the general of hot desire
0	was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm d 
0	this brand she quenched in a cool well by 
0	which from love s fire took heat perpetual 
0	growing a bath and healthful remedy 
0	for men diseas d but i my mistress thrall 
0	came there for cure and this by that i prove 
0	love s fire heats water water cools not love 
0	and daff d me to a cabin hang d with care 
0	when my love swears that she is made of truth 
0	i do believe her though i know she lies 
0	that she might think me some untutor d youth 
0	unskilful in the world s false forgeries 
0	thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young 
0	although i know my years be past the best 
0	i smiling credit her false speaking tongue 
0	outfacing faults in love with love s ill rest 
0	but wherefore says my love that she is young 
0	and wherefore say not i that i am old 
0	o love s best habit is a soothing tongue 
0	and age in love loves not to have years told 
0	therefore i ll lie with love and love with me 
0	since that our faults in love thus smother d be 
0	two loves i have of comfort and despair 
0	that like two spirits do suggest me still 
0	my better angel is a man right fair 
0	my worser spirit a woman colour d ill 
0	to win me soon to hell my female evil
0	tempteth my better angel from my side 
0	and would corrupt my saint to be a devil 
0	wooing his purity with her fair pride 
0	and whether that my angel be turn d fiend 
0	suspect i may yet not directly tell 
0	for being both to me both to each friend 
0	i guess one angel in another s hell 
0	the truth i shall not know but live in doubt 
0	till my bad angel fire my good one out 
0	did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye 
0	 gainst whom the world could not hold argument 
0	persuade my heart to this false perjury 
0	vows for thee broke deserve not punishment 
0	a woman i forswore but i will prove 
0	thou being a goddess i forswore not thee 
0	my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love 
0	thy grace being gain d cures all disgrace in me 
0	my vow was breath and breath a vapour is 
0	then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine 
0	exhale this vapour vow in thee it is 
0	if broken then it is no fault of mine 
0	if by me broke what fool is not so wise
0	to break an oath to win a paradise 
0	sweet cytherea sitting by a brook
0	with young adonis lovely fresh and green 
0	did court the lad with many a lovely look 
0	such looks as none could look but beauty s queen 
0	she told him stories to delight his ear 
0	she show d him favours to allure his eye 
0	to win his heart she touch d him here and there 
0	touches so soft still conquer chastity 
0	but whether unripe years did want conceit 
0	or he refused to take her figured proffer 
0	the tender nibbler would not touch the bait 
0	but smile and jest at every gentle offer 
0	then fell she on her back fair queen and toward 
0	he rose and ran away ah fool too froward 
0	if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love 
0	o never faith could hold if not to beauty vow d 
0	though to myself forsworn to thee i ll constant prove 
0	those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bow d 
0	study his bias leaves and make his book thine eyes 
0	where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend 
0	if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice 
0	well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend 
0	all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder 
0	which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire 
0	thy eye jove s lightning seems thy voice his dreadful thunder 
0	which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire 
0	celestial as thou art o do not love that wrong 
0	to sing heaven s praise with such an earthly tongue 
0	scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn 
0	and scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade 
0	when cytherea all in love forlorn 
0	a longing tarriance for adonis made
0	under an osier growing by a brook 
0	a brook where adon used to cool his spleen 
0	hot was the day she hotter that did look
0	for his approach that often there had been 
0	anon he comes and throws his mantle by 
0	and stood stark naked on the brook s green brim 
0	the sun look d on the world with glorious eye 
0	yet not so wistly as this queen on him 
0	he spying her bounced in whereas he stood 
0	 o jove quoth she why was not i a flood 
0	fair is my love but not so fair as fickle 
0	mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty 
0	brighter than glass and yet as glass is brittle 
0	softer than wax and yet as iron rusty 
0	a lily pale with damask dye to grace her 
0	none fairer nor none falser to deface her 
0	her lips to mine how often hath she joined 
0	between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing 
0	how many tales to please me bath she coined 
0	dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing 
0	yet in the midst of all her pure protestings 
0	her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings 
0	she burn d with love as straw with fire flameth 
0	she burn d out love as soon as straw outburneth 
0	she framed the love and yet she foil d the framing 
0	she bade love last and yet she fell a turning 
0	was this a lover or a lecher whether 
0	bad in the best though excellent in neither 
0	if music and sweet poetry agree 
0	as they must needs the sister and the brother 
0	then must the love be great twixt thee and me 
0	because thou lovest the one and i the other 
0	dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch
0	upon the lute doth ravish human sense 
0	spenser to me whose deep conceit is such
0	as passing all conceit needs no defence 
0	thou lovest to bear the sweet melodious sound
0	that phoebus lute the queen of music makes 
0	and i in deep delight am chiefly drown d
0	whenas himself to singing he betakes 
0	one god is god of both as poets feign 
0	one knight loves both and both in thee remain 
0	fair was the morn when the fair queen of love 
0	paler for sorrow than her milk white dove 
0	for adon s sake a youngster proud and wild 
0	her stand she takes upon a steep up hill 
0	anon adonis comes with horn and hounds 
0	she silly queen with more than love s good will 
0	forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds 
0	 once quoth she did i see a fair sweet youth
0	here in these brakes deep wounded with a boar 
0	deep in the thigh a spectacle of ruth 
0	see in my thigh quoth she here was the sore 
0	she showed hers he saw more wounds than one 
0	and blushing fled and left her all alone 
0	sweet rose fair flower untimely pluck d soon vaded 
0	pluck d in the bud and vaded in the spring 
0	bright orient pearl alack too timely shaded 
0	fair creature kill d too soon by death s sharp sting 
0	like a green plum that hangs upon a tree 
0	and falls through wind before the fall should he 
0	i weep for thee and yet no cause i have 
0	for why thou left st me nothing in thy will 
0	and yet thou left st me more than i did crave 
0	for why i craved nothing of thee still 
0	o yes dear friend i pardon crave of thee 
0	thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me 
0	venus with young adonis sitting by her
0	under a myrtle shade began to woo him 
0	she told the youngling how god mars did try her 
0	and as he fell to her so fell she to him 
0	 even thus quoth she the warlike god embraced me 
0	and then she clipp d adonis in her arms 
0	 even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me 
0	as if the boy should use like loving charms 
0	 even thus quoth she he seized on my lips
0	and with her lips on his did act the seizure
0	and as she fetched breath away he skips 
0	and would not take her meaning nor her pleasure 
0	ah that i had my lady at this bay 
0	to kiss and clip me till i run away 
0	crabbed age and youth cannot live together
0	youth is full of pleasance age is full of care 
0	youth like summer morn age like winter weather 
0	youth like summer brave age like winter bare 
0	youth is full of sport age s breath is short 
0	youth is nimble age is lame 
0	youth is hot and bold age is weak and cold 
0	youth is wild and age is tame 
0	age i do abhor thee youth i do adore thee 
0	o my love my love is young 
0	age i do defy thee o sweet shepherd hie thee 
0	for methinks thou stay st too long 
0	beauty is but a vain and doubtful good 
0	a shining gloss that vadeth suddenly 
0	a flower that dies when first it gins to bud 
0	a brittle glass that s broken presently 
0	a doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower 
0	lost vaded broken dead within an hour 
0	and as goods lost are seld or never found 
0	as vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh 
0	as flowers dead lie wither d on the ground 
0	as broken glass no cement can redress 
0	so beauty blemish d once s for ever lost 
0	in spite of physic painting pain and cost 
0	good night good rest ah neither be my share 
0	she bade good night that kept my rest away 
0	to descant on the doubts of my decay 
0	 farewell quoth she and come again tomorrow 
0	fare well i could not for i supp d with sorrow 
0	yet at my parting sweetly did she smile 
0	in scorn or friendship nill i construe whether 
0	 t may be she joy d to jest at my exile 
0	 t may be again to make me wander thither 
0	 wander a word for shadows like myself 
0	as take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf 
0	lord how mine eyes throw gazes to the east 
0	my heart doth charge the watch the morning rise
0	doth cite each moving sense from idle rest 
0	not daring trust the office of mine eyes 
0	while philomela sits and sings i sit and mark 
0	and wish her lays were tuned like the lark 
0	for she doth welcome daylight with her ditty 
0	and drives away dark dismal dreaming night 
0	the night so pack d i post unto my pretty 
0	heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight 
0	sorrow changed to solace solace mix d with sorrow 
0	for why she sigh d and bade me come tomorrow 
0	were i with her the night would post too soon 
0	but now are minutes added to the hours 
0	to spite me now each minute seems a moon 
0	yet not for me shine sun to succour flowers 
0	pack night peep day good day of night now borrow 
0	short night to night and length thyself
0	to morrow
