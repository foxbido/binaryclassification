0	now had the great proclaimer with a voice
0	more awful than the sound of trumpet cried
0	repentance and heaven s kingdom nigh at hand
0	to all baptized to his great baptism flocked
0	with awe the regions round and with them came
0	from nazareth the son of joseph deemed
0	to the flood jordan came as then obscure 
0	unmarked unknown but him the baptist soon
0	descried divinely warned and witness bore
0	as to his worthier and would have resigned
0	to him his heavenly office nor was long
0	his witness unconfirmed on him baptized
0	heaven opened and in likeness of a dove
0	the spirit descended while the father s voice
0	from heaven pronounced him his beloved son 
0	that heard the adversary who roving still
0	about the world at that assembly famed
0	would not be last and with the voice divine
0	nigh thunder struck the exalted man to whom

0	upon my head long the decrees of heaven
0	delay for longest time to him is short 
0	and now too soon for us the circling hours
0	this dreaded time have compassed wherein we

0	broken be not intended all our power
0	to be infringed our freedom and our being
0	in this fair empire won of earth and air 
0	for this ill news i bring the woman s seed 
0	destined to this is late of woman born 
0	his birth to our just fear gave no small cause 
0	but his growth now to youth s full flower displaying
0	all virtue grace and wisdom to achieve
0	things highest greatest multiplies my fear 
0	before him a great prophet to proclaim
0	his coming is sent harbinger who all
0	invites and in the consecrated stream
0	pretends to wash off sin and fit them so
0	purified to receive him pure or rather
0	to do him honour as their king all come 
0	and he himself among them was baptized 
0	not thence to be more pure but to receive
0	the testimony of heaven that who he is
0	thenceforth the nations may not doubt i saw
0	the prophet do him reverence on him rising
0	out of the water heaven above the clouds
0	unfold her crystal doors thence on his head
0	a perfet dove descend whate er it meant 
0	and out of heaven the sovraign voice i heard 
0	 this is my son beloved in him am pleased 
0	his mother than is mortal but his sire
0	he who obtains the monarchy of heaven 
0	and what will he not do to advance his son 
0	his first begot we know and sore have felt 
0	when his fierce thunder drove us to the deep 
0	who this is we must learn for man he seems
0	in all his lineaments though in his face
0	the glimpses of his father s glory shine 
0	ye see our danger on the utmost edge
0	of hazard which admits no long debate 
0	but must with something sudden be opposed
0	 not force but well couched fraud well woven snares 
0	ere in the head of nations he appear 
0	their king their leader and supreme on earth 
0	i when no other durst sole undertook
0	the dismal expedition to find out
0	and ruin adam and the exploit performed
0	successfully a calmer voyage now
0	will waft me and the way found prosperous once
0	induces best to hope of like success 
0	he ended and his words impression left
0	of much amazement to the infernal crew 
0	distracted and surprised with deep dismay
0	at these sad tidings but no time was then
0	for long indulgence to their fears or grief 
0	unanimous they all commit the care
0	and management of this man enterprise
0	to him their great dictator whose attempt
0	at first against mankind so well had thrived
0	in adam s overthrow and led their march
0	from hell s deep vaulted den to dwell in light 
0	regents and potentates and kings yea gods 
0	of many a pleasant realm and province wide 
0	so to the coast of jordan he directs
0	his easy steps girded with snaky wiles 
0	where he might likeliest find this new declared 
0	this man of men attested son of god 
0	temptation and all guile on him to try 
0	so to subvert whom he suspected raised
0	to end his reign on earth so long enjoyed 
0	but contrary unweeting he fulfilled
0	the purposed counsel pre ordained and fixed 
0	of the most high who in full frequence bright
0	of angels thus to gabriel smiling spake 
0	 gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold 
0	thou and all angels conversant on earth
0	with man or men s affairs how i begin
0	to verify that solemn message late 
0	on which i sent thee to the virgin pure
0	in galilee that she should bear a son 
0	great in renown and called the son of god 
0	then told st her doubting how these things could be
0	to her a virgin that on her should come
0	the holy ghost and the power of the highest
0	o ershadow her this man born and now upgrown 
0	to shew him worthy of his birth divine
0	and high prediction henceforth i expose
0	to satan let him tempt and now assay
0	his utmost subtlety because he boasts
0	and vaunts of his great cunning to the throng
0	of his apostasy he might have learnt
0	less overweening since he failed in job 
0	whose constant perseverance overcame
0	whate er his cruel malice could invent 
0	he now shall know i can produce a man 
0	of female seed far abler to resist
0	all his solicitations and at length
0	all his vast force and drive him back to hell 
0	winning by conquest what the first man lost
0	by fallacy surprised but first i mean
0	to exercise him in the wilderness 
0	there he shall first lay down the rudiments
0	of his great warfare ere i send him forth
0	to conquer sin and death the two grand foes 
0	by humiliation and strong sufferance
0	his weakness shall o ercome satanic strength 
0	and all the world and mass of sinful flesh 
0	that all the angels and aethereal powers 
0	they now and men hereafter may discern
0	from what consummate virtue i have chose
0	this perfet man by merit called my son 
0	to earn salvation for the sons of men 
0	so spake the eternal father and all heaven
0	admiring stood a space then into hymns
0	burst forth and in celestial measures moved 
0	circling the throne and singing while the hand
0	sung with the voice and this the argument 
0	 victory and triumph to the son of god 
0	now entering his great duel not of arms 
0	but to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles 
0	the father knows the son therefore secure
0	ventures his filial virtue though untried 
0	against whate er may tempt whate er seduce 
0	allure or terrify or undermine 
0	be frustrate all ye stratagems of hell 
0	and devilish machinations come to nought 
0	so they in heaven their odes and vigils tuned 
0	meanwhile the son of god who yet some days
0	lodged in bethabara where john baptized 
0	musing and much revolving in his breast
0	how best the mighty work he might begin
0	of saviour to mankind and which way first
0	publish his godlike office now mature 
0	one day forth walked alone the spirit leading
0	and his deep thoughts the better to converse
0	with solitude till far from track of men 
0	thought following thought and step by step led on 
0	he entered now the bordering desert wild 
0	and with dark shades and rocks environed round 
0	his holy meditations thus pursued 
0	 o what a multitude of thoughts at once
0	awakened in me swarm while i consider
0	what from within i feel myself and hear
0	what from without comes often to my ears 
0	ill sorting with my present state compared 
0	when i was yet a child no childish play
0	to me was pleasing all my mind was set
0	serious to learn and know and thence to do 
0	what might be public good myself i thought
0	born to that end born to promote all truth 
0	all righteous things therefore above my years 
0	the law of god i read and found it sweet 
0	made it my whole delight and in it grew
0	to such perfection that ere yet my age
0	had measured twice six years at our great feast
0	i went into the temple there to hear
0	the teachers of our law and to propose
0	what might improve my knowledge or their own 
0	and was admired by all yet this not all
0	to which my spirit aspired victorious deeds
0	flamed in my heart heroic acts one while
0	to rescue israel from the roman yoke 
0	then to subdue and quell o er all the earth 
0	brute violence and proud tyrannic power 
0	till truth were freed and equity restored 
0	yet held it more humane more heavenly first
0	by winning words to conquer willing hearts 
0	and make persuasion do the work of fear 
0	at least to try and teach the erring soul 
0	not wilfully misdoing but unware
0	misled the stubborn only to subdue 
0	these growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving 
0	by words at times cast forth inly rejoiced 
0	and said to me apart high are thy thoughts 
0	o son but nourish them and let them soar
0	to what highth sacred virtue and true worth
0	can raise them though above example high 
0	by matchless deeds express thy matchless sire 
0	for know thou art no son of mortal man 
0	though men esteem thee low of parentage 
0	thy father is the eternal king who rules
0	all heaven and earth angels and sons of men 
0	a messenger from god foretold thy birth
0	conceived in me a virgin he foretold
0	thou shouldst be great and sit on david s throne 
0	and of thy kingdom there should be no end 
0	at thy nativity a glorious quire
0	of angels in the fields of bethlehem sung
0	to shepherds watching at their folds by night 
0	and told them the messiah now was born 
0	where they might see him and to thee they came 
0	directed to the manger where thou lay st 
0	for in the inn was left no better room 
0	a star not seen before in heaven appearing 
0	guided the wise men thither from the east 
0	to honour thee with incense myrrh and gold 
0	by whose bright course led on they found the place 
0	affirming it thy star new graven in heaven 
0	by which they knew thee king of israel born 
0	just simeon and prophetic anna warned
0	by vision found thee in the temple and spake 
0	before the altar and the vested priest 
0	like things of thee to all that present stood 
0	this having heart straight i again revolved
0	the law and prophets searching what was writ
0	concerning the messiah to our scribes
0	known partly and soon found of whom they spake
0	i am this chiefly that my way must lie
0	through many a hard assay even to the death 
0	ere i the promised kingdom can attain 
0	or work redemption for mankind whose sins 
0	full weight must be transferred upon my head 
0	yet neither thus disheartened or dismayed 
0	the time prefixed i waited when behold
0	the baptist of whose birth i oft had heard 
0	not knew by sight now come who was to come
0	before messiah and his way prepare 
0	i as all others to his baptism came 
0	which i believed was from above but he
0	straight knew me and with loudest voice proclaimed
0	me him for it was shewn him so from heaven 
0	me him whose harbinger he was and first
0	refused on me his baptism to confer 
0	as much his greater and was hardly won 
0	but as i rose out of the laving stream 
0	heaven opened her eternal doors from whence
0	the spirit descended on me like a dove 
0	and last the sum of all my father s voice 
0	audibly heard from heaven pronounced me his 
0	me his beloved son in whom alone
0	he was well pleased by which i knew the time
0	now full that i no more should live obscure 
0	but openly begin as best becomes
0	the authority which i derived from heaven 
0	and now by some strong motion i am led
0	into this wilderness to what intent
0	i learn not yet perhaps i need not know 
0	for what concerns my knowledge god reveals 
0	so spake our morning star then in his rise 
0	and looking round on every side beheld
0	a pathless desert dusk with horrid shades 
0	the way he came not having marked return 
0	was difficult by human steps untrod 
0	and he still on was led but with such thoughts
0	accompanied of things past and to come
0	lodged in his breast as well might recommend
0	such solitude before choicest society 
0	full forty days he passed whether on hill
0	sometimes anon in shady vale each night
0	under the covert of some ancient oak
0	or cedar to defend him from the dew 
0	or harboured in one cave is not revealed 
0	nor tasted human food nor hunger felt 
0	till those days ended hungered then at last
0	among wild beasts they at his sight grew mild 
0	nor sleeping him nor waking harmed his walk
0	the fiery serpent fled and noxious worm 
0	the lion and fierce tiger glared aloof 
0	but now an aged man in rural weeds 
0	following as seemed the quest of some stray eye 
0	or withered sticks to gather which might serve
0	against a winter s day when winds blow keen 
0	to warm him wet returned from field at eve 
0	he saw approach who first with curious eye
0	perused him then with words thus uttered spake 
0	 sir what ill chance hath brought thee to this place 
0	so far from path or road of men who pass
0	in troop or caravan for single none
0	durst ever who returned and dropt not here
0	his carcass pined with hunger and with droughth 
0	i ask the rather and the more admire 
0	for that to me thou seem st the man whom late
0	our new baptizing prophet at the ford
0	of jordan honoured so and called thee son
0	of god i saw and heard for we sometimes
0	who dwell this wild constrained by want come forth
0	to town or village nigh nighest is far 
0	where aught we hear and curious are to hear 
0	what happens new fame also finds us out 
0	to whom the son of god who brought me hither
0	will bring me hence no other guide i seek 
0	 by miracle he may replied the swain 
0	 what other way i see not for we here
0	live on tough roots and stubs to thirst inured
0	more than the camel and to drink go far 
0	men to much misery and hardship born 
0	but if thou be the son of god command
0	that out of these hard stones be made thee bread 
0	so shalt thou save thyself and us relieve
0	with food whereof we wretched seldom taste 
0	he ended and the son of god replied 
0	 think st thou such force in bread is it not written
0	 for i discern thee other than thou seem st 
0	man lives not by bread only but each word
0	proceeding from the mouth of god who fed
0	our fathers here with manna in the mount
0	moses was forty days nor eat nor drank 
0	and forty days eliah without food
0	wandered this barren waste the same i now 
0	why dost thou then suggest to me distrust
0	knowing who i am as i know who thou art 
0	whom thus answered the arch fiend now undisguised 
0	 tis true i am that spirit unfortunate
0	who leagued with millions more in rash revolt 
0	kept not my happy station but was driven
0	with them from bliss to the bottomless deep 
0	yet to that hideous place not so confined
0	by rigour unconniving but that oft 
0	leaving my dolorous prison i enjoy
0	large liberty to round this globe of earth 
0	or range in the air nor from the heaven of heavens
0	hath he excluded my resort sometimes 
0	i came among the sons of god when he
0	gave up into my hands uzzean job 
0	to prove him and illustrate his high worth 
0	and when to all his angels he proposed
0	to draw the proud king ahab into fraud 
0	that he might fall in ramoth they demurring 
0	i undertook that office and the tongues
0	of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies
0	to his destruction as i had in charge 
0	for what he bids i do though i have lost
0	much lustre of my native brightness lost
0	to be beloved of god i have not lost
0	to love at least contemplate and admire 
0	what i see excellent in good or fair 
0	or virtuous i should so have lost all sense 
0	what can be then less in me than desire
0	to see thee and approach thee whom i know
0	declared the son of god to hear attent
0	thy wisdom and behold thy godlike deeds 
0	men generally think me much a foe
0	to all mankind why should i they to me
0	never did wrong or violence by them
0	i lost not what i lost rather by them
0	i gained what i have gained and with them dwell
0	copartner in these regions of the world 
0	if not disposer lend them oft my aid 
0	oft my advice by presages and signs 
0	and answers oracles portents and dreams 
0	whereby they may direct their future life 
0	envy they say excites me thus to gain
0	companions of my misery and woe 
0	at first it may be but long since with woe
0	nearer acquainted now i feel by proof
0	that fellowship in pain divides not smart 
0	nor lightens aught each man s peculiar load 
0	small consolation then were man adjoined 
0	this wounds me most what can it less that man 
0	man fallen shall be restored i never more 
0	to whom our saviour sternly thus replied 
0	 deservedly thou griev st composed of lies
0	from the beginning and in lies wilt end 
0	who boast st release from hell and leave to come
0	into the heaven of heavens thou com st indeed 
0	as a poor miserable captive thrall
0	comes to the place where he before had sat
0	among the prime in splendour now deposed 
0	ejected emptied gazed unpitied shunned 
0	a spectacle of ruin or of scorn 
0	to all the host of heaven the happy place
0	imparts to thee no happiness no joy 
0	rather inflames thy torment representing
0	lost bliss to thee no more communicable 
0	so never more in hell than when in heaven 
0	but thou art serviceable to heaven s king 
0	wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear
0	extorts or pleasure to do ill excites 
0	what but thy malice moved thee to misdeem
0	of righteous job then cruelly to afflict him
0	with all inflictions but his patience won 
0	the other service was thy chosen task 
0	to be a liar in four hundred mouths 
0	for lying is thy sustenance thy food 
0	yet thou pretend st to truth all oracles
0	by thee are given and what confessed more true
0	among the nations that hath been thy craft 
0	by mixing somewhat true to vent more lies 
0	but what have been thy answers what but dark 
0	ambiguous and with double sense deluding 
0	which they who asked have seldom understood 
0	and not well understood as good not known 
0	who ever by consulting at thy shrine 
0	returned the wiser or the more instruct
0	to fly or follow what concerned him most 
0	and run not sooner to his fatal snare 
0	for god hath justly given the nations up
0	to thy delusions justly since they fell
0	idolatrous but when his purpose is
0	among them to declare his providence 
0	to thee not known whence hast thou then thy truth 
0	but from him or his angels president
0	in every province who themselves disdaining
0	to approach thy temples give thee in command
0	to thy adorers thou with trembling fear 
0	or like a fawning parasite obey st 
0	then to thyself ascrib st the truth foretold 
0	but this thy glory shall be soon retrenched 
0	no more shalt thou by oracling abuse
0	the gentiles henceforth oracles are ceased 
0	and thou no more with pomp and sacrifice
0	shalt be enquired at delphos or elsewhere 
0	at least in vain for they shall find thee mute 
0	god hath now sent his living oracle
0	into the world to teach his final will 
0	and sends his spirit of truth henceforth to dwell
0	in pious hearts an inward oracle
0	to all truth requisite for men to know 
0	so spake our saviour but the subtle fiend 
0	though inly stung with anger and disdain 
0	dissembled and this answer smooth returned 
0	 sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke 
0	and urged me hard with doings which not will 
0	but misery hath wrested from me where
0	easily canst thou find one miserable 
0	and not inforced oft times to part from truth 
0	if it may stand him more in stead to lie 
0	say and unsay feign flatter or abjure 
0	but thou art placed above me thou art lord 
0	from thee i can and must submiss endure
0	cheek or reproof and glad to scape so quit 
0	hard are the ways of truth and rough to walk 
0	smooth on the tongue discoursed pleasing to the ear 
0	and tunable as sylvan pipe or song 
0	what wonder then if i delight to hear
0	her dictates from thy mouth most men admire
0	virtue who follow not her lore permit me
0	to hear thee when i come since no man comes 
0	and talk at least though i despair to attain 
0	thy father who is holy wise and pure 
0	suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest
0	to tread his sacred courts and minister
0	about his altar handling holy things 
0	praying or vowing and voutsafed his voice
0	to balaam reprobate a prophet yet
0	inspired disdain not such access to me 
0	to whom our saviour with unaltered brow 
0	 thy coming hither though i know thy scope 
0	i bid not or forbid do as thou find st
0	permission from above thou canst not more 
0	he added not and satan bowling low
0	his gray dissimulation disappeared 
0	into thin air diffused for now began
0	night with her sullen wing to double shade
0	the desert fowls in their clay nests were couched 
0	and now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam 
0	meanwhile the new baptized who yet remained
0	at jordan with the baptist and had seen
0	him whom they heard so late expressly called
0	jesus messiah son of god declared 
0	and on that high authority had believed 
0	and with him talked and with him lodged i mean
0	andrew and simon famous after known 
0	with others though in holy writ not named 
0	now missing him their joy so lately found 
0	so lately found and so abruptly gone 
0	began to doubt and doubted many days 
0	and as the days increased increased their doubt 
0	sometimes they thought he might be only shewn 
0	and for a time caught up to god as once
0	moses was in the mount and missing long 
0	and the great thisbite who on fiery wheels
0	rode up to heaven yet once again to come 
0	therefore as those young prophets then with care
0	sought lost eliah so in each place these
0	nigh to bethabara in jericho
0	the city of palms aenon and salem old 
0	machaerus and each town or city walled
0	on this side the broad lake genezaret 
0	or in peraea but returned in vain 
0	then on the bank of jordan by a creek 
0	where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play 
0	plain fishermen no greater men them call 
0	close in a cottage low together got 
0	their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed 
0	 alas from what high hope to what relapse
0	unlooked for are we fallen our eyes beheld
0	messiah certainly now come so long
0	expected of our fathers we have heard
0	his words his wisdom full of grace and truth 
0	 now now for sure deliverance is at hand 
0	the kingdom shall to israel be restored 
0	thus we rejoiced but soon our joy is turned
0	into perplexity and new amaze 
0	for whither is he gone what accident
0	hath rapt him from us will he now retire
0	after appearance and again prolong
0	our expectation god of israel 
0	send thy messiah forth the time is come 
0	behold the kings of the earth how they oppress
0	thy chosen to what highth their power unjust
0	they have exalted and behind them cast
0	all fear of thee arise and vindicate
0	thy glory free thy people from their yoke 
0	but let us wait thus far he hath performed 
0	sent his anointed and to us revealed him
0	by his great prophet pointed at and shown
0	in public and with him we have conversed 
0	let us be glad of this and all our fears
0	lay on his providence he will not fail 
0	nor will withdraw him now nor will recall 
0	mock us with his blest sight then snatch him hence 
0	soon we shall see our hope our joy return 
0	thus they out of their plaints new hope resume
0	to find whom at the first they found unsought 
0	but to his mother mary when she saw
0	others returned from baptism not her son 
0	nor left at jordan tidings of him none 
0	within her breast though calm her breast though pure 
0	motherly cares and fears got head and raised
0	some troubled thoughts which she in sighs thus clad 
0	 oh what avails me now that honour high 
0	to have conceived of god or that salute 
0	 hail highly favoured among women blest 
0	while i to sorrows am no less advanced 
0	and fears as eminent above the lot
0	of other women by the birth i bore 
0	in such a season born when scarce a shed
0	could be obtained to shelter him or me
0	from the bleak air a stable was our warmth 
0	a manger his yet soon enforced to fly
0	were dead who sought his life and missing filled
0	with infant blood the streets of bethlehem 
0	hath been our dwelling many years his life
0	private unactive calm contemplative 
0	little suspicious to any king but now 
0	full grown to man acknowledged as i hear 
0	by john the baptist and in public shewn 
0	son owned from heaven by his father s voice 
0	i looked for some great change to honour no 
0	but trouble as old simeon plain foretold 
0	that to the fall and rising he should be
0	of many in israel and to a sign
0	spoken against that through my very soul
0	a sword shall pierce this is my favoured lot 
0	my exaltation to afflictions high 
0	afflicted i may be it seems and blest 
0	i will not argue that nor will repine 
0	but where delays he now some great intent
0	conceals him when twelve years he scarce had seen 
0	i lost him but so found as well i saw
0	he could not lose himself but went about
0	his father s business what he meant i mused 
0	since understand much more his absence now
0	thus long to some great purpose he obscures 
0	but i to wait with patience am inured 
0	my heart hath been a storehouse long of things
0	and sayings laid up pretending strange events 
0	thus mary pondering oft and oft to mind
0	recalling what remarkably had passed
0	since first her salutation heard with thoughts
0	meekly composed awaited the fulfilling 
0	the while her son tracing the desert wild 
0	sole but with holiest meditations fed 
0	into himself descended and at once
0	all his great work to come before him set 
0	how to begin how to accomplish best
0	his end of being on earth and mission high 
0	for satan with sly preface to return 
0	had left him vacant and with speed was gone
0	up to the middle region of thick air 
0	where all his potentates in council sate 
0	there without sign of boast or sign of joy 
0	solicitous and blank he thus began 
0	 princes heaven s ancient sons aethereal thrones 
0	daemonian spirits now from the element
0	each of his reign allotted rightlier called
0	powers of fire air water and earth beneath
0	 so may we hold our place and these mild seats
0	without new trouble such an enemy
0	is risen to invade us who no less
0	threatens than our expulsion down to hell 
0	i as i undertook and with the vote
0	consenting in full frequence was impowered 
0	have found him viewed him tasted him but find
0	far other labour to be undergone
0	than when i dealt with adam first of men 
0	though adam by his wife s allurement fell 
0	however to this man inferior far 
0	if he be man by mother s side at least
0	with more than human gifts from heaven adorned 
0	perfections absolute graces divine 
0	and amplitude of mind to greatest deeds 
0	therefore i am returned lest confidence
0	of my success with eve in paradise
0	deceive ye to persuasion over sure
0	of like succeeding here i summon all
0	rather to be in readiness with hand
0	or counsel to assist lest i who erst
0	thought none my equal now be overmatched 
0	so spake the old serpent doubting and from all
0	with clamour was assured their utmost aid
0	at his command when from amidst them rose
0	belial the dissolutest spirit that fell 
0	the sensualest and after asmodai 
0	the fleshliest incubus and thus advised 
0	 set women in his eye and in his walk 
0	among daughters of men the fairest found 
0	many are in each region passing fair
0	as the noon sky more like to goddesses
0	than mortal creatures graceful and discreet 
0	expert in amorous arts enchanting tongues
0	persuasive virgin majesty with mild
0	and sweet allayed yet terrible to approach 
0	skilled to retire and in retiring draw
0	hearts after them tangled in amorous nets 
0	such object hath the power to soften and tame
0	severest temper smooth the rugged st brow 
0	enerve and with voluptuous hope dissolve 
0	draw out with credulous desire and lead
0	at will the manliest resolutest breast 
0	as the magnetic hardest iron draws 
0	women when nothing else beguiled the heart
0	of wisest solomon and made him build 
0	and made him bow to the gods of his wives 
0	to whom quick answer satan thus returned 
0	 belial in much uneven scale thou weigh st
0	all others by thyself because of old
0	thou thyself doat st on womankind admiring
0	their shape their colour and attractive grace 
0	none are thou think st but taken with such toys 
0	before the flood thou with thy lusty crew 
0	false titled sons of god roaming the earth 
0	cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men 
0	and coupled with them and begot a race 
0	have we not seen or by relation heard 
0	in courts and regal chambers how thou lurk st 
0	in wood or grove by mossy fountain side 
0	in valley or green meadow to waylay
0	some beauty rare calisto clymene 
0	or amymone syrinx many more
0	too long then lay st thy scapes on names adored 
0	satyr or faun or silvan but these haunts
0	delight not all among the sons of men
0	how many have with a smile made small account
0	of beauty and her lures easily scorned
0	all her assaults on worthier things intent 
0	remember that pellean conqueror 
0	a youth how all the beauties of the east
0	he slightly viewed and slightly overpassed 
0	how he surnamed of africa dismissed 
0	in his prime youth the fair iberian maid 
0	for solomon he lived at ease and full
0	of honour wealth high fare aimed not beyond
0	higher design than to enjoy his state 
0	thence to the bait of women lay exposed 
0	but he whom we attempt is wiser far
0	than solomon of more exalted mind 
0	made and set wholly on the accomplishment
0	of greatest things what woman will you find 
0	though of this age the wonder and the fame 
0	on whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye
0	of fond desire or should she confident 
0	as sitting queen adored on beauty s throne 
0	descend with all her winning charms begirt
0	to enamour as the zone of venus once
0	wrought that effect on jove so fables tell 
0	how would one look from his majestic brow 
0	seated as on the top of virtue s hill 
0	discountenance her despised and put to rout
0	all her array her female pride deject 
0	or turn to reverent awe for beauty stands
0	in the admiration only of weak minds
0	led captive cease to admire and all her plumes
0	fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy 
0	at every sudden slighting quite abashed 
0	therefore with manlier objects we must try
0	his constancy with such as have more shew
0	of worth of honour glory and popular praise
0	 rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked 
0	or that which only seems to satisfy
0	lawful desires of nature not beyond 
0	and now i know he hungers where no food
0	is to be found in the wide wilderness 
0	the rest commit to me i shall let pass
0	no advantage and his strength as oft assay 
0	he ceased and heard their grant in loud acclaim 
0	then forthwith to him takes a chosen band
0	of spirits likest to himself in guile 
0	to be at hand and at his beck appear 
0	if cause were to unfold some active scene
0	of various persons each to know his part 
0	then to the desert takes with these his flight 
0	where still from shade to shade the son of god 
0	after forty days fasting had remained 
0	now hungering first and to himself thus said 
0	 where will this end four times ten days i have passed
0	wandering this woody maze and human food
0	nor tasted nor had appetite that fast
0	to virtue i impute not or count part
0	of what i suffer here if nature need not 
0	or god support nature without repast 
0	though needing what praise is it to endure 
0	but now i feel i hunger which declares
0	nature hath need of what she asks yet god
0	can satisfy that need some other way 
0	though hunger still remain so it remain
0	without this body s wasting i content me 
0	and from the sting of famine fear no harm 
0	nor mind it fed with better thoughts that feed
0	me hungering more to do my father s will 
0	it was the hour of night when thus the son
0	communed in silent walk then laid him down
0	under the hospitable covert nigh
0	of trees thick interwoven there he slept 
0	and dreamed as appetite is wont to dream 
0	of meats and drinks nature s refreshment sweet 
0	him thought he by the brook of cherith stood 
0	and saw the ravens with their horny beaks
0	food to elijah bringing even and morn 
0	though ravenous taught to abstain from what they brought 
0	he saw the prophet also how he fled
0	into the desert and how there he slept
0	under a juniper then how awaked 
0	he found his supper on the coals prepared 
0	and by the angel was bid rise and eat 
0	and eat the second time after repose 
0	the strength whereof sufficed him forty days 
0	sometimes that with elijah he partook 
0	or as a guest with daniel at his pulse 
0	thus wore out night and now the harald lark
0	left his ground nest high towering to descry
0	the morn s approach and greet her with his song 
0	as lightly from his grassy couch up rose
0	our saviour and found all was but a dream 
0	fasting he went to sleep and fasting waked 
0	up to a hill anon his steps he reared 
0	from whose high top to ken the prospect round 
0	if cottage were in view sheep cote or herd 
0	but cottage herd or sheep cote none he saw 
0	only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove 
0	with chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud 
0	thither he bent his way determined there
0	to rest at noon and entered soon the shade
0	high roofed and walks beneath and alleys brown 
0	that opened in the midst a woody scene 
0	nature s own work it seemed nature taught art 
0	and to a superstitious eye the haunt
0	of wood gods and wood nymphs he viewed it round 
0	when suddenly a man before him stood 
0	not rustic as before but seemlier clad 
0	as one in city or court or palace bred 
0	and with fair speech these words to him addressed 
0	 with granted leave officious i return 
0	but much more wonder that the son of god
0	in this wild solitude so long should bide 
0	of all things destitute and well i know 
0	not without hunger others of some note 
0	as story tells have trod this wilderness 
0	the fugitive bond woman with her son 
0	outcast nebaioth yet found here relief
0	by a providing angel all the race
0	of israel here had famished had not god
0	rained from heaven manna and that prophet bold 
0	native of thebez wandering here was fed
0	twice by a voice inviting him to eat 
0	of thee those forty days none hath regard 
0	forty and more deserted here indeed 
0	to whom thus jesus what conclud st thou hence 
0	they all had need i as thou seest have none 
0	 how hast thou hunger then satan replied 
0	 tell me if food were now before thee set 
0	wouldst thou not eat thereafter as i like
0	the giver answered jesus why should that
0	cause thy refusal said the subtle fiend 
0	 hast thou not right to all created things 
0	owe not all creatures by just right to thee
0	duty and service nor to stay till bid 
0	but tender all their power nor mention i
0	meats by the law unclean or offered first
0	to idols those young daniel could refuse 
0	nor proffered by an enemy though who
0	would scruple that with want oppressed behold 
0	nature ashamed or better to express 
0	troubled that thou shouldst hunger hath purveyed
0	from all the elements her choicest store 
0	to treat thee as beseems and as her lord
0	with honour only deign to sit and eat 
0	he spake no dream for as his words had end 
0	our saviour lifting up his eyes beheld 
0	in ample space under the broadest shade 
0	a table richly spread in regal mode 
0	with dishes piled and meats of noblest sort
0	and savour beasts of chase or fowl of game 
0	in pastry built or from the spit or boiled 
0	grisamber steamed all fish from sea or shore 
0	freshet or purling brook of shell or fin 
0	and exquisitest name for which was drained
0	pontus and lucrine bay and afric coast 
0	alas how simple to these cates compared 
0	was that crude apple that diverted eve 
0	and at a stately sideboard by the wine 
0	that fragrant smell diffused in order stood
0	tall stripling youths rich clad of fairer hue
0	than ganymed or hylas distant more 
0	under the trees now tripped now solemn stood 
0	nymphs of diana s train and naiades
0	with fruits and flowers from amalthea s horn 
0	and ladies of the hesperides that seemed
0	fairer than feigned of old or fabled since
0	of faery damsels met in forest wide
0	by knights of logres or of lyones 
0	and all the while harmonious airs were heard
0	of chiming strings or charming pipes and winds
0	of gentlest gale arabian odours fanned
0	from their soft wings and flora s earliest smells 
0	such was the splendour and the tempter now
0	his invitation earnestly renewed 
0	 what doubts the son of god to sit and eat 
0	these are not fruits forbidden no interdict
0	defends the touching of these viands pure 
0	their taste no knowledge works at least of evil 
0	but life preserves destroys life s enemy 
0	hunger with sweet restorative delight 
0	all these are spirits of air and woods and springs 
0	thy gentle ministers who come to pay
0	thee homage and acknowledge thee their lord 
0	what doubt st thou son of god sit down and eat 
0	to whom thus jesus temperately replied 
0	 said st thou not that to all things i had right 
0	and who withholds my power that right to use 
0	shall i receive by gift what of my own 
0	when and where likes me best i can command 
0	i can at will doubt not as soon as thou 
0	command a table in this wilderness 
0	and call swift flights of angels ministrant 
0	arrayed in glory on my cup to attend 
0	why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence
0	in vain where no acceptance it can find 
0	and with my hunger what hast thou to do 
0	thy pompous delicacies i contemn 
0	and count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles 
0	to whom thus answered satan male content 
0	 that i have also power to give thou seest 
0	if of that power i bring thee voluntary
0	what i might have bestowed on whom i pleased 
0	and rather opportunely in this place
0	chose to impart to thy apparent need 
0	why shouldst thou not accept it but i see
0	what i can do or offer is suspect 
0	of these things others quickly will dispose 
0	whose pains have earned the far fet spoil with that
0	both table and provision vanished quite 
0	with sound of harpies wings and talons heard 
0	only the importune tempter still remained 
0	and with these words his temptation pursued 
0	 by hunger that each other creature tames 
0	thou art not to be harmed therefore not moved 
0	thy temperance invincible besides 
0	for no allurement yields to appetite 
0	and all thy heart is set on high designs 
0	high actions but wherewith to be achieved 
0	great acts require great means of enterprise 
0	thou art unknown unfriended low of birth 
0	a carpenter thy father known thyself
0	bred up in poverty and straits at home 
0	lost in a desert here and hunger bit 
0	which way or from what hope dost thou aspire
0	to greatness whence authority deriv st 
0	what followers what retinue canst thou gain 
0	or at thy heels the dizzy multitude 
0	longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost 
0	money brings honour friends conquest and realms 
0	what raised antipater the edomite 
0	and his son herod placed on juda s throne 
0	thy throne but gold that got him puissant friends 
0	therefore if at great things thou wouldst arrive 
0	get riches first get wealth and treasure heap 
0	not difficult if thou hearken to me 
0	riches are mine fortune is in my hand 
0	they whom i favour thrive in wealth amain 
0	while virtue valour wisdom sit in want 
0	to whom thus jesus patiently replied 
0	 yet wealth without these three is impotent
0	to gain dominion or to keep it gained 
0	witness those ancient empires of the earth 
0	in highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved 
0	but men endued with these have oft attained 
0	in lowest poverty to highest deeds 
0	gideon and jephtha and the shepherd lad
0	whose offspring on the throne of juda sate
0	so many ages and shall yet regain
0	that seat and reign in israel without end 
0	among the heathen for throughout the world
0	to me is not unknown what hath been done
0	worthy of memorial canst thou not remember
0	for i esteem those names of men so poor 
0	who could do mighty things and could contemn
0	riches though offered from the hand of kings 
0	and what in me seems wanting but that i
0	may also in this poverty as soon
0	accomplish what they did perhaps and more 
0	extol not riches then the toil of fools 
0	the wise man s cumbrance if not snare more apt
0	to slacken virtue and abate her edge
0	than prompt her to do aught may merit praise 
0	what if with like aversion i reject
0	riches and realms yet not for that a crown 
0	golden in shew is but a wreath of thorns 
0	brings dangers troubles cares and sleepless nights 
0	to him who wears the regal diadem 
0	when on his shoulders each man s burden lies 
0	for therein stands the office of a king 
0	his honour virtue merit and chief praise 
0	that for the public all this weight he bears 
0	yet he who reigns within himself and rules
0	passions desires and fears is more a king 
0	which every wise and virtuous man attains 
0	and who attains not ill aspires to rule
0	cities of men or headstrong multitudes 
0	subject himself to anarchy within 
0	or lawless passions in him which he serves 
0	but to guide nations in the way of truth
0	by saving doctrine and from error lead
0	to know and knowing worship god aright 
0	is yet more kingly this attracts the soul 
0	governs the inner man the nobler part 
0	that other o er the body only reigns 
0	and oft by force which to a generous mind
0	so reigning can be no sincere delight 
0	besides to give a kingdom hath been thought
0	greater and nobler done and to lay down
0	far more magnanimous than to assume 
0	riches are needless then both for themselves 
0	and for thy reason why they should be sought 
0	to gain a sceptre oftest better missed 
0	so spake the son of god and satan stood
0	a while as mute confounded what to say 
0	what to reply confuted and convinced
0	of his weak arguing and fallacious drift 
0	at length collecting all his serpent wiles 
0	with soothing words renewed him thus accosts 
0	 i see thou know st what is of use to know 
0	what best to say canst say to do canst do 
0	thy actions to thy words accord thy words
0	to thy large heart give utterance due thy heart
0	contains of good wise just the perfet shape 
0	should kings and nations from thy mouth consult 
0	thy counsel would be as the oracle
0	urim and thummim those oraculous gems
0	on aaron s breast or tongue of seers old
0	infallible or wert thou sought to deeds
0	that might require the array of war thy skill
0	of conduct would be such that all the world
0	could not sustain thy prowess or subsist
0	in battle though against thy few in arms 
0	these godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide 
0	affecting private life or more obscure
0	in savage wilderness wherefore deprive
0	all earth her wonder at thy acts thyself
0	the fame and glory glory the reward
0	that sole excites to high attempts the flame
0	of most erected spirits most tempered pure
0	aethereal who all pleasures else despise 
0	all treasures and all gain esteem as dross 
0	and dignities and powers all but the highest 
0	thy years are ripe and over ripe the son
0	of macedonian philip had ere these
0	won asia and the throne of cyrus held
0	at his dispose young scipio had brought down
0	the carthaginian pride young pompey quelled
0	the pontic king and in triumph had rode 
0	yet years and to ripe years judgment mature 
0	quench not the thirst of glory but augment 
0	great julius whom now all the world admires 
0	the more he grew in years the more inflamed
0	with glory wept that he had lived so long
0	ingloroious but thou yet art not too late 
0	to whom our saviour calmly thus replied 
0	 thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth
0	for empire s sake nor empire to affect
0	for glory s sake by all thy argument 
0	for what is glory but the blaze of fame 
0	the people s praise if always praise unmixed 
0	and what the people but a herd confused 
0	a miscellaneous rabble who extol
0	things vulgar and well weighed scarce worth the praise 
0	they praise and they admire they know not what 
0	and know not whom but as one leads the other 
0	and what delight to be by such extolled 
0	to live upon their tongues and be their talk 
0	of whom to be dispraised were no small praise 
0	his lot who dares be singularly good 
0	the intelligent among them and the wise
0	are few and glory scarce of few is raised 
0	this is true glory and renown when god 
0	looking on the earth with approbation marks
0	the just man and divulges him through heaven
0	to all his angels who with true applause
0	recount his praises thus he did to job 
0	when to extend his fame through heaven and earth 
0	as thou to thy reproach may st well remember 
0	he asked thee hast thou seen my servant job 
0	famous he was in heaven on earth less known 
0	where glory is false glory attributed
0	to things not glorious men not worthy of fame 
0	they err who count it glorious to subdue
0	by conquest far and wide to overrun
0	large countries and in field great battles win 
0	great cities by assault what do these worthies
0	but rob and spoil burn slaughter and enslave
0	peaceable nations neighbouring or remote 
0	made captive yet deserving freedom more
0	than those their conquerors who leave behind
0	nothing but ruin wheresoe er they rove 
0	and all the flourishing works of peace destroy 
0	then swell with pride and must be titled gods 
0	great benefactors of mankind deliverers 
0	worshipped with temple priest and sacrifice 
0	one is the son of jove of mars the other 
0	till conqueror death discover them scarce men 
0	rowling in brutish vices and deformed 
0	violent or shameful death their due reward 
0	but if there be in glory aught of good 
0	it may be means far different be attained 
0	without ambition war or violence 
0	by deeds of peace by wisdom eminent 
0	by patience temperance i mention still
0	him whom thy wrongs with saintly patience borne 
0	made famous in a land and times obscure 
0	who names not now with honour patient job 
0	poor socrates who next more memorable 
0	by what he taught and suffered for so doing 
0	for truth s sake suffering death unjust lives now
0	equal in fame to proudest conquerors 
0	yet if for fame and glory aught be done 
0	aught suffered if young african for fame
0	his wasted country freed from punic rage 
0	the deed becomes unpraised the man at least 
0	and loses though but verbal his reward 
0	shall i seek glory then as vain men seek 
0	oft not deserved i seek not mine but his
0	who sent me and thereby witness whence i am 
0	to whom the tempter murmuring thus replied 
0	 think not so slight of glory therein least
0	resembling thy great father he seeks glory 
0	and for his glory all things made all things
0	orders and governs nor content in heaven 
0	by all his angels glorified requires
0	glory from men from all men good or bad 
0	wise or unwise no difference no exemption 
0	above all sacrifice or hallowed gift 
0	glory he requires and glory he receives 
0	or barbarous nor exception hath declared 
0	from us his foes pronounced glory he exacts 
0	to whom our saviour fervently replied 
0	 and reason since his word all things produced 
0	though chiefly not for glory as prime end 
0	but to shew forth his goodness and impart
0	his good communicable to every soul
0	freely of whom what could he less expect
0	than glory and benediction that is thanks 
0	the slightest easiest readiest recompense
0	from them who could return him nothing else 
0	and not returning that would likeliest render
0	contempt instead dishonour obloquy 
0	hard recompense unsuitable return
0	for so much good so much beneficience 
0	but why should man seek glory who of his own
0	hath nothing and to whom nothing belongs
0	but condemnation ignominy and shame 
0	who for so many benefits received 
0	turned recreant to god ingrate and false 
0	and so of all true good himself despoiled 
0	yet sacrilegious to himself would take
0	that which to god alone of right belongs 
0	yet so much bounty is in god such grace 
0	that who advances his glory not their own 
0	them he himself to glory will advance 
0	so spake the son of god and here again
0	satan had not to answer but stood struck
0	with guilt of his own sin for he himself 
0	insatiable of glory had lost all 
0	yet of another plea bethought him soon 
0	 of glory as thou wilt said he so deem 
0	worth or not worth the seeking let it pass 
0	but to a kingdom thou art born ordained
0	to sit upon thy father david s throne 
0	by mother s side thy father though thy right
0	be now in powerful hands that will not part
0	easily from possession won with arms 
0	reduced a province under roman yoke 
0	obeys tiberius nor is always ruled
0	with temperate sway oft have they violated
0	the temple oft the law with foul affronts 
0	abominations rather as did once
0	antiochus and think st thou to regain
0	thy right by sitting still or thus retiring 
0	so did not machabeus he indeed
0	retired unto the desert but with arms 
0	and o er a mighty king so oft prevailed
0	that by strong hand his family obtained 
0	though priests the crown and david s throne usurped 
0	with modin and her suburbs once content 
0	if kingdom move thee not let move thee zeal
0	and duty zeal and duty are not slow 
0	but on occasion s forelock watchful wait 
0	they themselves rather are occasion best 
0	zeal of thy father s house duty to free
0	thy country from her heathen servitude 
0	so shalt thou best fulfil best verify 
0	the prophets old who sung thy endless reign 
0	the happier reign the sooner it begins 
0	rein then what canst thou better do the while 
0	to whom our saviour answer thus returned 
0	 all things are best fulfilled in their due time 
0	and time there is for all things truth hath said 
0	if of my reign prophetic writ hath told
0	that it shall never end so when begin
0	the father in his purpose hath decreed 
0	he in whose hand all times and seasons rowl 
0	what if he hath decreed that i shall first
0	be tried in humble state and things adverse 
0	by tribulations injuries insults 
0	contempts and scorns and snares and violence 
0	suffering abstaining quietly expecting
0	without distrust or doubt that he may know
0	what i can suffer how obey who best
0	can suffer best can do best reign who first
0	well hath obeyed just trial ere i merit
0	my exaltation without change or end 
0	but what concerns it thee when i begin
0	my everlasting kingdom why art thou
0	solicitous what moves thy inquisition 
0	know st thou not that my rising is thy fall 
0	and my promotion will be thy destruction 
0	to whom the tempter inly racked replied 
0	 let that come when it comes all hope is lost
0	of my reception into grace what worse 
0	for where no hope is left is left no fear 
0	if there be worse the expectation more
0	of worse torments me than the feeling can 
0	i would be at the worst worst is my port 
0	my harbour and my ultimate repose 
0	the end i would attain my final good 
0	my error was my error and my crime
0	my crime whatever for itself condemned 
0	and will alike be punished whether thou
0	reign or reign not though to that gentle brow
0	willingly i could fly and hope thy reign 
0	from that placid aspect and meek regard 
0	rather than aggravate my evil state 
0	would stand between me and thy father s ire
0	 whose ire i dread more than the fire of hell 
0	a shelter and a kind of shading cool
0	interposition as a summer s cloud 
0	if i then to the worst that can be haste 
0	why move thy feet so slow to what is best 
0	happiest both to thyself and all the world 
0	that thou who worthiest art shouldst be their king 
0	perhaps thou linger st in deep thoughts detained
0	of the enterprise so hazardous and high 
0	no wonder for though in thee be united
0	what of perfection can in man be found 
0	or human nature can receive consider
0	thy life hath yet been private most part spent
0	at home scarce viewed the galilean towns 
0	and once a year jerusalem few days 
0	short sojourn and what thence couldst thou observe 
0	the world thou hast not seen much less her glory 
0	empires and monarchs and their radiant courts 
0	best school of best experience quickest in sight
0	in all things that to greatest actions lead 
0	the wisest unexperienced will be ever
0	timorous and loth with novice modesty
0	 as he who seeking asses found a kingdom 
0	irresolute unhardy unadventrous 
0	but i will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit
0	those rudiments and see before thine eyes
0	the monarchies of the earth their pomp and state 
0	sufficient introduction to inform
0	thee of thyself so apt in regal arts 
0	and regal mysteries that thou may st know
0	how best their opposition to withstand 
0	with that such power was given him then he took
0	the son of god up to a mountain high 
0	it was a mountain at whose verdant feet
0	a spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide
0	lay pleasant from his side two rivers flowed 
0	the one winding the other straight and left between
0	fair champaign with less rivers interveined 
0	then meeting joined their tribute to the sea 
0	fertil of corn the glebe of oil and wine 
0	with herds the pasture thronged with flocks the hills 
0	huge cities and high towered that well might seem
0	the seats of mightiest monarchs and so large
0	the prospect was that here and there was room
0	for barren desert fountainless and dry 
0	to this high mountain top the tempter brought
0	our saviour and new train of words began 
0	 well have we speeded and o er hill and dale 
0	forest and field and flood temples and towers 
0	cut shorter many a league here thou behold st
0	assyria and her empire s ancient bounds 
0	araxes and the caspian lake thence on
0	as far as indus east euphrates west 
0	and oft beyond to south the persian bay 
0	and inaccessible the arabian drouth 
0	here nineveh of length within her wall
0	several days journey built by ninus old 
0	of that first golden monarchy the seat 
0	and seat of salmanassar whose success
0	israel in long captivity still mourns 
0	there babylon the wonder of all tongues 
0	as ancient but rebuilt by him who twice
0	judah and all thy father david s house
0	led captive and jerusalem laid waste 
0	till cyrus set them free persepolis 
0	his city there thou seest and bactra there 
0	ecbatana her structure vast there shews 
0	and hecatompylos her hunderd gates 
0	there susa by choaspes amber stream 
0	the drink of none but kings of later fame 
0	built by emathian or by parthian hands 
0	the great seleucia nisibis and there
0	turning with easy eye thou may st behold 
0	all these the parthian now some ages past
0	by great arsaces led who founded first
0	that empire under his dominion holds 
0	from the luxurious kings of antioch won 
0	and just in time thou com st to have a view
0	of his great power for now the parthian king
0	in ctesiphon hath gathered all his host
0	against the scythian whose incursions wild
0	have wasted sogdiana to her aid
0	he marches now in haste see though from far 
0	his thousands in what martial equipage
0	they issue forth steel bows and shafts their arms 
0	of equal dread in flight or in pursuit 
0	all horsemen in which fight they most excel 
0	see how in warlike muster they appear 
0	in rhombs and wedges and half moons and wings 
0	he looked and saw what numbers numberless
0	the city gates outpoured light armed troops
0	in coats of mail and military pride 
0	in mail their horses clad yet fleet and strong 
0	prauncing their riders bore the flower and choice
0	of many provinces from bound to bound 
0	from arachosia from candaor east 
0	and margiana to the hyrcanian cliffs
0	of caucasus and dark iberian dales 
0	from atropatia and the neighbouring plains
0	of adiabene media and the south
0	of susiana to balsara s haven 
0	he saw them in their forms of battle ranged 
0	how quick they wheeled and flying behind them shot
0	sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face
0	of their pursuers and overcame by flight 
0	the field all iron cast a gleaming brown 
0	nor wanted clouds of foot nor on each horn 
0	cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight 
0	chariots or elephants indorsed with towers
0	of archers nor of labouring pioners
0	to lay hills plain fell woods or valleys fill 
0	or where plain was raise hill or overlay
0	with bridges rivers proud as with a yoke 
0	mules after these camels and dromedaries 
0	and waggons fraught with utensils of war 
0	such forces met not nor so wide a camp 
0	when agrican with all his northern powers 
0	besieged albracea as romances tell 
0	the city of gallaphrone from thence to win
0	the fairest of her sex angelica 
0	his daughter sought by many prowest knights 
0	both paynim and the peers of charlemane 
0	such and so numerous was their chivalry 
0	at sight whereof the fiend yet more presumed 
0	and to our saviour thus his words renewed 
0	 that thou may st know i seek not to engage
0	thy virtue and not every way secure
0	on no slight grounds thy safety hear and mark
0	to what end i have brought thee hither and shew
0	all this fair sight thy kingdom though foretold
0	by prophet or by angel unless thou
0	endeavour as thy father david did 
0	thou never shalt obtain prediction still
0	in all things and all men supposes means 
0	without means used what it predicts revokes 
0	but say thou wert possessed of david s throne
0	by free consent of all none opposite 
0	long to enjoy it quiet and secure
0	between two such enclosing enemies 
0	roman and parthian therefore one of these
0	thou must make sure thy own the parthian first 
0	by my advice as nearer and of late
0	found able by invasion to annoy
0	thy country and captive lead away her kings 
0	antigonus and old hyrcanus bound 
0	maugre the roman it shall be my task
0	to render thee the parthian at dispose 
0	choose which thou wilt by conquest or by league 
0	by him thou shalt regain without him not 
0	that which alone can truly reinstall thee
0	in david s royal seat his true successor 
0	deliverance of thy brethren those ten tribes
0	whose offspring in his territory yet serve
0	in habor and among the medes dispersed 
0	the sons of jacob two of joseph lost
0	thus long from israel serving as of old
0	this offer sets before thee to deliver 
0	these if from servitude thou shalt restore
0	to their inheritance then nor till then 
0	thou on the throne of david in full glory 
0	shalt reign and rome or caesar not need fear 
0	to whom our saviour answered thus unmoved 
0	 much ostentation vain of fleshly arm
0	and fragile arms much instrument of war 
0	long in preparing soon to nothing brought 
0	before mine eyes thou hast set and in my ear
0	vented much policy and projects deep
0	of enemies of aids battles and leagues 
0	plausible to the world to me worth naught 
0	means i must use thou say st prediction else
0	will unpredict and fail me of the throne 
0	my time i told thee and that time for thee
0	were better farthest off is not yet come 
0	when that comes think not thou to find me slack
0	on my part aught endeavouring or to need
0	thy politic maxims or that cumbersome
0	luggage of war there shewn me argument
0	of human weakness rather than of strength 
0	my brethren as thou call st them those ten tribes 
0	i must deliver if i mean to reign
0	david s true heir and his full sceptre sway
0	to just extent over all israel s sons 
0	but whence to thee this zeal where was it then
0	for israel or for david or his throne 
0	when thou stood st up his tempter to the pride
0	of numbering israel which cost the lives
0	of threescore and ten thousand israelites
0	by three days pestilence such was thy zeal
0	to israel then the same that now to me 
0	as for those captive tribes themselves were they
0	who wrought their own captivity fell off
0	from god to worship calves the deities
0	and all the idolatries of heathen round 
0	besides their other worse than heathenish crimes 
0	nor in the land of their captivity
0	humbled themselves or penitent besought
0	the god of their forefathers but so died
0	impenitent and left a race behind
0	like to themselves distinguishable scarce
0	from gentiles but by circumcision vain 
0	and god with idols in their worship joined 
0	should i of these the liberty regard 
0	who freed as to their ancient patrimony 
0	unhumbled unrepentant unreformed 
0	headlong would follow and to their gods perhaps
0	of bethel and of dan no let them serve
0	their enemies who serve idols with god 
0	yet he at length time to himself best known 
0	remembering abraham by some wondrous call
0	may bring them back repentant and sincere 
0	and at their passing cleave the assyrian flood 
0	while to their native land with joy they haste 
0	as the red sea and jordan once he cleft 
0	when to the promised land their fathers passed 
0	to his due time and providence i leave them 
0	so spake israel s true king and to the fiend
0	made answer meet that made void all his wiles 
0	so fares it when with truth falsehood contends 
0	perplexed and troubled at his bad success
0	the tempter stood nor had what to reply 
0	discovered in his fraud thrown from his hope
0	so oft and the persuasive rhetoric
0	that sleeked his tongue and won so much on eve 
0	so little here nay lost but eve was eve 
0	this far his over match who self deceived
0	and rash beforehand had no better weighed
0	the strength he was to cope with or his own 
0	but as a man who had been matchless held
0	in cunning over reached where least he thought 
0	to salve his credit and for very spite 
0	still will be tempting him who foils him still 
0	and never cease though to his shame the more 
0	or as a swarm of flies in vintage time 
0	about the wine press where sweet must is poured 
0	beat off returns as oft with humming sound 
0	or surging waves against a solid rock 
0	though all to shivers dashed the assault renew 
0	 vain battery and in froth or bubbles end 
0	so satan whom repulse upon repulse
0	met ever and to shameful silence brought 
0	yet gives not o er though desperate of success 
0	and his vain importunity pursues 
0	he brought our saviour to the western side
0	of that high mountain whence he might behold
0	another plain long but in breadth not wide 
0	washed by the southern sea and on the north
0	to equal length backed with a ridge of hills
0	that screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men
0	from cold septentrion blasts thence in the midst
0	divided by a river off whose banks
0	on each side an imperial city stood 
0	with towers and temples proudly elevate
0	on seven small hills with palaces adorned 
0	porches and theatres baths aqueducts 
0	statues and trophies and triumphal arcs 
0	gardens and groves presented to his eyes
0	above the highth of mountains interposed 
0	by what strange parallax or optic skill
0	of vision multiplied through air or glass
0	of telescope were curious to enquire 
0	and now the tempter thus his silence broke 
0	 the city which thou seest no other deem
0	than great and glorious rome queen of the earth
0	so far renowned and with the spoils enriched
0	of nations there the capitol thou seest 
0	above the rest lifting his stately head
0	on the tarpeian rock her citadel
0	impregnable and there mount palatine 
0	the imperial palace compass huge and high
0	the structure skill of noblest architects 
0	with gilded battlements conspicuous far 
0	turrets and terraces and glittering spires 
0	many a fair edifice besides more like
0	houses of gods so well i have disposed
0	my aerie microscope thou may st behold 
0	outside and inside both pillars and roofs
0	carved work the hand of famed artificers
0	in cedar marble ivory or gold 
0	thence to the gates cast round thine eye and see
0	what conflux issuing forth or entering in 
0	praetors proconsuls to their provinces
0	hasting or on return in robes of state 
0	lictors and rods the ensigns of their power 
0	legions and cohorts turms of horse and wings 
0	or embassies from regions far remote 
0	in various habits on the appian road 
0	or on the aemilian some from farthest south 
0	syene and where the shadow both way falls 
0	meroe nilotic isle and more to west 
0	the realm of bocchus to the blackmoor sea

0	dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed 
0	from gallia gades and the british west 
0	germans and scythians and sarmatians north
0	beyond danubius to the tauric pool 
0	all nations now to rome obedience pay 
0	to rome s great emperor whose wide domain 
0	in ample territory wealth and power 
0	civility of manners arts and arms 
0	and long renown thou justly may st prefer
0	before the parthian these two thrones except 
0	the rest are barbarous and scarce worth the sight 
0	shared among petty kings too far removed 
0	these having shewn thee i have shewn thee all
0	the kingdoms of the world and all their glory 
0	this emperor hath no son and now is old 
0	old and lascivious and from rome retired
0	to capreae an island small but strong
0	on the campanian shore with purpose there
0	his horrid lusts in private to enjoy 
0	committing to a wicked favourite
0	all public cares and yet of him suspicious 
0	hated of all and hating with what ease 
0	endued with regal virtues as thou art 
0	appearing and beginning noble deeds 
0	might st thou expel this monster from his throne 
0	now made a sty and in his place ascending 
0	a victor people free from servile yoke 
0	and with my help thou may st to me the power
0	is given and by that right i give it thee 
0	aim therefore at no less than all the world 
0	aim at the highest without the highest attained 
0	will be for thee no sitting or not long 
0	on david s throne be prophesied what will 
0	to whom the son of god unmoved replied 
0	 nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew
0	of luxury though called magnificence 
0	more than of arms before allure mine eye 
0	much less my mind though thou should st add to tell
0	their sumptuous gluttonies and gorgeous feasts
0	on citron tables or atlantic stone
0	 for i have also heard perhaps have read 
0	their wines of setia cales and falerne 
0	chios and crete and how they quaff in gold 
0	crystal and myrrhine cups imbossed with gems
0	and studs of pearl to me should st tell who thirst
0	and hunger still then embassies thou shew st
0	from nations far and nigh what honour that 
0	but tedious waste of time to sit and hear
0	so many hollow compliments and lies 
0	outlandish flatteries then proceed st to talk
0	of the emperor how easily subdued 
0	how gloriously i shall thou say st expel
0	a brutish monster what if i withal
0	expel a devil who first made him such 
0	let his tormentor conscience find him out 
0	for him i was not sent nor yet to free
0	that people victor once now vile and base 
0	deservedly made vassal who once just 
0	frugal and mild and temperate conquered well 
0	but govern ill the nations under yoke 
0	peeling their provinces exhausted all
0	by lust and rapine first ambitious grown
0	of triumph that insulting vanity 
0	then cruel by their sports to blood inured
0	of fighting beasts and men to beasts exposed 
0	luxurious by their wealth and greedier still 
0	and from the daily scene effeminate 
0	what wise and valiant man would seek to free
0	these thus degenerate by themselves enslaved 
0	or could of inward slaves make outward free 
0	know therefore when my season comes to sit
0	on david s throne it shall be like a tree
0	spreading and overshadowing all the earth 
0	or as a stone that shall to pieces dash
0	all monarchies besides throughout the world 
0	and of my kingdom there shall be no end 
0	means there shall be to this but what the means
0	is not for thee to know nor me to tell 
0	to whom the tempter impudent replied 
0	 i see all offers made by me how slight
0	thou valuest because offered and reject st 
0	nothing will please the difficult and nice 
0	or nothing more than still to contradict 
0	on the other side know also thou that i
0	on what i offer set as high esteem 
0	nor what i part with mean to give for naught 
0	all these which in a moment thou behold st 
0	the kingdoms of the world to thee i give
0	 for given to me i give to whom i please 
0	no trifle yet with this reserve not else 
0	on this condition if thou wilt fall down 
0	and worship me as thy superior lord
0	 easily done and hold them all of me 
0	for what can less so great a gift deserve 
0	whom thus our saviour answered with disdain 
0	 i never liked thy talk thy offers less 
0	now both abhor since thou hast dared to utter
0	the abominable terms impious condition 
0	but i endure the time till which expired
0	thou hast permission on me it is written 
0	the first of all commandments thou shalt worship
0	the lord thy god and only him shalt serve 
0	and dar st thou to the son of god propound
0	to worship thee accursed now more accursed
0	for this attempt bolder than that on eve 
0	and more blasphemous which expect to rue 
0	the kingdoms of the world to thee were given 
0	permitted rather and by thee usurped 
0	other donation none thou canst produce 
0	if given by whom but by the king of kings 
0	god over all supreme if given to thee 
0	by thee how fairly is the giver now
0	repaid but gratitude in thee is lost
0	long since wert thou so void of fear or shame
0	as offer them to me the son of god 
0	to me my own on such abhorred pact 
0	that i fall down and worship thee as god 
0	get thee behind me plain thou now appear st
0	that evil one satan for ever damned 
0	to whom the fiend with fear abashed replied 
0	 be not so sore offended son of god 
0	though sons of god both angels are and men 
0	if i to try whether in higher sort
0	than these thou bear st that title have proposed
0	what both from men and angels i receive 
0	nations besides from all the quartered winds 
0	god of this world invoked and world beneath 
0	who then thou art whose coming is foretold
0	to me most fatal me it most concerns 
0	the trial hath indamaged thee no way 
0	rather more honour left and more esteem 
0	me naught advantaged missing what i aimed 
0	therefore let pass as they are transitory 
0	the kingdoms of this world i shall no more
0	advise thee gain them as thou canst or not 
0	and thou thyself seem st otherwise inclined
0	than to a worldly crown addicted more
0	to contemplation and profound dispute 
0	as by that early action may be judged 
0	when slipping from thy mother s eye thou went st
0	alone into the temple there wast found
0	among the gravest rabbies disputant
0	on points and questions fitting moses chair 
0	teaching not taught the childhood shews the man 
0	as morning shews the day be famous then 
0	by wisdom as thy empire must extend 
0	so let extend thy mind o er all the world

0	all knowledge is not couched in moses law 
0	the pentateuch or what the prophets wrote 
0	the gentiles also know and write and teach
0	to admiration led by nature s light 
0	and with the gentiles much thou must converse 
0	ruling them by persuasion as thou mean st 
0	without their learning how wilt thou with them 
0	or they with thee hold conversation meet 
0	how wilt thou reason with them how refute
0	their idolisms traditions paradoxes 
0	error by his own arms is best evinced 
0	look once more ere we leave this specular mount 
0	westward much nearer by south west behold

0	there flowery hill hymettus with the sound
0	of bees industrious murmur oft invites
0	to studious musing there ilissus rowls

0	the schools of ancient sages his who bred
0	great alexander to subdue the world 
0	there thou shalt hear and learn the secret power
0	of harmony in tones and numbers hit
0	by voice or hand and various measured verse 
0	aeolian charms and dorian lyric odes 
0	and his who gave them breath but higher sung 
0	blind melesigenes thence homer called

0	in chorus or iambic teachers best
0	of moral prudence with delight received
0	in brief sententious precepts while they treat
0	of fate and chance and change in human life

0	these rules will render thee a king complete
0	within thyself much more with empire joined 
0	to whom our saviour sagely thus replied 
0	 think not but that i know these things or think
0	i know them not not therefore am i short
0	of knowing what i ought he who receives
0	light from above from the fountain of light 
0	no other doctrine needs though granted true 
0	but these are false or little else but dreams 
0	conjectures fancies built on nothing firm 
0	the first and wisest of them all professed
0	to know this only that he nothing knew 
0	the next to fabling fell and smooth conceits 
0	a third sort doubted all things though plain sense 
0	others in virtue placed felicity 
0	but virtue joined with riches and long life 
0	in corporal pleasure he and careless ease 
0	the stoic last in philosophic pride 
0	by him called virtue and his virtuous man 
0	wise perfect in himself and all possessing 
0	equal to god oft shames not to prefer 
0	as fearing god nor man contemning all
0	wealth pleasure pain or torment death and life 
0	which when he lists he leaves or boasts he can 
0	for all his tedious talk is but vain boast 
0	or subtle shifts conviction to evade 
0	alas what can they teach and not mislead 
0	ignorant of themselves of god much more 
0	and how the world began and how man fell 
0	degraded by himself on grace depending 
0	much of the soul they talk but all awry 
0	and in themselves seek virtue and to themselves
0	all glory arrogate to god give none 
0	rather accuse him under usual names 
0	fortune and fate as one regardless quite
0	of mortal things who therefore seeks in these
0	true wisdom finds her not or by delusion
0	far worse her false resemblance only meets 
0	an empty cloud however many books 
0	wise men have said are wearisome who reads
0	incessantly and to his reading brings not
0	a spirit and judgment equal or superior 
0	 and what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek 
0	uncertain and unsettled still remains 
0	deep versed in books and shallow in himself 
0	crude or intoxicate collecting toys
0	and trifles for choice matters worth a sponge 
0	as children gathering pebbles on the shore 
0	or if i would delight my private hours
0	with music or with poem where so soon
0	as in our native language can i find
0	that solace all our law and story strewed
0	with hymns our psalms with artful terms inscribed 
0	our hebrew songs and harps in babylon
0	that pleased so well our victor s ear declare
0	that rather greece from us these arts derived 
0	ill imitated while they loudest sing
0	the vices of their deities and their own 
0	in fable hymn or song so personating
0	their gods ridiculous and themselves past shame 
0	remove their swelling epithetes thick laid
0	as varnish on a harlot s cheek the rest 
0	thin sown with aught of profit or delight 
0	will far be found unworthy to compare
0	with sion s songs to all true tastes excelling 
0	where god is praised aright and godlike men 
0	 such are from god inspired not such from thee 
0	unless where moral virtue is expressed
0	by light of nature not in all quite lost 
0	their orators thou then extoll st as those
0	the top of eloquence statists indeed

0	than all the oratory of greece and rome 
0	in them is plainest taught and easiest learnt 
0	what makes a nation happy and keeps it so 
0	what ruins kingdoms and lays cities flat 
0	these only with our law best form a king 
0	so spake the son of god but satan now
0	quite at a loss for all his darts were spent 
0	thus to our saviour with stern brow replied 
0	 since neither wealth nor honour arms nor arts 
0	kingdom nor empire pleases thee nor aught
0	by me proposed in life contemplative
0	or active tended on by glory or fame 
0	what dost thou in this world the wilderness
0	for thee is fittest place i found thee there 
0	and thither will return thee yet remember
0	what i foretell thee soon thou shalt have cause
0	to wish thou never hadst rejected thus
0	nicely or cautiously my offered aid 
0	which would have set thee in short time with ease
0	on david s throne or throne of all the world 
0	now at full age fulness of time thy season 
0	when prophecies of thee are best fulfilled 
0	now contrary if i read aught in heaven 
0	or heaven write aught of fate by what the stars
0	voluminous or single characters
0	in their conjunction met give me to spell 
0	sorrows and labours opposition hate 
0	attends thee scorns reproaches injuries 
0	violence and stripes and lastly cruel death 
0	a kingdom they portend thee but what kingdom 
0	real or allegoric i discern not 
0	nor when eternal sure as without end 
0	without beginning for no date prefixed
0	directs me in the starry rubric set 
0	so saying he took for still he knew his power
0	not yet expired and to the wilderness
0	brought back the son of god and left him there 
0	feigning to disappear darkness now rose 
0	as daylight sunk and brought in louring night 
0	her shadowy offspring unsubstantial both 
0	privation mere of light and absent day 
0	our saviour meek and with untroubled mind
0	after hisaerie jaunt though hurried sore 
0	hungry and cold betook him to his rest 
0	wherever under some concourse of shades 
0	whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield
0	from dews and damps of night his sheltered head 
0	but sheltered slept in vain for at his head
0	the tempter watched and soon with ugly dreams
0	disturbed his sleep and either tropic now
0	 gan thunder and both ends of heaven the clouds
0	from many a horrid rift abortive poured
0	fierce rain with lightning mixed water with fire 
0	in ruin reconciled nor slept the winds
0	within their stony caves but rushed abroad
0	from the four hinges of the world and fell
0	on the vexed wilderness whose tallest pines 
0	though rooted deep as high and sturdiest oaks 
0	bowed their stiff necks loaden with stormy blasts 
0	or torn up sheer ill wast thou shrouded then 
0	o patient son of god yet only stood st
0	unshaken nor yet staid the terror there 
0	infernal ghosts and hellish furies round
0	environed thee some howled some yelled some shrieked 
0	some bent at thee their fiery darts while thou
0	sat st unappalled in calm and sinless peace 
0	thus passed the night so foul till morning fair
0	came forth with pilgrim steps in amice grey 
0	who with her radiant finger stilled the roar
0	of thunder chased the clouds and laid the winds 
0	and griesly spectres which the fiend had raised
0	to tempt the son of god with terrors dire 
0	and now the sun with more effectual beams
0	had cheered the face of earth and dried the wet
0	from drooping plant or dropping tree the birds 
0	who all things now behold more fresh and green 
0	after a night of storm so ruinous 
0	cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray 
0	to gratulate the sweet return of morn 
0	nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn 
0	was absent after all his mischief done 
0	the prince of darkness glad would also seem
0	of this fair change and to our saviour came 
0	yet with no new device they all were spent 
0	rather by this his last affront resolved 
0	desperate of better course to vent his rage
0	and mad despite to be so oft repelled 
0	him walking on a sunny hill he found 
0	backed on the north and west by a thick wood 
0	out of the wood he starts in wonted shape 
0	and in a careless mood thus to him said 
0	 fair morning yet betides thee son of god 
0	after a dismal night i heard the wrack 
0	as earth and sky would mingle but myself
0	was distant and these flaws though mortals fear them 
0	as dangerous to the pillared frame of heaven 
0	or to the earth s dark basis underneath 
0	are to the main as inconsiderable
0	and harmless if not wholesome as a sneeze
0	to man s less universe and soon are gone 
0	yet as being ofttimes noxious where they light
0	on man beast plant wasteful and turbulent 
0	like turbulencies in the affairs of men 
0	over whose heads they roar and seem to point 
0	they oft fore signify and threaten ill 
0	this tempest at this desert most was bent 
0	of men at thee for only thou here dwell st 
0	did i not tell thee if thou didst reject
0	the perfect season offered with my aid
0	to win thy destined seat but wilt prolong
0	all to the push of fate pursue thy way
0	of gaining david s throne no man knows when
0	 for both the when and how is nowhere told 
0	thou shalt be what thou art ordained no doubt 
0	for angels have proclaimed it but concealing
0	the time and means each act is rightliest done
0	not when it must but when it may be best 
0	if thou observe not this be sure to find
0	what i foretold thee many a hard assay
0	of dangers and adversities and pains 
0	ere thou of israel s sceptre get fast hold 
0	whereof this ominous night that closed thee round 
0	so many terrors voices prodigies 
0	may warn thee as a sure foregoing sign 
0	so talked he while the son of god went on 
0	and staid not but in brief him answered thus 
0	 me worse than wet thou find st not other harm
0	those terrors which thou speak st of did me none 
0	i never feared they could though noising loud
0	and threatening nigh what they can do as signs
0	betokening or ill boding i contemn
0	as false portents not sent from god but thee 
0	who knowing i shall reign past thy preventing 
0	obtrud st thy offered aid that i accepting 
0	at least might seem to hold all power of thee 
0	ambitious spirit and would st be thought my god 
0	and storm st refused thinking to terrify
0	me to thy will desist thou art discerned 
0	and toil st in vain nor me in vain molest 
0	to whom the fiend now swoln with rage replied 
0	 then hear o son of david virgin born 
0	for son of god to me is yet in doubt 
0	of the messiah i have heard foretold
0	by all the prophets of thy birth at length
0	announced by gabriel with the first i knew 
0	and of the angelic song in bethlehem field 
0	on thy birth night that sung thee saviour born 
0	from that time seldom have i ceased to eye
0	thy infancy thy childhood and thy youth 
0	thy manhood last though yet in private bred 
0	till at the ford of jordan whither all
0	flocked to the baptist i among the rest
0	 though not to be baptized by voice from heaven
0	heard thee pronounced the son of god beloved 
0	thenceforth i thought thee worth my nearer view
0	and narrower scrutiny that i might learn
0	in what degree or meaning thou art called
0	the son of god which bears no single sense 
0	the son of god i also am or was 
0	and if i was i am relation stands 
0	all men are sons of god yet thee i thought
0	in some respect far higher so declared 
0	therefore i watched thy footsteps from that hour 
0	and followed thee still on to this waste wild 
0	where by all best conjectures i collect
0	thou art to be my fatal enemy 
0	good reason then if i beforehand seek
0	to understand my adversary who
0	and what he is his wisdom power intent 
0	by parle or composition truce or league 
0	to win him or win from him what i can 
0	and opportunity i here have had
0	to try thee sift thee and confess have found thee
0	proof against all temptation as a rock
0	of adamant and as a centre firm
0	to the utmost of mere man both wise and good 
0	not more for honours riches kingdoms glory 
0	have been before contemned and may again 
0	therefore to know what more thou art than man 
0	worth naming the son of god by voice from heaven 
0	another method i must now begin 
0	so saying he caught him up and without wing
0	of hippogrif bore through the air sublime 
0	over the wilderness and o er the plain 
0	till underneath them fair jerusalem 
0	the holy city lifted high her towers 
0	and higher yet the glorious temple reared
0	her pile far off appearing like a mount
0	of alablaster topt with golden spires 
0	there on the highest pinnacle he set
0	the son of god and added thus in scorn 
0	 there stand if thou wilt stand to stand upright
0	will ask thee skill i to thy father s house
0	have brought thee and highest placed highest is best 
0	now shew thy progeny if not to stand 
0	cast thyself down safely if son of god 
0	for it is written he will give command
0	concerning thee to his angels in their hands
0	they shall uplift thee lest at any time
0	thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone 
0	to whom thus jesus also it is written 
0	 tempt not the lord thy god he said and stood 
0	but satan smitten with amazement fell 
0	as when earth s son antaeus to compare
0	small things with greatest in irassa strove
0	with jove s alcides and oft foiled still rose 
0	receiving from his mother earth new strength 
0	fresh from his fall and fiercer grapple joined 
0	throttled at length in the air expired and fell 
0	so after many a foil the tempter proud 
0	renewing fresh assaults amidst his pride
0	fell whence he stood to see his victor fall 
0	and as that theban monster that proposed
0	her riddle and him who solved it not devoured 
0	that once found out and solved for grief and spite
0	cast herself headlong from the ismenian steep 
0	so strook with dread and anguish fell the fiend 
0	and to his crew that sat consulting brought
0	joyless triumphals of his hoped success 
0	ruin and desperation and dismay 
0	who durst so proudly tempt the son of god 
0	so satan fell and straight a fiery globe
0	of angels on full sail of wing flew nigh 
0	who on their plumy vans received him soft
0	from his uneasy station and upbore 
0	as on a floating couch through the blithe air 
0	then in a flowery valley set him down
0	on a green bank and set before him spread
0	a table of celestial food divine
0	ambrosial fruits fetched from the tree of life 
0	and from the fount of life ambrosial drink 
0	that soon refreshed him wearied and repaired
0	what hunger if aught hunger had impaired 
0	or thirst and as he fed angelic quires
0	sung heavenly anthems of his victory
0	over temptation and the tempter proud 
0	 true image of the father whether throned
0	in the bosom of bliss and light of light
0	conceiving or remote from heaven enshrined
0	in fleshly tabernacle and human form 
0	wandering the wilderness whatever place 
0	habit or state or motion still expressing
0	the son of god with godlike force endued
0	against the attempter of thy father s throne
0	and thief of paradise him long of old
0	thou didst debel and down from heaven cast
0	with all his army now thou hast avenged
0	supplanted adam and by vanquishing
0	temptation hast regained lost paradise 
0	and frustrated the conquest fraudulent 
0	he never more henceforth will dare set foot
0	in paradise to tempt his snares are broke 
0	for though that seat of earthly bliss be failed 
0	a fairer paradise is founded now
0	for adam and his chosen sons whom thou 
0	a saviour art come down to reinstall 
0	where they shall dwell secure when time shall be 
0	of tempter and temptation without fear 
0	but thou infernal serpent shalt not long
0	rule in the clouds like an autumnal star 
0	or lightning thou shalt fall from heaven trod down
0	under his feet for proof ere this thou feel st
0	thy wound yet not thy last and deadliest wound 
0	by this repulse received and hold st in hell
0	no triumph in all her gates abaddon rues
0	thy bold attempt hereafter learn with awe
0	to dread the son of god he all unarmed 
0	shall chase thee with the terror of his voice 
0	from thy demoniac holds possession foul 
0	thee and thy legions yelling they shall fly 
0	and beg to hide them in a herd of swine 
0	lest he command them down into the deep 
0	bound and to torment sent before their time 
0	hail son of the most high heir of both worlds 
0	queller of satan on thy glorious work
0	now enter and begin to save mankind 
0	thus they the son of god our saviour meek 
0	sung victor and from heavenly feast refreshed 
0	brought on his way with joy he unobserved 
0	home to his mother s house private returned 
0	of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
0	brought death into the world and all our woe 
0	with loss of eden till one greater man
0	restore us and regain the blissful seat 
0	sing heavenly muse that on the secret top
0	of oreb or of sinai didst inspire
0	that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
0	in the beginning how the heavens and earth
0	rose out of chaos or if sion hill
0	delight thee more and siloa s brook that flowed
0	fast by the oracle of god i thence
0	invoke thy aid to my adventurous song 
0	that with no middle flight intends to soar
0	above th aonian mount while it pursues
0	things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme 
0	and chiefly thou o spirit that dost prefer
0	before all temples th upright heart and pure 
0	instruct me for thou know st thou from the first
0	wast present and with mighty wings outspread 
0	dove like sat st brooding on the vast abyss 
0	and mad st it pregnant what in me is dark
0	illumine what is low raise and support 
0	that to the height of this great argument 
0	i may assert eternal providence 
0	and justify the ways of god to men 
0	say first for heaven hides nothing from thy view 
0	nor the deep tract of hell say first what cause
0	moved our grand parents in that happy state 
0	favoured of heaven so highly to fall off
0	from their creator and transgress his will
0	for one restraint lords of the world besides 
0	who first seduced them to that foul revolt 
0	th infernal serpent he it was whose guile 
0	stirred up with envy and revenge deceived
0	the mother of mankind what time his pride
0	had cast him out from heaven with all his host
0	of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring
0	to set himself in glory above his peers 
0	he trusted to have equalled the most high 
0	if he opposed and with ambitious aim
0	against the throne and monarchy of god 
0	raised impious war in heaven and battle proud 
0	with vain attempt him the almighty power
0	hurled headlong flaming from th ethereal sky 
0	with hideous ruin and combustion down
0	to bottomless perdition there to dwell
0	in adamantine chains and penal fire 
0	who durst defy th omnipotent to arms 
0	nine times the space that measures day and night
0	to mortal men he with his horrid crew 
0	lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf 
0	confounded though immortal but his doom
0	reserved him to more wrath for now the thought
0	both of lost happiness and lasting pain
0	torments him round he throws his baleful eyes 
0	that witnessed huge affliction and dismay 
0	mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate 
0	at once as far as angels ken he views
0	the dismal situation waste and wild 
0	a dungeon horrible on all sides round 
0	as one great furnace flamed yet from those flames
0	no light but rather darkness visible
0	served only to discover sights of woe 
0	regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace
0	and rest can never dwell hope never comes
0	that comes to all but torture without end
0	still urges and a fiery deluge fed
0	with ever burning sulphur unconsumed 
0	such place eternal justice has prepared
0	for those rebellious here their prison ordained
0	in utter darkness and their portion set 
0	as far removed from god and light of heaven
0	as from the centre thrice to th utmost pole 
0	oh how unlike the place from whence they fell 
0	there the companions of his fall o erwhelmed
0	with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire 
0	he soon discerns and weltering by his side 
0	one next himself in power and next in crime 
0	long after known in palestine and named
0	beelzebub to whom th arch enemy 
0	and thence in heaven called satan with bold words
0	breaking the horrid silence thus began 
0	 if thou beest he but o how fallen how changed
0	from him who in the happy realms of light
0	clothed with transcendent brightness didst outshine
0	myriads though bright if he whom mutual league 
0	united thoughts and counsels equal hope
0	and hazard in the glorious enterprise
0	joined with me once now misery hath joined
0	in equal ruin into what pit thou seest
0	from what height fallen so much the stronger proved
0	he with his thunder and till then who knew
0	the force of those dire arms yet not for those 
0	nor what the potent victor in his rage
0	can else inflict do i repent or change 
0	though changed in outward lustre that fixed mind 
0	and high disdain from sense of injured merit 
0	that with the mightiest raised me to contend 
0	and to the fierce contentions brought along
0	innumerable force of spirits armed 
0	that durst dislike his reign and me preferring 
0	his utmost power with adverse power opposed
0	in dubious battle on the plains of heaven 
0	and shook his throne what though the field be lost 
0	all is not lost the unconquerable will 
0	and study of revenge immortal hate 
0	and courage never to submit or yield 
0	and what is else not to be overcome 
0	that glory never shall his wrath or might
0	extort from me to bow and sue for grace
0	with suppliant knee and deify his power
0	who from the terror of this arm so late
0	doubted his empire that were low indeed 
0	that were an ignominy and shame beneath
0	this downfall since by fate the strength of gods 
0	and this empyreal sybstance cannot fail 
0	since through experience of this great event 
0	in arms not worse in foresight much advanced 
0	we may with more successful hope resolve
0	to wage by force or guile eternal war 
0	irreconcilable to our grand foe 
0	who now triumphs and in th excess of joy
0	sole reigning holds the tyranny of heaven 
0	so spake th apostate angel though in pain 
0	vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair 
0	and him thus answered soon his bold compeer 
0	 o prince o chief of many throned powers
0	that led th embattled seraphim to war
0	under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds
0	fearless endangered heaven s perpetual king 
0	and put to proof his high supremacy 
0	whether upheld by strength or chance or fate 
0	too well i see and rue the dire event
0	that with sad overthrow and foul defeat 
0	hath lost us heaven and all this mighty host
0	in horrible destruction laid thus low 
0	as far as gods and heavenly essences
0	can perish for the mind and spirit remains
0	invincible and vigour soon returns 
0	though all our glory extinct and happy state
0	here swallowed up in endless misery 
0	but what if he our conqueror whom i now
0	of force believe almighty since no less
0	than such could have o erpowered such force as ours 
0	have left us this our spirit and strength entire 
0	strongly to suffer and support our pains 
0	that we may so suffice his vengeful ire 
0	or do him mightier service as his thralls
0	by right of war whate er his business be 
0	here in the heart of hell to work in fire 
0	or do his errands in the gloomy deep 
0	what can it the avail though yet we feel
0	strength undiminished or eternal being
0	to undergo eternal punishment 
0	whereto with speedy words th arch fiend replied 
0	 fallen cherub to be weak is miserable 
0	doing or suffering but of this be sure 
0	to do aught good never will be our task 
0	but ever to do ill our sole delight 
0	as being the contrary to his high will
0	whom we resist if then his providence
0	out of our evil seek to bring forth good 
0	our labour must be to pervert that end 
0	and out of good still to find means of evil 
0	which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps
0	shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb
0	his inmost counsels from their destined aim 
0	but see the angry victor hath recalled
0	his ministers of vengeance and pursuit
0	back to the gates of heaven the sulphurous hail 
0	shot after us in storm o erblown hath laid
0	the fiery surge that from the precipice
0	of heaven received us falling and the thunder 
0	winged with red lightning and impetuous rage 
0	perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now
0	to bellow through the vast and boundless deep 
0	let us not slip th occasion whether scorn
0	or satiate fury yield it from our foe 
0	seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild 
0	the seat of desolation void of light 
0	save what the glimmering of these livid flames
0	casts pale and dreadful thither let us tend
0	from off the tossing of these fiery waves 
0	there rest if any rest can harbour there 
0	and re assembling our afflicted powers 
0	consult how we may henceforth most offend
0	our enemy our own loss how repair 
0	how overcome this dire calamity 
0	what reinforcement we may gain from hope 
0	if not what resolution from despair 
0	thus satan talking to his nearest mate 
0	with head uplift above the wave and eyes
0	that sparkling blazed his other parts besides
0	prone on the flood extended long and large 
0	lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge
0	as whom the fables name of monstrous size 
0	titanian or earth born that warred on jove 
0	briareos or typhon whom the den
0	by ancient tarsus held or that sea beast
0	leviathan which god of all his works
0	created hugest that swim th ocean stream 
0	him haply slumbering on the norway foam 
0	the pilot of some small night foundered skiff 
0	deeming some island oft as seamen tell 
0	with fixed anchor in his scaly rind 
0	moors by his side under the lee while night
0	invests the sea and wished morn delays 
0	so stretched out huge in length the arch fiend lay 
0	chained on the burning lake nor ever thence
0	had risen or heaved his head but that the will
0	and high permission of all ruling heaven
0	left him at large to his own dark designs 
0	that with reiterated crimes he might
0	heap on himself damnation while he sought
0	evil to others and enraged might see
0	how all his malice served but to bring forth
0	infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn
0	on man by him seduced but on himself
0	treble confusion wrath and vengeance poured 
0	forthwith upright he rears from off the pool
0	his mighty stature on each hand the flames
0	driven backward slope their pointing spires and rolled
0	in billows leave i th midst a horrid vale 
0	then with expanded wings he steers his flight
0	aloft incumbent on the dusky air 
0	that felt unusual weight till on dry land
0	he lights if it were land that ever burned
0	with solid as the lake with liquid fire 
0	and such appeared in hue as when the force
0	of subterranean wind transports a hill
0	torn from pelorus or the shattered side
0	of thundering etna whose combustible
0	and fuelled entrails thence conceiving fire 
0	sublimed with mineral fury aid the winds 
0	and leave a singed bottom all involved
0	with stench and smoke such resting found the sole
0	of unblest feet him followed his next mate 
0	both glorying to have scaped the stygian flood
0	as gods and by their own recovered strength 
0	not by the sufferance of supernal power 
0	 is this the region this the soil the clime 
0	said then the lost archangel this the seat
0	that we must change for heaven this mournful gloom
0	for that celestial light be it so since he
0	who now is sovereign can dispose and bid
0	what shall be right farthest from him is best
0	whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme
0	above his equals farewell happy fields 
0	where joy for ever dwells hail horrors hail 
0	infernal world and thou profoundest hell 
0	receive thy new possessor one who brings
0	a mind not to be changed by place or time 
0	the mind is its own place and in itself
0	can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven 
0	what matter where if i be still the same 
0	and what i should be all but less than he
0	whom thunder hath made greater here at least
0	we shall be free th almighty hath not built
0	here for his envy will not drive us hence 
0	here we may reign secure and in my choice 
0	to reign is worth ambition though in hell 
0	better to reign in hell than serve in heaven 
0	but wherefore let we then our faithful friends 
0	th associates and co partners of our loss 
0	lie thus astonished on th oblivious pool 
0	and call them not to share with us their part
0	in this unhappy mansion or once more
0	with rallied arms to try what may be yet
0	regained in heaven or what more lost in hell 
0	so satan spake and him beelzebub
0	thus answered leader of those armies bright
0	which but th omnipotent none could have foiled 
0	if once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge
0	of hope in fears and dangers heard so oft
0	in worst extremes and on the perilous edge
0	of battle when it raged in all assaults
0	their surest signal they will soon resume
0	new courage and revive though now they lie
0	grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire 
0	as we erewhile astounded and amazed 
0	no wonder fallen such a pernicious height 
0	he scare had ceased when the superior fiend
0	was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield 
0	ethereal temper massy large and round 
0	behind him cast the broad circumference
0	hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb
0	through optic glass the tuscan artist views
0	at evening from the top of fesole 
0	or in valdarno to descry new lands 
0	rivers or mountains in her spotty globe 
0	his spear to equal which the tallest pine
0	hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast
0	of some great ammiral were but a wand 
0	he walked with to support uneasy steps
0	over the burning marl not like those steps
0	on heaven s azure and the torrid clime
0	smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire 
0	nathless he so endured till on the beach
0	of that inflamed sea he stood and called
0	his legions angel forms who lay entranced
0	thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
0	in vallombrosa where th etrurian shades
0	high over arched embower or scattered sedge
0	afloat when with fierce winds orion armed
0	hath vexed the red sea coast whose waves o erthrew
0	busiris and his memphian chivalry 
0	while with perfidious hatred they pursued
0	the sojourners of goshen who beheld
0	from the safe shore their floating carcases
0	and broken chariot wheels so thick bestrown 
0	abject and lost lay these covering the flood 
0	under amazement of their hideous change 
0	he called so loud that all the hollow deep
0	of hell resounded princes potentates 
0	warriors the flower of heaven once yours now lost 
0	if such astonishment as this can seize
0	eternal spirits or have ye chosen this place
0	after the toil of battle to repose
0	your wearied virtue for the ease you find
0	to slumber here as in the vales of heaven 
0	or in this abject posture have ye sworn
0	to adore the conqueror who now beholds
0	cherub and seraph rolling in the flood
0	with scattered arms and ensigns till anon
0	his swift pursuers from heaven gates discern
0	th advantage and descending tread us down
0	thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts
0	transfix us to the bottom of this gulf 
0	awake arise or be for ever fallen 
0	they heard and were abashed and up they sprung
0	upon the wing as when men wont to watch
0	on duty sleeping found by whom they dread 
0	rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake 
0	nor did they not perceive the evil plight
0	in which they were or the fierce pains not feel 
0	yet to their general s voice they soon obeyed
0	innumerable as when the potent rod
0	waved round the coast up called a pitchy cloud
0	of locusts warping on the eastern wind 
0	that o er the realm of impious pharaoh hung
0	like night and darkened all the land of nile 
0	so numberless were those bad angels seen
0	hovering on wing under the cope of hell 
0	 twixt upper nether and surrounding fires 
0	till as a signal given th uplifted spear
0	of their great sultan waving to direct
0	their course in even balance down they light
0	on the firm brimstone and fill all the plain 
0	a multitude like which the populous north
0	poured never from her frozen loins to pass
0	rhene or the danaw when her barbarous sons
0	came like a deluge on the south and spread
0	beneath gibraltar to the libyan sands 
0	forthwith form every squadron and each band 
0	the heads and leaders thither haste where stood
0	their great commander godlike shapes and forms
0	excelling human princely dignities 
0	and powers that erst in heaven sat on thrones 
0	though on their names in heavenly records now
0	be no memorial blotted out and rased
0	by their rebellion from the books of life 
0	nor had they yet among the sons of eve
0	got them new names till wandering o er the earth 
0	through god s high sufferance for the trial of man 
0	by falsities and lies the greatest part
0	of mankind they corrupted to forsake
0	god their creator and th invisible
0	glory of him that made them to transform
0	oft to the image of a brute adorned
0	with gay religions full of pomp and gold 
0	and devils to adore for deities 
0	then were they known to men by various names 
0	and various idols through the heathen world

0	roused from the slumber on that fiery couch 
0	at their great emperor s call as next in worth
0	came singly where he stood on the bare strand 
0	while the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof 
0	the chief were those who from the pit of hell
0	roaming to seek their prey on earth durst fix
0	their seats long after next the seat of god 
0	their altars by his altar gods adored
0	among the nations round and durst abide
0	jehovah thundering out of sion throned
0	between the cherubim yea often placed
0	within his sanctuary itself their shrines 
0	abominations and with cursed things
0	his holy rites and solemn feasts profaned 
0	and with their darkness durst affront his light 
0	first moloch horrid king besmeared with blood
0	of human sacrifice and parents tears 
0	though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud 
0	their children s cries unheard that passed through fire
0	to his grim idol him the ammonite
0	worshiped in rabba and her watery plain 
0	in argob and in basan to the stream
0	of utmost arnon nor content with such
0	audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart
0	of solomon he led by fraud to build
0	his temple right against the temple of god
0	on that opprobrious hill and made his grove
0	the pleasant valley of hinnom tophet thence
0	and black gehenna called the type of hell 
0	next chemos th obscene dread of moab s sons 
0	from aroar to nebo and the wild
0	of southmost abarim in hesebon
0	and horonaim seon s real beyond
0	the flowery dale of sibma clad with vines 
0	peor his other name when he enticed
0	israel in sittim on their march from nile 
0	to do him wanton rites which cost them woe 
0	yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged
0	even to that hill of scandal by the grove
0	of moloch homicide lust hard by hate 
0	till good josiah drove them thence to hell 
0	with these came they who from the bordering flood
0	of old euphrates to the brook that parts
0	of baalim and ashtaroth those male 
0	these feminine for spirits when they please 
0	can either sex assume or both so soft
0	and uncompounded is their essence pure 
0	not tried or manacled with joint or limb 
0	nor founded on the brittle strength of bones 
0	like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose 
0	dilated or condensed bright or obscure 
0	can execute their airy purposes 
0	and works of love or enmity fulfil 
0	for those the race of israel oft forsook
0	their living strength and unfrequented left
0	his righteous altar bowing lowly down
0	to bestial gods for which their heads as low
0	bowed down in battle sunk before the spear
0	of despicable foes with these in troop
0	came astoreth whom the phoenicians called
0	astarte queen of heaven with crescent horns 
0	to whose bright image nightly by the moon
0	sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs 
0	in sion also not unsung where stood
0	her temple on th offensive mountain built
0	by that uxorious king whose heart though large 
0	beguiled by fair idolatresses fell
0	to idols foul thammuz came next behind 
0	whose annual wound in lebanon allured
0	the syrian damsels to lament his fate
0	in amorous ditties all a summer s day 
0	while smooth adonis from his native rock
0	ran purple to the sea supposed with blood
0	of thammuz yearly wounded the love tale
0	infected sion s daughters with like heat 
0	whose wanton passions in the sacred porch
0	ezekiel saw when by the vision led 
0	his eye surveyed the dark idolatries
0	of alienated judah next came one
0	who mourned in earnest when the captive ark
0	maimed his brute image head and hands lopt off 
0	in his own temple on the grunsel edge 
0	where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers 
0	and downward fish yet had his temple high
0	reared in azotus dreaded through the coast
0	and accaron and gaza s frontier bounds 
0	him followed rimmon whose delightful seat
0	was fair damascus on the fertile banks
0	of abbana and pharphar lucid streams 
0	he also against the house of god was bold 
0	a leper once he lost and gained a king 
0	ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew
0	god s altar to disparage and displace
0	for one of syrian mode whereon to burn
0	his odious offerings and adore the gods
0	whom he had vanquished after these appeared
0	a crew who under names of old renown 
0	osiris isis orus and their train 
0	with monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
0	their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
0	rather than human nor did israel scape
0	th infection when their borrowed gold composed
0	the calf in oreb and the rebel king
0	doubled that sin in bethel and in dan 
0	likening his maker to the grazed ox 
0	jehovah who in one night when he passed
0	both her first born and all her bleating gods 
0	belial came last than whom a spirit more lewd
0	fell not from heaven or more gross to love
0	vice for itself to him no temple stood
0	or altar smoked yet who more oft than he
0	in temples and at altars when the priest
0	turns atheist as did eli s sons who filled
0	with lust and violence the house of god 
0	in courts and palaces he also reigns 
0	and in luxurious cities where the noise
0	of riot ascends above their loftiest towers 
0	and injury and outrage and when night
0	darkens the streets then wander forth the sons
0	of belial flown with insolence and wine 
0	witness the streets of sodom and that night
0	in gibeah when the hospitable door
0	exposed a matron to avoid worse rape 
0	these were the prime in order and in might 
0	the rest were long to tell though far renowned
0	th ionian gods of javan s issue held
0	gods yet confessed later than heaven and earth 
0	their boasted parents titan heaven s first born 
0	with his enormous brood and birthright seized
0	by younger saturn he from mightier jove 
0	his own and rhea s son like measure found 
0	so jove usurping reigned these first in crete
0	and ida known thence on the snowy top
0	of cold olympus ruled the middle air 
0	their highest heaven or on the delphian cliff 
0	or in dodona and through all the bounds
0	of doric land or who with saturn old
0	fled over adria to th hesperian fields 
0	and o er the celtic roamed the utmost isles 
0	all these and more came flocking but with looks
0	downcast and damp yet such wherein appeared
0	obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their chief
0	not in despair to have found themselves not lost
0	in loss itself which on his countenance cast
0	like doubtful hue but he his wonted pride
0	soon recollecting with high words that bore
0	semblance of worth not substance gently raised
0	their fainting courage and dispelled their fears 
0	then straight commands that at the warlike sound
0	of trumpets loud and clarions be upreared
0	his mighty standard that proud honour claimed
0	azazel as his right a cherub tall 
0	who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled
0	th imperial ensign which full high advanced 
0	shone like a meteor streaming to the wind 
0	with gems and golden lustre rich emblazed 
0	seraphic arms and trophies all the while
0	sonorous metal blowing martial sounds 
0	at which the universal host up sent
0	a shout that tore hell s concave and beyond
0	frighted the reign of chaos and old night 
0	all in a moment through the gloom were seen
0	ten thousand banners rise into the air 
0	with orient colours waving with them rose
0	a forest huge of spears and thronging helms
0	appeared and serried shields in thick array
0	of depth immeasurable anon they move
0	in perfect phalanx to the dorian mood
0	of flutes and soft recorders such as raised
0	to height of noblest temper heroes old
0	arming to battle and instead of rage
0	deliberate valour breathed firm and unmoved
0	with dread of death to flight or foul retreat 
0	nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
0	with solemn touches troubled thoughts and chase
0	anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
0	from mortal or immortal minds thus they 
0	breathing united force with fixed thought 
0	moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed
0	their painful steps o er the burnt soil and now
0	advanced in view they stand a horrid front
0	of dreadful length and dazzling arms in guise
0	of warriors old with ordered spear and shield 
0	awaiting what command their mighty chief
0	had to impose he through the armed files
0	darts his experienced eye and soon traverse
0	the whole battalion views their order due 
0	their visages and stature as of gods 
0	their number last he sums and now his heart
0	distends with pride and hardening in his strength 
0	glories for never since created man 
0	met such embodied force as named with these 
0	could merit more than that small infantry
0	warred on by cranes though all the giant brood
0	of phlegra with th heroic race were joined
0	that fought at thebes and ilium on each side
0	mixed with auxiliar gods and what resounds
0	in fable or romance of uther s son 
0	begirt with british and armoric knights 
0	and all who since baptized or infidel 
0	or whom biserta sent from afric shore
0	when charlemain with all his peerage fell
0	by fontarabbia thus far these beyond
0	compare of mortal prowess yet observed
0	their dread commander he above the rest
0	in shape and gesture proudly eminent 
0	stood like a tower his form had yet not lost
0	all her original brightness nor appeared
0	less than archangel ruined and th excess
0	of glory obscured as when the sun new risen
0	looks through the horizontal misty air
0	shorn of his beams or from behind the moon 
0	in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds
0	on half the nations and with fear of change
0	perplexes monarchs darkened so yet shone
0	above them all th archangel but his face
0	deep scars of thunder had intrenched and care
0	sat on his faded cheek but under brows
0	of dauntless courage and considerate pride
0	waiting revenge cruel his eye but cast
0	signs of remorse and passion to behold
0	the fellows of his crime the followers rather
0	 far other once beheld in bliss condemned
0	for ever now to have their lot in pain 
0	millions of spirits for his fault amerced
0	of heaven and from eternal splendours flung
0	for his revolt yet faithful how they stood 
0	their glory withered as when heaven s fire
0	hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines 
0	with singed top their stately growth though bare 
0	stands on the blasted heath he now prepared
0	to speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend
0	from wing to wing and half enclose him round
0	with all his peers attention held them mute 
0	thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn 
0	tears such as angels weep burst forth at last
0	words interwove with sighs found out their way 
0	 o myriads of immortal spirits o powers
0	matchless but with th almighty and that strife
0	was not inglorious though th event was dire 
0	as this place testifies and this dire change 
0	hateful to utter but what power of mind 
0	forseeing or presaging from the depth
0	of knowledge past or present could have feared
0	how such united force of gods how such
0	as stood like these could ever know repulse 
0	for who can yet believe though after loss 
0	that all these puissant legions whose exile
0	hath emptied heaven shall fail to re ascend 
0	self raised and repossess their native seat 
0	for me be witness all the host of heaven 
0	if counsels different or danger shunned
0	by me have lost our hopes but he who reigns
0	monarch in heaven till then as one secure
0	sat on his throne upheld by old repute 
0	consent or custom and his regal state
0	put forth at full but still his strength concealed 
0	which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall 
0	henceforth his might we know and know our own 
0	so as not either to provoke or dread
0	new war provoked our better part remains
0	to work in close design by fraud or guile 
0	what force effected not that he no less
0	at length from us may find who overcomes
0	by force hath overcome but half his foe 
0	space may produce new worlds whereof so rife
0	there went a fame in heaven that he ere long
0	intended to create and therein plant
0	a generation whom his choice regard
0	should favour equal to the sons of heaven 
0	thither if but to pry shall be perhaps
0	our first eruption thither or elsewhere 
0	for this infernal pit shall never hold
0	celestial spirits in bondage nor th abyss
0	long under darkness cover but these thoughts
0	full counsel must mature peace is despaired 
0	for who can think submission war then war
0	open or understood must be resolved 
0	he spake and to confirm his words outflew
0	millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs
0	of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze
0	far round illumined hell highly they raged
0	against the highest and fierce with grasped arms
0	clashed on their sounding shields the din of war 
0	hurling defiance toward the vault of heaven 
0	there stood a hill not far whose grisly top
0	belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire
0	shone with a glossy scurf undoubted sign
0	that in his womb was hid metallic ore 
0	the work of sulphur thither winged with speed 
0	a numerous brigade hastened as when bands
0	forerun the royal camp to trench a field 
0	or cast a rampart mammon led them on 
0	mammon the least erected spirit that fell
0	from heaven for even in heaven his looks and thoughts
0	were always downward bent admiring more
0	the riches of heaven s pavement trodden gold 
0	than aught divine or holy else enjoyed
0	in vision beatific by him first
0	men also and by his suggestion taught 
0	ransacked the centre and with impious hands
0	rifled the bowels of their mother earth
0	for treasures better hid soon had his crew
0	opened into the hill a spacious wound 
0	and digged out ribs of gold let none admire
0	that riches grow in hell that soil may best
0	deserve the precious bane and here let those
0	who boast in mortal things and wondering tell
0	of babel and the works of memphian kings 
0	learn how their greatest monuments of fame
0	and strength and art are easily outdone
0	by spirits reprobate and in an hour
0	what in an age they with incessant toil
0	and hands innumerable scarce perform 
0	nigh on the plain in many cells prepared 
0	that underneath had veins of liquid fire
0	sluiced from the lake a second multitude
0	with wondrous art founded the massy ore 
0	severing each kind and scummed the bullion dross 
0	a third as soon had formed within the ground
0	a various mould and from the boiling cells
0	by strange conveyance filled each hollow nook 
0	as in an organ from one blast of wind 
0	to many a row of pipes the sound board breathes 
0	anon out of the earth a fabric huge
0	rose like an exhalation with the sound
0	of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet 
0	built like a temple where pilasters round
0	were set and doric pillars overlaid
0	with golden architrave nor did there want
0	cornice or frieze with bossy sculptures graven 
0	the roof was fretted gold not babylon
0	nor great alcairo such magnificence
0	equalled in all their glories to enshrine
0	belus or serapis their gods or seat
0	in wealth and luxury th ascending pile
0	stood fixed her stately height and straight the doors 
0	opening their brazen folds discover wide
0	within her ample spaces o er the smooth
0	and level pavement from the arched roof 
0	pendent by subtle magic many a row
0	of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed
0	with naptha and asphaltus yielded light
0	as from a sky the hasty multitude
0	admiring entered and the work some praise 
0	and some the architect his hand was known
0	in heaven by many a towered structure high 
0	where sceptred angels held their residence 
0	and sat as princes whom the supreme king
0	exalted to such power and gave to rule 
0	each in his hierarchy the orders bright 
0	nor was his name unheard or unadored
0	in ancient greece and in ausonian land
0	men called him mulciber and how he fell
0	from heaven they fabled thrown by angry jove
0	sheer o er the crystal battlements from morn
0	to noon he fell from noon to dewy eve 
0	a summer s day and with the setting sun
0	dropt from the zenith like a falling star 
0	on lemnos th aegaean isle thus they relate 
0	erring for he with this rebellious rout
0	fell long before nor aught availed him now
0	to have built in heaven high towers nor did he scape
0	by all his engines but was headlong sent 
0	with his industrious crew to build in hell 
0	meanwhile the winged heralds by command
0	of sovereign power with awful ceremony
0	and trumpet s sound throughout the host proclaim
0	a solemn council forthwith to be held
0	at pandemonium the high capital
0	of satan and his peers their summons called
0	from every band and squared regiment
0	by place or choice the worthiest they anon
0	with hundreds and with thousands trooping came
0	attended all access was thronged the gates
0	and porches wide but chief the spacious hall
0	 though like a covered field where champions bold
0	wont ride in armed and at the soldan s chair
0	defied the best of paynim chivalry
0	to mortal combat or career with lance 
0	thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air 
0	brushed with the hiss of rustling wings as bees
0	in spring time when the sun with taurus rides 
0	pour forth their populous youth about the hive
0	in clusters they among fresh dews and flowers
0	fly to and fro or on the smoothed plank 
0	the suburb of their straw built citadel 
0	new rubbed with balm expatiate and confer
0	their state affairs so thick the airy crowd
0	swarmed and were straitened till the signal given 
0	behold a wonder they but now who seemed
0	in bigness to surpass earth s giant sons 
0	now less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room
0	throng numberless like that pygmean race
0	beyond the indian mount or faery elves 
0	whose midnight revels by a forest side
0	or fountain some belated peasant sees 
0	or dreams he sees while overhead the moon
0	sits arbitress and nearer to the earth
0	wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance
0	intent with jocund music charm his ear 
0	at once with joy and fear his heart rebounds 
0	thus incorporeal spirits to smallest forms
0	reduced their shapes immense and were at large 
0	though without number still amidst the hall
0	of that infernal court but far within 
0	and in their own dimensions like themselves 
0	the great seraphic lords and cherubim
0	in close recess and secret conclave sat 
0	a thousand demi gods on golden seats 
0	frequent and full after short silence then 
0	and summons read the great consult began 
0	high on a throne of royal state which far
0	outshone the wealth or ormus and of ind 
0	or where the gorgeous east with richest hand
0	showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold 
0	satan exalted sat by merit raised
0	to that bad eminence and from despair
0	thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires
0	beyond thus high insatiate to pursue
0	vain war with heaven and by success untaught 
0	his proud imaginations thus displayed 
0	for since no deep within her gulf can hold
0	immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen 
0	i give not heaven for lost from this descent
0	celestial virtues rising will appear
0	more glorious and more dread than from no fall 
0	and trust themselves to fear no second fate 
0	me though just right and the fixed laws of heaven 
0	did first create your leader next free choice
0	with what besides in council or in fight
0	hath been achieved of merit yet this loss 
0	thus far at least recovered hath much more
0	established in a safe unenvied throne 
0	yielded with full consent the happier state
0	in heaven which follows dignity might draw
0	envy from each inferior but who here
0	will envy whom the highest place exposes
0	foremost to stand against the thunderer s aim
0	your bulwark and condemns to greatest share
0	of endless pain where there is then no good
0	for which to strive no strife can grow up there
0	from faction for none sure will claim in hell
0	precedence none whose portion is so small
0	of present pain that with ambitious mind
0	will covet more with this advantage then 
0	to union and firm faith and firm accord 
0	more than can be in heaven we now return
0	to claim our just inheritance of old 
0	surer to prosper than prosperity
0	could have assured us and by what best way 
0	whether of open war or covert guile 
0	we now debate who can advise may speak 
0	he ceased and next him moloch sceptred king 
0	stood up the strongest and the fiercest spirit
0	that fought in heaven now fiercer by despair 
0	his trust was with th eternal to be deemed
0	equal in strength and rather than be less
0	cared not to be at all with that care lost
0	went all his fear of god or hell or worse 
0	he recked not and these words thereafter spake 
0	 my sentence is for open war of wiles 
0	more unexpert i boast not them let those
0	contrive who need or when they need not now 
0	for while they sit contriving shall the rest 
0	millions that stand in arms and longing wait
0	the signal to ascend sit lingering here 
0	heaven s fugitives and for their dwelling place
0	accept this dark opprobrious den of shame 
0	the prison of his tyranny who reigns
0	by our delay no let us rather choose 
0	armed with hell flames and fury all at once
0	o er heaven s high towers to force resistless way 
0	turning our tortures into horrid arms
0	against the torturer when to meet the noise
0	of his almighty engine he shall hear
0	infernal thunder and for lightning see
0	black fire and horror shot with equal rage
0	among his angels and his throne itself
0	mixed with tartarean sulphur and strange fire 
0	his own invented torments but perhaps
0	the way seems difficult and steep to scale
0	with upright wing against a higher foe 
0	let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
0	of that forgetful lake benumb not still 
0	that in our proper motion we ascend
0	up to our native seat descent and fall
0	to us is adverse who but felt of late 
0	when the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
0	insulting and pursued us through the deep 
0	with what compulsion and laborious flight
0	we sunk thus low th ascent is easy then 
0	th event is feared should we again provoke
0	our stronger some worse way his wrath may find
0	to our destruction if there be in hell
0	fear to be worse destroyed what can be worse
0	than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned
0	in this abhorred deep to utter woe 
0	where pain of unextinguishable fire
0	must exercise us without hope of end
0	the vassals of his anger when the scourge
0	inexorably and the torturing hour 
0	calls us to penance more destroyed than thus 
0	we should be quite abolished and expire 
0	what fear we then what doubt we to incense
0	his utmost ire which to the height enraged 
0	will either quite consume us and reduce
0	to nothing this essential happier far
0	than miserable to have eternal being 
0	or if our substance be indeed divine 
0	and cannot cease to be we are at worst
0	on this side nothing and by proof we feel
0	our power sufficient to disturb his heaven 
0	and with perpetual inroads to alarm 
0	though inaccessible his fatal throne 
0	which if not victory is yet revenge 
0	he ended frowning and his look denounced
0	desperate revenge and battle dangerous
0	to less than gods on th other side up rose
0	belial in act more graceful and humane 
0	a fairer person lost not heaven he seemed
0	for dignity composed and high exploit 
0	but all was false and hollow though his tongue
0	dropped manna and could make the worse appear
0	the better reason to perplex and dash
0	maturest counsels for his thoughts were low 
0	to vice industrious but to nobler deeds
0	timorous and slothful yet he pleased the ear 
0	and with persuasive accent thus began 
0	 i should be much for open war o peers 
0	as not behind in hate if what was urged
0	main reason to persuade immediate war
0	did not dissuade me most and seem to cast
0	ominous conjecture on the whole success 
0	when he who most excels in fact of arms 
0	in what he counsels and in what excels
0	mistrustful grounds his courage on despair
0	and utter dissolution as the scope
0	of all his aim after some dire revenge 
0	first what revenge the towers of heaven are filled
0	with armed watch that render all access
0	impregnable oft on the bordering deep
0	encamp their legions or with obscure wing
0	scout far and wide into the realm of night 
0	scorning surprise or could we break our way
0	by force and at our heels all hell should rise
0	with blackest insurrection to confound
0	heaven s purest light yet our great enemy 
0	all incorruptible would on his throne
0	sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould 
0	incapable of stain would soon expel
0	her mischief and purge off the baser fire 
0	victorious thus repulsed our final hope
0	is flat despair we must exasperate
0	th almighty victor to spend all his rage 
0	and that must end us that must be our cure 
0	to be no more sad cure for who would lose 
0	though full of pain this intellectual being 
0	those thoughts that wander through eternity 
0	to perish rather swallowed up and lost
0	in the wide womb of uncreated night 
0	devoid of sense and motion and who knows 
0	let this be good whether our angry foe
0	can give it or will ever how he can
0	is doubtful that he never will is sure 
0	will he so wise let loose at once his ire 
0	belike through impotence or unaware 
0	to give his enemies their wish and end
0	them in his anger whom his anger saves
0	to punish endless wherefore cease we then 
0	say they who counsel war we are decreed 
0	reserved and destined to eternal woe 
0	whatever doing what can we suffer more 
0	what can we suffer worse is this then worst 
0	thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms 
0	what when we fled amain pursued and struck
0	with heaven s afflicting thunder and besought
0	the deep to shelter us this hell then seemed
0	a refuge from those wounds or when we lay
0	chained on the burning lake that sure was worse 
0	what if the breath that kindled those grim fires 
0	awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage 
0	and plunge us in the flames or from above
0	should intermitted vengeance arm again
0	his red right hand to plague us what if all
0	her stores were opened and this firmament
0	of hell should spout her cataracts of fire 
0	impendent horrors threatening hideous fall
0	one day upon our heads while we perhaps 
0	designing or exhorting glorious war 
0	caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled 
0	each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey
0	or racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk
0	under yon boiling ocean wrapt in chains 
0	there to converse with everlasting groans 
0	unrespited unpitied unreprieved 
0	ages of hopeless end this would be worse 
0	war therefore open or concealed alike
0	my voice dissuades for what can force or guile
0	with him or who deceive his mind whose eye
0	views all things at one view he from heaven s height
0	all these our motions vain sees and derides 
0	not more almighty to resist our might
0	than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles 
0	shall we then live thus vile the race of heaven
0	thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here
0	chains and these torments better these than worse 
0	by my advice since fate inevitable
0	subdues us and omnipotent decree 
0	the victor s will to suffer as to do 
0	our strength is equal nor the law unjust
0	that so ordains this was at first resolved 
0	if we were wise against so great a foe
0	contending and so doubtful what might fall 
0	i laugh when those who at the spear are bold
0	and venturous if that fail them shrink and fear
0	what yet they know must follow to endure
0	exile or igominy or bonds or pain 
0	the sentence of their conqueror this is now
0	our doom which if we can sustain and bear 
0	our supreme foe in time may much remit
0	his anger and perhaps thus far removed 
0	not mind us not offending satisfied
0	with what is punished whence these raging fires
0	will slacken if his breath stir not their flames 
0	our purer essence then will overcome
0	their noxious vapour or inured not feel 
0	or changed at length and to the place conformed
0	in temper and in nature will receive
0	familiar the fierce heat and void of pain 
0	this horror will grow mild this darkness light 
0	besides what hope the never ending flight
0	of future days may bring what chance what change
0	worth waiting since our present lot appears
0	for happy though but ill for ill not worst 
0	if we procure not to ourselves more woe 
0	thus belial with words clothed in reason s garb 
0	counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth 
0	not peace and after him thus mammon spake 
0	 either to disenthrone the king of heaven
0	we war if war be best or to regain
0	our own right lost him to unthrone we then
0	may hope when everlasting fate shall yield
0	to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife 
0	the former vain to hope argues as vain
0	the latter for what place can be for us
0	within heaven s bound unless heaven s lord supreme
0	we overpower suppose he should relent
0	and publish grace to all on promise made
0	of new subjection with what eyes could we
0	stand in his presence humble and receive
0	strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne
0	with warbled hymns and to his godhead sing
0	forced hallelujahs while he lordly sits
0	our envied sovereign and his altar breathes
0	ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers 
0	our servile offerings this must be our task
0	in heaven this our delight how wearisome
0	eternity so spent in worship paid
0	to whom we hate let us not then pursue 
0	by force impossible by leave obtained
0	unacceptable though in heaven our state
0	of splendid vassalage but rather seek
0	our own good from ourselves and from our own
0	live to ourselves though in this vast recess 
0	free and to none accountable preferring
0	hard liberty before the easy yoke
0	of servile pomp our greatness will appear
0	then most conspicuous when great things of small 
0	useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse 
0	we can create and in what place soe er
0	thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
0	through labour and endurance this deep world
0	of darkness do we dread how oft amidst
0	thick clouds and dark doth heaven s all ruling sire
0	choose to reside his glory unobscured 
0	and with the majesty of darkness round
0	covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar 
0	mustering their rage and heaven resembles hell 
0	as he our darkness cannot we his light
0	imitate when we please this desert soil
0	wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold 
0	nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
0	magnificence and what can heaven show more 
0	our torments also may in length of time 
0	become our elements these piercing fires
0	as soft as now severe our temper changed
0	into their temper which must needs remove
0	the sensible of pain all things invite
0	to peaceful counsels and the settled state
0	of order how in safety best we may
0	compose our present evils with regard
0	of what we are and where dismissing quite
0	all thoughts of war ye have what i advise 
0	he scarce had finished when such murmur filled
0	th assembly as when hollow rocks retain
0	the sound of blustering winds which all night long
0	had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull
0	seafaring men o erwatched whose bark by chance
0	or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
0	after the tempest such applause was heard
0	as mammon ended and his sentence pleased 
0	advising peace for such another field
0	they dreaded worse than hell so much the fear
0	of thunder and the sword of michael
0	wrought still within them and no less desire
0	to found this nether empire which might rise 
0	by policy and long process of time 
0	in emulation opposite to heaven 
0	which when beelzebub perceived than whom 
0	satan except none higher sat with grave
0	aspect he rose and in his rising seemed
0	a pillar of state deep on his front engraven
0	deliberation sat and public care 
0	and princely counsel in his face yet shone 
0	majestic though in ruin sage he stood
0	with atlantean shoulders fit to bear
0	the weight of mightiest monarchies his look
0	drew audience and attention still as night
0	or summer s noontide air while thus he spake 
0	ethereal virtues or these titles now
0	must we renounce and changing style be called
0	princes of hell for so the popular vote
0	inclines here to continue and build up here
0	a growing empire doubtless while we dream 
0	and know not that the king of heaven hath doomed
0	this place our dungeon not our safe retreat
0	beyond his potent arm to live exempt
0	from heaven s high jurisdiction in new league
0	banded against his throne but to remain
0	in strictest bondage though thus far removed 
0	under th inevitable curb reserved
0	his captive multitude for he to be sure 
0	in height or depth still first and last will reign
0	sole king and of his kingdom lose no part
0	by our revolt but over hell extend
0	his empire and with iron sceptre rule
0	us here as with his golden those in heaven 
0	what sit we then projecting peace and war 
0	war hath determined us and foiled with loss
0	irreparable terms of peace yet none
0	vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given
0	to us enslaved but custody severe 
0	and stripes and arbitrary punishment
0	inflicted and what peace can we return 
0	but to our power hostility and hate 
0	untamed reluctance and revenge though slow 
0	yet ever plotting how the conqueror least
0	may reap his conquest and may least rejoice
0	in doing what we most in suffering feel 
0	nor will occasion want nor shall we need
0	with dangerous expedition to invade
0	heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege 
0	or ambush from the deep what if we find
0	some easier enterprise there is a place
0	 if ancient and prophetic fame in heaven
0	err not another world the happy seat
0	of some new race called man about this time
0	to be created like to us though less
0	in power and excellence but favoured more
0	of him who rules above so was his will
0	pronounced among the gods and by an oath
0	that shook heaven s whole circumference confirmed 
0	thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn
0	what creatures there inhabit of what mould
0	or substance how endued and what their power
0	and where their weakness how attempted best 
0	by force of subtlety though heaven be shut 
0	and heaven s high arbitrator sit secure
0	in his own strength this place may lie exposed 
0	the utmost border of his kingdom left
0	to their defence who hold it here perhaps 
0	some advantageous act may be achieved
0	by sudden onset either with hell fire
0	to waste his whole creation or possess
0	all as our own and drive as we were driven 
0	the puny habitants or if not drive 
0	seduce them to our party that their god
0	may prove their foe and with repenting hand
0	abolish his own works this would surpass
0	common revenge and interrupt his joy
0	in our confusion and our joy upraise
0	in his disturbance when his darling sons 
0	hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse
0	their frail original and faded bliss 
0	faded so soon advise if this be worth
0	attempting or to sit in darkness here
0	hatching vain empires thus beelzebub
0	pleaded his devilish counsel first devised
0	by satan and in part proposed for whence 
0	but from the author of all ill could spring
0	so deep a malice to confound the race
0	of mankind in one root and earth with hell
0	to mingle and involve done all to spite
0	the great creator but their spite still serves
0	his glory to augment the bold design
0	pleased highly those infernal states and joy
0	sparkled in all their eyes with full assent
0	they vote whereat his speech he thus renews 
0	 well have ye judged well ended long debate 
0	synod of gods and like to what ye are 
0	great things resolved which from the lowest deep
0	will once more lift us up in spite of fate 
0	nearer our ancient seat perhaps in view
0	of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms 
0	and opportune excursion we may chance
0	re enter heaven or else in some mild zone
0	dwell not unvisited of heaven s fair light 
0	secure and at the brightening orient beam
0	purge off this gloom the soft delicious air 
0	to heal the scar of these corrosive fires 
0	shall breathe her balm but first whom shall we send
0	in search of this new world whom shall we find
0	sufficient who shall tempt with wandering feet
0	the dark unbottomed infinite abyss 
0	and through the palpable obscure find out
0	his uncouth way or spread his airy flight 
0	upborne with indefatigable wings
0	over the vast abrupt ere he arrive
0	the happy isle what strength what art can then
0	suffice or what evasion bear him safe 
0	through the strict senteries and stations thick
0	of angels watching round here he had need
0	all circumspection and we now no less
0	choice in our suffrage for on whom we send
0	the weight of all and our last hope relies 
0	this said he sat and expectation held
0	his look suspense awaiting who appeared
0	to second or oppose or undertake
0	the perilous attempt but all sat mute 
0	pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each
0	in other s countenance read his own dismay 
0	astonished none among the choice and prime
0	of those heaven warring champions could be found
0	so hardy as to proffer or accept 
0	alone the dreadful voyage till at last 
0	satan whom now transcendent glory raised
0	above his fellows with monarchal pride
0	conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake 
0	with reason hath deep silence and demur
0	seized us though undismayed long is the way
0	and hard that out of hell leads up to light 
0	our prison strong this huge convex of fire 
0	outrageous to devour immures us round
0	ninefold and gates of burning adamant 
0	barred over us prohibit all egress 
0	these passed if any pass the void profound
0	of unessential night receives him next 
0	wide gaping and with utter loss of being
0	threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf 
0	if thence he scape into whatever world 
0	or unknown region what remains him less
0	than unknown dangers and as hard escape 
0	but i should ill become this throne o peers 
0	and this imperial sovereignty adorned
0	with splendour armed with power if aught proposed
0	and judged of public moment in the shape
0	of difficulty or danger could deter
0	me from attempting wherefore do i assume
0	these royalties and not refuse to reign 
0	refusing to accept as great a share
0	of hazard as of honour due alike
0	to him who reigns and so much to him due
0	of hazard more as he above the rest
0	high honoured sits go therefore mighty powers 
0	terror of heaven though fallen intend at home 
0	while here shall be our home what best may ease
0	the present misery and render hell
0	more tolerable if there be cure or charm
0	to respite or deceive or slack the pain
0	of this ill mansion intermit no watch
0	against a wakeful foe while i abroad
0	through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
0	deliverance for us all this enterprise
0	none shall partake with me thus saying rose
0	the monarch and prevented all reply 
0	prudent lest from his resolution raised 
0	others among the chief might offer now 
0	certain to be refused what erst they feared 
0	and so refused might in opinion stand
0	his rivals winning cheap the high repute
0	which he through hazard huge must earn but they
0	dreaded not more th adventure than his voice
0	forbidding and at once with him they rose 
0	their rising all at once was as the sound
0	of thunder heard remote towards him they bend
0	with awful reverence prone and as a god
0	extol him equal to the highest in heaven 
0	nor failed they to express how much they praised
0	that for the general safety he despised
0	his own for neither do the spirits damned
0	lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast
0	their specious deeds on earth which glory excites 
0	or close ambition varnished o er with zeal 
0	thus they their doubtful consultations dark
0	ended rejoicing in their matchless chief 
0	as when from mountain tops the dusky clouds
0	ascending while the north wind sleeps o erspread
0	heaven s cheerful face the louring element
0	scowls o er the darkened landscape snow or shower 
0	if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet 
0	extend his evening beam the fields revive 
0	the birds their notes renew and bleating herds
0	attest their joy that hill and valley rings 
0	o shame to men devil with devil damned
0	firm concord holds men only disagree
0	of creatures rational though under hope
0	of heavenly grace and god proclaiming peace 
0	yet live in hatred enmity and strife
0	among themselves and levy cruel wars
0	wasting the earth each other to destroy 
0	as if which might induce us to accord 
0	man had not hellish foes enow besides 
0	that day and night for his destruction wait 
0	the stygian council thus dissolved and forth
0	in order came the grand infernal peers 
0	midst came their mighty paramount and seemed
0	alone th antagonist of heaven nor less
0	than hell s dread emperor with pomp supreme 
0	and god like imitated state him round
0	a globe of fiery seraphim enclosed
0	with bright emblazonry and horrent arms 
0	then of their session ended they bid cry
0	with trumpet s regal sound the great result 
0	toward the four winds four speedy cherubim
0	put to their mouths the sounding alchemy 
0	by herald s voice explained the hollow abyss
0	heard far and wide and all the host of hell
0	with deafening shout returned them loud acclaim 
0	thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised
0	by false presumptuous hope the ranged powers
0	disband and wandering each his several way
0	pursues as inclination or sad choice
0	leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find
0	truce to his restless thoughts and entertain
0	the irksome hours till his great chief return 
0	part on the plain or in the air sublime 
0	upon the wing or in swift race contend 
0	as at th olympian games or pythian fields 
0	part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal
0	with rapid wheels or fronted brigades form 
0	as when to warn proud cities war appears
0	waged in the troubled sky and armies rush
0	to battle in the clouds before each van
0	prick forth the airy knights and couch their spears 
0	till thickest legions close with feats of arms
0	from either end of heaven the welkin burns 
0	others with vast typhoean rage more fell 
0	rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air
0	in whirlwind hell scarce holds the wild uproar 
0	as when alcides from oechalia crowned
0	with conquest felt th envenomed robe and tore
0	through pain up by the roots thessalian pines 
0	and lichas from the top of oeta threw
0	into th euboic sea others more mild 
0	retreated in a silent valley sing
0	with notes angelical to many a harp
0	their own heroic deeds and hapless fall
0	by doom of battle and complain that fate
0	free virtue should enthrall to force or chance 
0	their song was partial but the harmony
0	 what could it less when spirits immortal sing 
0	suspended hell and took with ravishment
0	the thronging audience in discourse more sweet
0	 for eloquence the soul song charms the sense 
0	others apart sat on a hill retired 
0	in thoughts more elevate and reasoned high
0	fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute 
0	and found no end in wandering mazes lost 
0	of good and evil much they argued then 
0	of happiness and final misery 
0	passion and apathy and glory and shame 
0	vain wisdom all and false philosophy 
0	yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm
0	pain for a while or anguish and excite
0	fallacious hope or arm th obdured breast
0	with stubborn patience as with triple steel 
0	another part in squadrons and gross bands 
0	on bold adventure to discover wide
0	that dismal world if any clime perhaps
0	might yield them easier habitation bend
0	four ways their flying march along the banks
0	of four infernal rivers that disgorge
0	into the burning lake their baleful streams 
0	abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate 
0	sad acheron of sorrow black and deep 
0	cocytus named of lamentation loud
0	heard on the rueful stream fierce phlegeton 
0	whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage 
0	far off from these a slow and silent stream 
0	lethe the river of oblivion rolls
0	her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks
0	forthwith his former state and being forgets 
0	forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain 
0	beyond this flood a frozen continent
0	lies dark and wild beat with perpetual storms
0	of whirlwind and dire hail which on firm land
0	thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems
0	of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice 
0	a gulf profound as that serbonian bog
0	betwixt damiata and mount casius old 
0	where armies whole have sunk the parching air
0	burns frore and cold performs th effect of fire 
0	thither by harpy footed furies haled 
0	at certain revolutions all the damned
0	are brought and feel by turns the bitter change
0	of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce 
0	from beds of raging fire to starve in ice
0	their soft ethereal warmth and there to pine
0	immovable infixed and frozen round
0	periods of time thence hurried back to fire 
0	they ferry over this lethean sound
0	both to and fro their sorrow to augment 
0	and wish and struggle as they pass to reach
0	the tempting stream with one small drop to lose
0	in sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe 
0	all in one moment and so near the brink 
0	but fate withstands and to oppose th attempt 
0	medusa with gorgonian terror guards
0	the ford and of itself the water flies
0	all taste of living wight as once it fled
0	the lip of tantalus thus roving on
0	in confused march forlorn th adventurous bands 
0	with shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast 
0	viewed first their lamentable lot and found
0	no rest through many a dark and dreary vale
0	they passed and many a region dolorous 
0	o er many a frozen many a fiery alp 
0	rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death 
0	a universe of death which god by curse
0	created evil for evil only good 
0	where all life dies death lives and nature breeds 
0	perverse all monstrous all prodigious things 
0	obominable inutterable and worse
0	than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived 
0	gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire 
0	satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design 
0	puts on swift wings and toward the gates of hell
0	explores his solitary flight sometimes
0	he scours the right hand coast sometimes the left 
0	now shaves with level wing the deep then soars
0	up to the fiery concave towering high 
0	as when far off at sea a fleet descried
0	hangs in the clouds by equinoctial winds
0	close sailing from bengala or the isles
0	of ternate and tidore whence merchants bring
0	their spicy drugs they on the trading flood 
0	through the wide ethiopian to the cape 
0	ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed
0	far off the flying fiend at last appear
0	hell bounds high reaching to the horrid roof 
0	and thrice threefold the gates three folds were brass 
0	three iron three of adamantine rock 
0	impenetrable impaled with circling fire 
0	yet unconsumed before the gates there sat
0	on either side a formidable shape 
0	the one seemed woman to the waist and fair 
0	but ended foul in many a scaly fold 
0	voluminous and vast a serpent armed
0	with mortal sting about her middle round
0	a cry of hell hounds never ceasing barked
0	with wide cerberean mouths full loud and rung
0	a hideous peal yet when they list would creep 
0	if aught disturbed their noise into her womb 
0	and kennel there yet there still barked and howled
0	within unseen far less abhorred than these
0	vexed scylla bathing in the sea that parts
0	calabria from the hoarse trinacrian shore 
0	nor uglier follow the night hag when called
0	in secret riding through the air she comes 
0	lured with the smell of infant blood to dance
0	with lapland witches while the labouring moon
0	eclipses at their charms the other shape 
0	if shape it might be called that shape had none
0	distinguishable in member joint or limb 
0	or substance might be called that shadow seemed 
0	for each seemed either black it stood as night 
0	fierce as ten furies terrible as hell 
0	and shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head
0	the likeness of a kingly crown had on 
0	satan was now at hand and from his seat
0	the monster moving onward came as fast
0	with horrid strides hell trembled as he strode 
0	th undaunted fiend what this might be admired 
0	admired not feared god and his son except 
0	created thing naught valued he nor shunned 
0	and with disdainful look thus first began 
0	 whence and what art thou execrable shape 
0	that dar st though grim and terrible advance
0	thy miscreated front athwart my way
0	to yonder gates through them i mean to pass 
0	that be assured without leave asked of thee 
0	retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof 
0	hell born not to contend with spirits of heaven 
0	to whom the goblin full of wrath replied 
0	 art thou that traitor angel art thou he 
0	who first broke peace in heaven and faith till then
0	unbroken and in proud rebellious arms
0	drew after him the third part of heaven s sons 
0	conjured against the highest for which both thou
0	and they outcast from god are here condemned
0	to waste eternal days in woe and pain 
0	and reckon st thou thyself with spirits of heaven
0	hell doomed and breath st defiance here and scorn 
0	where i reign king and to enrage thee more 
0	thy king and lord back to thy punishment 
0	false fugitive and to thy speed add wings 
0	lest with a whip of scorpions i pursue
0	thy lingering or with one stroke of this dart
0	strange horror seize thee and pangs unfelt before 
0	so spake the grisly terror and in shape 
0	so speaking and so threatening grew tenfold 
0	more dreadful and deform on th other side 
0	incensed with indignation satan stood
0	unterrified and like a comet burned 
0	that fires the length of ophiuchus huge
0	in th arctic sky and from his horrid hair
0	shakes pestilence and war each at the head
0	levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands
0	no second stroke intend and such a frown
0	each cast at th other as when two black clouds 
0	with heaven s artillery fraught came rattling on
0	over the caspian then stand front to front
0	hovering a space till winds the signal blow
0	to join their dark encounter in mid air 
0	so frowned the mighty combatants that hell
0	grew darker at their frown so matched they stood 
0	for never but once more was wither like
0	to meet so great a foe and now great deeds

0	 o father what intends thy hand she cried 
0	 against thy only son what fury o son 
0	possesses thee to bend that mortal dart

0	 so strange thy outcry and thy words so strange
0	thou interposest that my sudden hand 
0	prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
0	what it intends till first i know of thee
0	what thing thou art thus double formed and why 
0	in this infernal vale first met thou call st

0	i know thee not nor ever saw till now
0	sight more detestable than him and thee 
0	t whom thus the portress of hell gate replied 
0	 hast thou forgot me then and do i seem
0	now in thine eye so foul once deemed so fair
0	in heaven when at th assembly and in sight
0	of all the seraphim with thee combined
0	in bold conspiracy against heaven s king 
0	all on a sudden miserable pain
0	surprised thee dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
0	in darkness while thy head flames thick and fast

0	likest to thee in shape and countenance bright 
0	then shining heavenly fair a goddess armed

0	all th host of heaven back they recoiled afraid
0	at first and called me sin and for a sign

0	and fields were fought in heaven wherein remained
0	 for what could else to our almighty foe
0	clear victory to our part loss and rout
0	through all the empyrean down they fell 
0	driven headlong from the pitch of heaven down
0	into this deep and in the general fall
0	i also at which time this powerful key
0	into my hands was given with charge to keep
0	these gates for ever shut which none can pass
0	without my opening pensive here i sat
0	alone but long i sat not till my womb 
0	pregnant by thee and now excessive grown 
0	prodigious motion felt and rueful throes 
0	at last this odious offspring whom thou seest 
0	thine own begotten breaking violent way 
0	tore through my entrails that with fear and pain
0	distorted all my nether shape thus grew
0	transformed but he my inbred enemy
0	forth issued brandishing his fatal dart 
0	made to destroy i fled and cried out death 
0	hell trembled at the hideous name and sighed
0	from all her caves and back resounded death 
0	i fled but he pursued though more it seems 
0	inflamed with lust than rage and swifter far 
0	me overtook his mother all dismayed 
0	and in embraces forcible and foul
0	engendering with me of that rape begot
0	these yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry
0	surround me as thou saw st hourly conceived
0	and hourly born with sorrow infinite
0	to me for when they list into the womb
0	that bred them they return and howl and gnaw
0	my bowels their repast then bursting forth

0	that rest or intermission none i find 
0	before mine eyes in opposition sits
0	grim death my son and foe who set them on 
0	and me his parent would full soon devour
0	for want of other prey but that he knows
0	his end with mine involved and knows that i
0	should prove a bitter morsel and his bane 
0	whenever that shall be so fate pronounced 
0	but thou o father i forewarn thee shun
0	his deadly arrow neither vainly hope
0	to be invulnerable in those bright arms 
0	through tempered heavenly for that mortal dint 
0	save he who reigns above none can resist 
0	she finished and the subtle fiend his lore
0	soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth 
0	 dear daughter since thou claim st me for thy sire 
0	and my fair son here show st me the dear pledge
0	of dalliance had with thee in heaven and joys
0	then sweet now sad to mention through dire change
0	befallen us unforeseen unthought of know 
0	i come no enemy but to set free
0	from out this dark and dismal house of pain
0	both him and thee and all the heavenly host
0	of spirits that in our just pretences armed 
0	fell with us from on high from them i go
0	this uncouth errand sole and one for all
0	myself expose with lonely steps to tread
0	th unfounded deep and through the void immense
0	to search with wandering quest a place foretold
0	should be and by concurring signs ere now
0	created vast and round a place of bliss
0	in the purlieus of heaven and therein placed
0	a race of upstart creatures to supply
0	perhaps our vacant room though more removed 
0	lest heaven surcharged with potent multitude 
0	might hap to move new broils be this or aught
0	than this more secret now designed i haste
0	to know and this once known shall soon return 
0	and bring ye to the place where thou and death
0	shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen
0	wing silently the buxom air embalmed
0	with odours there ye shall be fed and filled
0	immeasurably all things shall be your prey 
0	he ceased for both seemed highly pleased and death
0	grinned horrible a ghastly smile to hear
0	his famine should be filled and blessed his maw
0	destined to that good hour no less rejoiced
0	his mother bad and thus bespake her sire 
0	 the key of this infernal pit by due
0	and by command of heaven s all powerful king 
0	i keep by him forbidden to unlock
0	these adamantine gates against all force
0	death ready stands to interpose his dart 
0	fearless to be o ermatched by living might 
0	but what owe i to his commands above 
0	who hates me and hath hither thrust me down
0	into this gloom of tartarus profound 
0	to sit in hateful office here confined 
0	inhabitant of heaven and heavenly born 
0	here in perpetual agony and pain 
0	with terrors and with clamours compassed round
0	of mine own brood that on my bowels feed 
0	thou art my father thou my author thou

0	to that new world of light and bliss among
0	the gods who live at ease where i shall reign
0	at thy right hand voluptuous as beseems
0	thy daughter and thy darling without end 
0	thus saying from her side the fatal key 
0	sad instrument of all our woe she took 
0	and towards the gate rolling her bestial train 
0	forthwith the huge portcullis high up drew 
0	which but herself not all the stygian powers
0	could once have moved then in the key hole turns
0	th intricate wards and every bolt and bar
0	of massy iron or solid rock with ease
0	unfastens on a sudden open fly 
0	with impetuous recoil and jarring sound 
0	th infernal doors and on their hinges grate
0	harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook
0	of erebus she opened but to shut
0	excelled her power the gates wide open stood 
0	that with extended wings a bannered host 
0	under spread ensigns marching might pass through
0	with horse and chariots ranked in loose array 
0	so wide they stood and like a furnace mouth
0	cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame 
0	before their eyes in sudden view appear
0	the secrets of the hoary deep a dark
0	illimitable ocean without bound 
0	without dimension where length breadth and height 
0	and time and place are lost where eldest night
0	and chaos ancestors of nature hold
0	eternal anarchy amidst the noise
0	of endless wars and by confusion stand 
0	for hot cold moist and dry four champions fierce 
0	strive here for mastery and to battle bring
0	their embryon atoms they around the flag
0	of each his faction in their several clans 
0	light armed or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow 
0	swarm populous unnumbered as the sands
0	of barca or cyrene s torrid soil 
0	levied to side with warring winds and poise
0	their lighter wings to whom these most adhere
0	he rules a moment chaos umpire sits 
0	and by decision more embroils the fray
0	by which he reigns next him high arbiter 
0	chance governs all into this wild abyss 
0	the womb of nature and perhaps her grave 
0	of neither sea nor shore nor air nor fire 
0	but all these in their pregnant causes mixed
0	confusedly and which thus must ever fight 
0	unless th almighty maker them ordain
0	his dark materials to create more worlds 
0	into this wild abyss the wary fiend
0	stood on the brink of hell and looked a while 
0	pondering his voyage for no narrow frith
0	he had to cross nor was his ear less pealed
0	with noises loud and ruinous to compare
0	great things with small than when bellona storms
0	with all her battering engines bent to rase
0	some capital city or less than if this frame
0	of heaven were falling and these elements
0	in mutiny had from her axle torn
0	the steadfast earth at last his sail broad vans
0	he spread for flight and in the surging smoke
0	uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league 
0	as in a cloudy chair ascending rides
0	audacious but that seat soon failing meets
0	a vast vacuity all unawares 
0	fluttering his pennons vain plumb down he drops
0	ten thousand fathom deep and to this hour
0	down had been falling had not by ill chance 
0	the strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud 
0	instinct with fire and nitre hurried him
0	as many miles aloft that fury stayed 
0	quenched in a boggy syrtis neither sea 
0	nor good dry land nigh foundered on he fares 
0	treading the crude consistence half on foot 
0	half flying behoves him now both oar and sail 
0	as when a gryphon through the wilderness
0	with winged course o er hill or moory dale 
0	pursues the arimaspian who by stealth
0	had from his wakeful custody purloined
0	the guarded gold so eagerly the fiend
0	o er bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare 
0	with head hands wings or feet pursues his way 
0	and swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies 
0	at length a universal hubbub wild
0	of stunning sounds and voices all confused 
0	borne through the hollow dark assaults his ear
0	with loudest vehemence thither he plies
0	undaunted to meet there whatever power
0	or spirit of the nethermost abyss
0	might in that noise reside of whom to ask
0	which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
0	bordering on light when straight behold the throne
0	of chaos and his dark pavilion spread
0	wide on the wasteful deep with him enthroned
0	sat sable vested night eldest of things 
0	the consort of his reign and by them stood
0	orcus and ades and the dreaded name
0	of demogorgon rumour next and chance 
0	and tumult and confusion all embroiled 
0	and discord with a thousand various mouths 
0	t whom satan turning boldly thus ye powers
0	and spirits of this nethermost abyss 
0	chaos and ancient night i come no spy
0	with purpose to explore or to disturb
0	the secrets of your realm but by constraint
0	wandering this darksome desert as my way
0	lies through your spacious empire up to light 
0	alone and without guide half lost i seek 
0	what readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
0	confine with heaven or if some other place 
0	from your dominion won th ethereal king
0	possesses lately thither to arrive
0	i travel this profound direct my course 
0	directed no mean recompense it brings
0	to your behoof if i that region lost 
0	all usurpation thence expelled reduce
0	to her original darkness and your sway
0	 which is my present journey and once more
0	erect the standard there of ancient night 
0	yours be th advantage all mine the revenge 
0	thus satan and him thus the anarch old 
0	with faltering speech and visage incomposed 
0	answered i know thee stranger who thou art 
0	that mighty leading angel who of late
0	made head against heaven s king though overthrown 
0	i saw and heard for such a numerous host
0	fled not in silence through the frighted deep 
0	with ruin upon ruin rout on rout 
0	confusion worse confounded and heaven gates
0	poured out by millions her victorious bands 
0	pursuing i upon my frontiers here
0	keep residence if all i can will serve
0	that little which is left so to defend 
0	encroached on still through our intestine broils
0	weakening the sceptre of old night first hell 
0	your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath 
0	now lately heaven and earth another world
0	hung o er my realm linked in a golden chain
0	to that side heaven from whence your legions fell 
0	if that way be your walk you have not far 
0	so much the nearer danger go and speed 
0	havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain 
0	he ceased and satan stayed not to reply 
0	but glad that now his sea should find a shore 
0	with fresh alacrity and force renewed
0	springs upward like a pyramid of fire 
0	into the wild expanse and through the shock
0	of fighting elements on all sides round
0	environed wins his way harder beset
0	and more endangered than when argo passed
0	through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks 
0	or when ulysses on the larboard shunned
0	charybdis and by th other whirlpool steered 
0	so he with difficulty and labour hard
0	moved on with difficulty and labour he 
0	but he once passed soon after when man fell 
0	strange alteration sin and death amain 
0	following his track such was the will of heaven 
0	paved after him a broad and beaten way
0	over the dark abyss whose boiling gulf
0	tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length 
0	from hell continued reaching th utmost orb
0	of this frail world by which the spirits perverse
0	with easy intercourse pass to and fro
0	to tempt or punish mortals except whom
0	god and good angels guard by special grace 
0	but now at last the sacred influence
0	of light appears and from the walls of heaven
0	shoots far into the bosom of dim night
0	a glimmering dawn here nature first begins
0	her farthest verge and chaos to retire 
0	as from her outmost works a broken foe 
0	with tumult less and with less hostile din 
0	that satan with less toil and now with ease 
0	wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light 
0	and like a weather beaten vessel holds
0	gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn 
0	or in the emptier waste resembling air 
0	weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold
0	far off th empyreal heaven extended wide
0	in circuit undetermined square or round 
0	with opal towers and battlements adorned
0	of living sapphire once his native seat 
0	and fast by hanging in a golden chain 
0	this pendent world in bigness as a star
0	of smallest magnitude close by the moon 
0	thither full fraught with mischievous revenge 
0	accursed and in a cursed hour he hies 
0	hail holy light offspring of heaven firstborn 
0	or of the eternal coeternal beam
0	may i express thee unblam d since god is light 
0	and never but in unapproached light
0	dwelt from eternity dwelt then in thee
0	bright effluence of bright essence increate 
0	or hear st thou rather pure ethereal stream 
0	whose fountain who shall tell before the sun 
0	before the heavens thou wert and at the voice
0	of god as with a mantle didst invest
0	the rising world of waters dark and deep 
0	won from the void and formless infinite 
0	thee i re visit now with bolder wing 
0	escap d the stygian pool though long detain d
0	in that obscure sojourn while in my flight
0	through utter and through middle darkness borne 
0	with other notes than to the orphean lyre
0	i sung of chaos and eternal night 
0	taught by the heavenly muse to venture down
0	the dark descent and up to re ascend 
0	though hard and rare thee i revisit safe 
0	and feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou
0	revisit st not these eyes that roll in vain
0	to find thy piercing ray and find no dawn 
0	so thick a drop serene hath quench d their orbs 
0	or dim suffusion veil d yet not the more
0	cease i to wander where the muses haunt 
0	clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill 
0	smit with the love of sacred song but chief
0	thee sion and the flowery brooks beneath 
0	that wash thy hallow d feet and warbling flow 
0	nightly i visit nor sometimes forget
0	so were i equall d with them in renown 
0	thy sovran command that man should find grace 
0	blind thamyris and blind maeonides 
0	and tiresias and phineus prophets old 
0	then feed on thoughts that voluntary move
0	harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird
0	sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid
0	tunes her nocturnal note thus with the year
0	seasons return but not to me returns
0	day or the sweet approach of even or morn 
0	or sight of vernal bloom or summer s rose 
0	or flocks or herds or human face divine 
0	but cloud instead and ever during dark
0	surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men
0	cut off and for the book of knowledge fair
0	presented with a universal blank
0	of nature s works to me expung d and ras d 
0	and wisdom at one entrance quite shut out 
0	so much the rather thou celestial light 
0	shine inward and the mind through all her powers
0	irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence
0	purge and disperse that i may see and tell
0	of things invisible to mortal sight 
0	now had the almighty father from above 
0	from the pure empyrean where he sits
0	high thron d above all highth bent down his eye
0	his own works and their works at once to view 
0	stood thick as stars and from his sight receiv d

0	in blissful solitude he then survey d
0	hell and the gulf between and satan there
0	coasting the wall of heaven on this side night
0	in the dun air sublime and ready now
0	to stoop with wearied wings and willing feet 
0	on the bare outside of this world that seem d

0	transports our adversary whom no bounds
0	prescrib d no bars of hell nor all the chains
0	heap d on him there nor yet the main abyss
0	wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems
0	on desperate revenge that shall redound
0	upon his own rebellious head and now 
0	through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
0	not far off heaven in the precincts of light 
0	directly towards the new created world 
0	and man there plac d with purpose to assay
0	if him by force he can destroy or worse 
0	by some false guile pervert and shall pervert 
0	for man will hearken to his glozing lies 
0	and easily transgress the sole command 
0	sole pledge of his obedience so will fall
0	he and his faithless progeny whose fault 
0	whose but his own ingrate he had of me
0	all he could have i made him just and right 
0	sufficient to have stood though free to fall 
0	such i created all the ethereal powers
0	and spirits both them who stood and them who fail d 
0	freely they stood who stood and fell who fell 
0	not free what proof could they have given sincere
0	of true allegiance constant faith or love 
0	where only what they needs must do appear d 
0	not what they would what praise could they receive 
0	what pleasure i from such obedience paid 
0	when will and reason reason also is choice 
0	useless and vain of freedom both despoil d 
0	made passive both had serv d necessity 
0	not me they therefore as to right belong d 
0	so were created nor can justly accuse

0	or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
0	their own revolt not i if i foreknew 
0	foreknowledge had no influence on their fault 
0	which had no less proved certain unforeknown 
0	so without least impulse or shadow of fate 
0	or aught by me immutably foreseen 
0	they trespass authors to themselves in all
0	both what they judge and what they choose for so
0	i form d them free and free they must remain

0	then with the multitude of my redeemed 
0	shall enter heaven long absent and return 
0	father to see thy face wherein no cloud
0	of anger shall remain but peace assured
0	and reconcilement wrath shall be no more
0	thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire 
0	his words here ended but his meek aspect
0	silent yet spake and breathed immortal love
0	to mortal men above which only shone
0	filial obedience as a sacrifice
0	glad to be offered he attends the will
0	of his great father admiration seized
0	all heaven what this might mean and whither tend 
0	wondering but soon th almighty thus replied 
0	o thou in heaven and earth the only peace
0	found out for mankind under wrath o thou
0	my sole complacence well thou know st how dear
0	to me are all my works nor man the least 
0	though last created that for him i spare
0	thee from my bosom and right hand to save 
0	by losing thee a while the whole race lost 
0	thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem 
0	their nature also to thy nature join 
0	and be thyself man among men on earth 
0	made flesh when time shall be of virgin seed 
0	by wondrous birth be thou in adam s room
0	the head of all mankind though adam s son 
0	as in him perish all men so in thee 
0	as from a second root shall be restored
0	as many as are restored without thee none 
0	his crime makes guilty all his sons thy merit 
0	imputed shall absolve them who renounce
0	their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds 
0	and live in thee transplanted and from thee
0	receive new life so man as is most just 
0	shall satisfy for man be judged and die 
0	and dying rise and rising with him raise
0	his brethren ransomed with his own dear life 
0	so heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate 
0	giving to death and dying to redeem 
0	so dearly to redeem what hellish hate
0	so easily destroyed and still destroys
0	in those who when they may accept not grace 
0	nor shalt thou by descending to assume
0	man s nature lessen or degrade thine own 
0	because thou hast though throned in highest bliss
0	equal to god and equally enjoying
0	god like fruition quitted all to save
0	a world from utter loss and hast been found
0	by merit more than birthright son of god 
0	found worthiest to be so by being good 
0	far more than great or high because in thee
0	love hath abounded more than glory abounds 
0	therefore thy humiliation shall exalt
0	with thee thy manhood also to this throne 
0	here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign
0	both god and man son both of god and man 
0	anointed universal king all power
0	i give thee reign for ever and assume
0	thy merits under thee as head supreme 
0	thrones princedoms powers dominions i reduce 
0	all knees to thee shall bow of them that bide
0	in heaven or earth or under earth in hell 
0	when thou attended gloriously from heaven 
0	shalt in the sky appear and from thee send
0	the summoning arch angels to proclaim
0	thy dread tribunal forthwith from all winds 
0	the living and forthwith the cited dead
0	of all past ages to the general doom
0	shall hasten such a peal shall rouse their sleep 
0	then all thy saints assembled thou shalt judge
0	bad men and angels they arraigned shall sink
0	beneath thy sentence hell her numbers full 
0	thenceforth shall be for ever shut mean while
0	the world shall burn and from her ashes spring
0	new heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell 
0	and after all their tribulations long 
0	see golden days fruitful of golden deeds 
0	with joy and peace triumphing and fair truth 
0	then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by 
0	for regal scepter then no more shall need 
0	god shall be all in all but all ye gods 
0	adore him who to compass all this dies 
0	adore the son and honour him as me 
0	no sooner had the almighty ceased but all
0	the multitude of angels with a shout
0	loud as from numbers without number sweet
0	as from blest voices uttering joy heaven rung
0	with jubilee and loud hosannas filled
0	the eternal regions lowly reverent
0	towards either throne they bow and to the ground
0	with solemn adoration down they cast
0	their crowns inwove with amarant and gold 
0	immortal amarant a flower which once
0	in paradise fast by the tree of life 
0	began to bloom but soon for man s offence
0	to heaven removed where first it grew there grows 
0	and flowers aloft shading the fount of life 
0	and where the river of bliss through midst of heaven
0	rolls o er elysian flowers her amber stream 
0	with these that never fade the spirits elect
0	bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams 
0	now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright
0	pavement that like a sea of jasper shone 
0	impurpled with celestial roses smiled 
0	then crowned again their golden harps they took 
0	harps ever tuned that glittering by their side
0	like quivers hung and with preamble sweet
0	of charming symphony they introduce
0	their sacred song and waken raptures high 
0	no voice exempt no voice but well could join
0	melodious part such concord is in heaven 
0	thee father first they sung omnipotent 
0	eternal king the author of all being 
0	fountain of light thyself invisible
0	amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit st
0	throned inaccessible but when thou shadest
0	the full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud
0	drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine 
0	dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear 
0	yet dazzle heaven that brightest seraphim
0	approach not but with both wings veil their eyes 
0	thee next they sang of all creation first 
0	in whose conspicuous countenance without cloud
0	made visible the almighty father shines 
0	whom else no creature can behold on thee
0	impressed the effulgence of his glory abides 
0	transfused on thee his ample spirit rests 
0	he heaven of heavens and all the powers therein
0	by thee created and by thee threw down
0	the aspiring dominations thou that day
0	thy father s dreadful thunder didst not spare 
0	nor stop thy flaming chariot wheels that shook
0	heaven s everlasting frame while o er the necks
0	thou drovest of warring angels disarrayed 
0	back from pursuit thy powers with loud acclaim
0	thee only extolled son of thy father s might 
0	to execute fierce vengeance on his foes 
0	not so on man him through their malice fallen 
0	father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom
0	so strictly but much more to pity incline 
0	no sooner did thy dear and only son
0	perceive thee purposed not to doom frail man
0	so strictly but much more to pity inclined 
0	he to appease thy wrath and end the strife
0	of mercy and justice in thy face discerned 
0	regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
0	second to thee offered himself to die
0	for man s offence o unexampled love 
0	love no where to be found less than divine 
0	hail son of god saviour of men thy name
0	shall be the copious matter of my song
0	henceforth and never shall my heart thy praise
0	forget nor from thy father s praise disjoin 
0	thus they in heaven above the starry sphere 
0	their happy hours in joy and hymning spent 
0	mean while upon the firm opacous globe
0	of this round world whose first convex divides
0	the luminous inferiour orbs enclosed
0	from chaos and the inroad of darkness old 
0	satan alighted walks a globe far off
0	it seemed now seems a boundless continent
0	dark waste and wild under the frown of night
0	starless exposed and ever threatening storms
0	of chaos blustering round inclement sky 
0	save on that side which from the wall of heaven 
0	though distant far some small reflection gains
0	of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud 
0	here walked the fiend at large in spacious field 
0	as when a vultur on imaus bred 
0	whose snowy ridge the roving tartar bounds 
0	dislodging from a region scarce of prey
0	to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids 
0	on hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
0	of ganges or hydaspes indian streams 
0	but in his way lights on the barren plains
0	of sericana where chineses drive
0	with sails and wind their cany waggons light 
0	so on this windy sea of land the fiend
0	walked up and down alone bent on his prey 
0	alone for other creature in this place 
0	living or lifeless to be found was none 
0	none yet but store hereafter from the earth
0	up hither like aereal vapours flew
0	of all things transitory and vain when sin
0	with vanity had filled the works of men 
0	both all things vain and all who in vain things
0	built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame 
0	or happiness in this or the other life 
0	all who have their reward on earth the fruits
0	of painful superstition and blind zeal 
0	nought seeking but the praise of men here find
0	fit retribution empty as their deeds 
0	all the unaccomplished works of nature s hand 
0	abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed 
0	dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain 
0	till final dissolution wander here 
0	not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed 
0	those argent fields more likely habitants 
0	translated saints or middle spirits hold
0	betwixt the angelical and human kind 
0	hither of ill joined sons and daughters born
0	first from the ancient world those giants came
0	with many a vain exploit though then renowned 
0	the builders next of babel on the plain
0	of sennaar and still with vain design 
0	new babels had they wherewithal would build 
0	others came single he who to be deemed
0	a god leaped fondly into aetna flames 
0	empedocles and he who to enjoy
0	plato s elysium leaped into the sea 
0	cleombrotus and many more too long 
0	white black and gray with all their trumpery 
0	here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek
0	in golgotha him dead who lives in heaven 
0	and they who to be sure of paradise 
0	dying put on the weeds of dominick 
0	or in franciscan think to pass disguised 
0	they pass the planets seven and pass the fixed 
0	and that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
0	the trepidation talked and that first moved 
0	and now saint peter at heaven s wicket seems
0	to wait them with his keys and now at foot
0	of heaven s ascent they lift their feet when lo
0	a violent cross wind from either coast
0	blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
0	into the devious air then might ye see
0	cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost
0	and fluttered into rags then reliques beads 
0	indulgences dispenses pardons bulls 
0	the sport of winds all these upwhirled aloft 
0	fly o er the backside of the world far off
0	into a limbo large and broad since called
0	the paradise of fools to few unknown
0	long after now unpeopled and untrod 
0	all this dark globe the fiend found as he passed 
0	and long he wandered till at last a gleam
0	of dawning light turned thither ward in haste
0	his travelled steps far distant he descries
0	ascending by degrees magnificent
0	up to the wall of heaven a structure high 
0	at top whereof but far more rich appeared
0	the work as of a kingly palace gate 
0	with frontispiece of diamond and gold
0	embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
0	the portal shone inimitable on earth
0	by model or by shading pencil drawn 
0	these stairs were such as whereon jacob saw
0	angels ascending and descending bands
0	of guardians bright when he from esau fled
0	to padan aram in the field of luz
0	dreaming by night under the open sky
0	and waking cried this is the gate of heaven 
0	each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
0	there always but drawn up to heaven sometimes
0	viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed
0	of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
0	who after came from earth failing arrived
0	wafted by angels or flew o er the lake
0	rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds 
0	the stairs were then let down whether to dare
0	the fiend by easy ascent or aggravate
0	his sad exclusion from the doors of bliss 
0	direct against which opened from beneath 
0	just o er the blissful seat of paradise 
0	a passage down to the earth a passage wide 
0	wider by far than that of after times
0	over mount sion and though that were large 
0	over the promised land to god so dear 
0	by which to visit oft those happy tribes 
0	on high behests his angels to and fro
0	passed frequent and his eye with choice regard
0	from paneas the fount of jordan s flood 
0	to beersaba where the holy land
0	so wide the opening seemed where bounds were set
0	to darkness such as bound the ocean wave 
0	satan from hence now on the lower stair 
0	that scaled by steps of gold to heaven gate 
0	looks down with wonder at the sudden view
0	of all this world at once as when a scout 
0	through dark and desert ways with peril gone
0	all night at last by break of cheerful dawn
0	obtains the brow of some high climbing hill 
0	which to his eye discovers unaware
0	the goodly prospect of some foreign land
0	first seen or some renowned metropolis
0	with glistering spires and pinnacles adorned 
0	which now the rising sun gilds with his beams 
0	such wonder seised though after heaven seen 
0	the spirit malign but much more envy seised 
0	at sight of all this world beheld so fair 
0	round he surveys and well might where he stood
0	so high above the circling canopy
0	of night s extended shade from eastern point
0	of libra to the fleecy star that bears
0	andromeda far off atlantick seas
0	beyond the horizon then from pole to pole
0	he views in breadth and without longer pause
0	down right into the world s first region throws
0	his flight precipitant and winds with ease
0	through the pure marble air his oblique way
0	amongst innumerable stars that shone
0	stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds 
0	or other worlds they seemed or happy isles 
0	like those hesperian gardens famed of old 
0	fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales 
0	thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
0	he staid not to inquire above them all
0	the golden sun in splendour likest heaven 
0	allured his eye thither his course he bends
0	through the calm firmament but up or down 
0	by center or eccentrick hard to tell 
0	or longitude where the great luminary
0	aloof the vulgar constellations thick 
0	that from his lordly eye keep distance due 
0	dispenses light from far they as they move
0	their starry dance in numbers that compute
0	days months and years towards his all cheering lamp
0	turn swift their various motions or are turned
0	by his magnetick beam that gently warms
0	the universe and to each inward part
0	with gentle penetration though unseen 
0	shoots invisible virtue even to the deep 
0	so wonderously was set his station bright 
0	there lands the fiend a spot like which perhaps
0	astronomer in the sun s lucent orb
0	through his glazed optick tube yet never saw 
0	the place he found beyond expression bright 
0	compared with aught on earth metal or stone 
0	not all parts like but all alike informed
0	with radiant light as glowing iron with fire 
0	if metal part seemed gold part silver clear 
0	if stone carbuncle most or chrysolite 
0	ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone
0	in aaron s breast plate and a stone besides
0	imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen 
0	that stone or like to that which here below
0	philosophers in vain so long have sought 
0	in vain though by their powerful art they bind
0	volatile hermes and call up unbound
0	in various shapes old proteus from the sea 
0	drained through a limbeck to his native form 
0	what wonder then if fields and regions here
0	breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run
0	potable gold when with one virtuous touch
0	the arch chemick sun so far from us remote 
0	produces with terrestrial humour mixed 
0	here in the dark so many precious things
0	of colour glorious and effect so rare 
0	here matter new to gaze the devil met
0	undazzled far and wide his eye commands 
0	for sight no obstacle found here nor shade 
0	but all sun shine as when his beams at noon
0	culminate from the equator as they now
0	shot upward still direct whence no way round
0	shadow from body opaque can fall and the air 
0	no where so clear sharpened his visual ray
0	to objects distant far whereby he soon
0	saw within ken a glorious angel stand 
0	the same whom john saw also in the sun 
0	his back was turned but not his brightness hid 
0	of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
0	circled his head nor less his locks behind
0	illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
0	lay waving round on some great charge employed
0	he seemed or fixed in cogitation deep 
0	glad was the spirit impure as now in hope
0	to find who might direct his wandering flight
0	to paradise the happy seat of man 
0	his journey s end and our beginning woe 
0	but first he casts to change his proper shape 
0	which else might work him danger or delay 
0	and now a stripling cherub he appears 
0	not of the prime yet such as in his face
0	youth smiled celestial and to every limb
0	suitable grace diffused so well he feigned 
0	under a coronet his flowing hair
0	in curls on either cheek played wings he wore
0	of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold 
0	his habit fit for speed succinct and held
0	before his decent steps a silver wand 
0	he drew not nigh unheard the angel bright 
0	ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned 
0	admonished by his ear and straight was known
0	the arch angel uriel one of the seven
0	who in god s presence nearest to his throne 
0	stand ready at command and are his eyes
0	that run through all the heavens or down to the earth
0	bear his swift errands over moist and dry 
0	o er sea and land him satan thus accosts 
0	uriel for thou of those seven spirits that stand
0	in sight of god s high throne gloriously bright 
0	the first art wont his great authentick will
0	interpreter through highest heaven to bring 
0	where all his sons thy embassy attend 
0	and here art likeliest by supreme decree
0	like honour to obtain and as his eye
0	to visit oft this new creation round 
0	unspeakable desire to see and know
0	all these his wonderous works but chiefly man 
0	his chief delight and favour him for whom
0	all these his works so wonderous he ordained 
0	hath brought me from the quires of cherubim
0	alone thus wandering brightest seraph tell
0	in which of all these shining orbs hath man
0	his fixed seat or fixed seat hath none 
0	but all these shining orbs his choice to dwell 
0	that i may find him and with secret gaze
0	or open admiration him behold 
0	on whom the great creator hath bestowed
0	worlds and on whom hath all these graces poured 
0	that both in him and all things as is meet 
0	the universal maker we may praise 
0	who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
0	to deepest hell and to repair that loss 
0	created this new happy race of men
0	to serve him better wise are all his ways 
0	so spake the false dissembler unperceived 
0	for neither man nor angel can discern
0	hypocrisy the only evil that walks
0	invisible except to god alone 
0	by his permissive will through heaven and earth 
0	and oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps
0	at wisdom s gate and to simplicity
0	resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill
0	where no ill seems which now for once beguiled
0	uriel though regent of the sun and held
0	the sharpest sighted spirit of all in heaven 
0	who to the fraudulent impostor foul 
0	in his uprightness answer thus returned 
0	fair angel thy desire which tends to know
0	the works of god thereby to glorify
0	the great work master leads to no excess
0	that reaches blame but rather merits praise
0	the more it seems excess that led thee hither
0	from thy empyreal mansion thus alone 
0	to witness with thine eyes what some perhaps 
0	contented with report hear only in heaven 
0	for wonderful indeed are all his works 
0	pleasant to know and worthiest to be all
0	had in remembrance always with delight 
0	but what created mind can comprehend
0	their number or the wisdom infinite
0	that brought them forth but hid their causes deep 
0	i saw when at his word the formless mass 
0	this world s material mould came to a heap 
0	confusion heard his voice and wild uproar
0	stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined 
0	till at his second bidding darkness fled 
0	light shone and order from disorder sprung 
0	swift to their several quarters hasted then
0	the cumbrous elements earth flood air fire 
0	and this ethereal quintessence of heaven
0	flew upward spirited with various forms 
0	that rolled orbicular and turned to stars
0	numberless as thou seest and how they move 
0	each had his place appointed each his course 
0	the rest in circuit walls this universe 
0	look downward on that globe whose hither side
0	with light from hence though but reflected shines 
0	that place is earth the seat of man that light
0	his day which else as the other hemisphere 
0	night would invade but there the neighbouring moon
0	 so call that opposite fair star her aid
0	timely interposes and her monthly round
0	still ending still renewing through mid heaven 
0	with borrowed light her countenance triform
0	hence fills and empties to enlighten the earth 
0	and in her pale dominion checks the night 
0	that spot to which i point is paradise 
0	adam s abode those lofty shades his bower 
0	thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires 
0	thus said he turned and satan bowing low 
0	as to superiour spirits is wont in heaven 
0	where honour due and reverence none neglects 
0	took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath 
0	down from the ecliptick sped with hoped success 
0	throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel 
0	nor staid till on niphates top he lights 
0	o for that warning voice which he who saw
0	the apocalypse heard cry in heaven aloud 
0	then when the dragon put to second rout 
0	came furious down to be revenged on men 
0	woe to the inhabitants on earth that now 
0	while time was our first parents had been warned
0	the coming of their secret foe and scaped 
0	haply so scaped his mortal snare for now
0	satan now first inflamed with rage came down 
0	the tempter ere the accuser of mankind 
0	to wreak on innocent frail man his loss
0	of that first battle and his flight to hell 
0	yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold
0	far off and fearless nor with cause to boast 
0	begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth
0	now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast 
0	and like a devilish engine back recoils
0	upon himself horrour and doubt distract
0	his troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir
0	the hell within him for within him hell
0	he brings and round about him nor from hell
0	one step no more than from himself can fly
0	by change of place now conscience wakes despair 
0	that slumbered wakes the bitter memory
0	of what he was what is and what must be
0	worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue 
0	sometimes towards eden which now in his view
0	lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad 
0	sometimes towards heaven and the full blazing sun 
0	which now sat high in his meridian tower 
0	then much revolving thus in sighs began 
0	o thou that with surpassing glory crowned 
0	lookest from thy sole dominion like the god
0	of this new world at whose sight all the stars
0	hide their diminished heads to thee i call 
0	but with no friendly voice and add thy name 
0	of sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams 
0	that bring to my remembrance from what state
0	i fell how glorious once above thy sphere 
0	till pride and worse ambition threw me down
0	warring in heaven against heaven s matchless king 
0	ah wherefore he deserved no such return
0	from me whom he created what i was
0	in that bright eminence and with his good
0	upbraided none nor was his service hard 
0	what could be less than to afford him praise 
0	the easiest recompence and pay him thanks 
0	how due yet all his good proved ill in me 
0	and wrought but malice lifted up so high
0	i sdeined subjection and thought one step higher
0	would set me highest and in a moment quit
0	the debt immense of endless gratitude 
0	so burdensome still paying still to owe 
0	forgetful what from him i still received 
0	and understood not that a grateful mind
0	by owing owes not but still pays at once
0	indebted and discharged what burden then
0	o had his powerful destiny ordained
0	me some inferiour angel i had stood
0	then happy no unbounded hope had raised
0	ambition yet why not some other power
0	as great might have aspired and me though mean 
0	drawn to his part but other powers as great
0	fell not but stand unshaken from within
0	or from without to all temptations armed 
0	hadst thou the same free will and power to stand 
0	thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse 
0	but heaven s free love dealt equally to all 
0	be then his love accursed since love or hate 
0	to me alike it deals eternal woe 
0	nay cursed be thou since against his thy will
0	chose freely what it now so justly rues 
0	me miserable which way shall i fly
0	infinite wrath and infinite despair 
0	which way i fly is hell myself am hell 
0	and in the lowest deep a lower deep
0	still threatening to devour me opens wide 
0	to which the hell i suffer seems a heaven 
0	o then at last relent is there no place
0	left for repentance none for pardon left 
0	none left but by submission and that word
0	disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
0	among the spirits beneath whom i seduced
0	with other promises and other vaunts
0	than to submit boasting i could subdue
0	the omnipotent ay me they little know
0	how dearly i abide that boast so vain 
0	under what torments inwardly i groan 
0	while they adore me on the throne of hell 
0	with diadem and scepter high advanced 
0	the lower still i fall only supreme
0	in misery such joy ambition finds 
0	but say i could repent and could obtain 
0	by act of grace my former state how soon
0	would highth recall high thoughts how soon unsay
0	what feigned submission swore ease would recant
0	vows made in pain as violent and void 
0	for never can true reconcilement grow 
0	where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep 
0	which would but lead me to a worse relapse
0	and heavier fall so should i purchase dear
0	short intermission bought with double smart 
0	this knows my punisher therefore as far
0	from granting he as i from begging peace 
0	all hope excluded thus behold instead
0	of us out cast exil d his new delight 
0	mankind created and for him this world 
0	so farewell hope and with hope farewell fear 
0	farewell remorse all good to me is lost 
0	evil be thou my good by thee at least
0	divided empire with heaven s king i hold 
0	by thee and more than half perhaps will reign 
0	as man ere long and this new world shall know 
0	thus while he spake each passion dimmed his face
0	thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair 
0	which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed
0	him counterfeit if any eye beheld 
0	for heavenly minds from such distempers foul
0	are ever clear whereof he soon aware 
0	each perturbation smoothed with outward calm 
0	artificer of fraud and was the first
0	that practised falsehood under saintly show 
0	deep malice to conceal couched with revenge 
0	yet not enough had practised to deceive
0	uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down
0	the way he went and on the assyrian mount
0	saw him disfigured more than could befall
0	spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce
0	he marked and mad demeanour then alone 
0	as he supposed all unobserved unseen 
0	so on he fares and to the border comes
0	of eden where delicious paradise 
0	now nearer crowns with her enclosure green 
0	as with a rural mound the champaign head
0	of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides
0	with thicket overgrown grotesque and wild 
0	access denied and overhead upgrew
0	insuperable height of loftiest shade 
0	cedar and pine and fir and branching palm 
0	a sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend 
0	shade above shade a woody theatre
0	of stateliest view yet higher than their tops
0	the verdurous wall of paradise upsprung 
0	which to our general sire gave prospect large
0	into his nether empire neighbouring round 
0	and higher than that wall a circling row
0	of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit 
0	blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue 
0	appeared with gay enamelled colours mixed 
0	on which the sun more glad impressed his beams
0	than in fair evening cloud or humid bow 
0	when god hath showered the earth so lovely seemed
0	that landskip and of pure now purer air
0	meets his approach and to the heart inspires
0	vernal delight and joy able to drive
0	all sadness but despair now gentle gales 
0	fanning their odoriferous wings dispense
0	native perfumes and whisper whence they stole
0	those balmy spoils as when to them who fail
0	beyond the cape of hope and now are past
0	mozambick off at sea north east winds blow
0	sabean odours from the spicy shore
0	of araby the blest with such delay
0	well pleased they slack their course and many a league
0	cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles 
0	so entertained those odorous sweets the fiend 
0	who came their bane though with them better pleased
0	than asmodeus with the fishy fume
0	that drove him though enamoured from the spouse
0	of tobit s son and with a vengeance sent
0	now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
0	satan had journeyed on pensive and slow 
0	but further way found none so thick entwined 
0	as one continued brake the undergrowth
0	of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
0	all path of man or beast that passed that way 
0	one gate there only was and that looked east
0	on the other side which when the arch felon saw 
0	due entrance he disdained and in contempt 
0	at one flight bound high over leaped all bound
0	of hill or highest wall and sheer within
0	lights on his feet as when a prowling wolf 
0	whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey 
0	watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
0	in hurdled cotes amid the field secure 
0	leaps o er the fence with ease into the fold 
0	or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash
0	of some rich burgher whose substantial doors 
0	cross barred and bolted fast fear no assault 
0	in at the window climbs or o er the tiles 
0	so clomb this first grand thief into god s fold 
0	so since into his church lewd hirelings climb 
0	thence up he flew and on the tree of life 
0	the middle tree and highest there that grew 
0	sat like a cormorant yet not true life
0	thereby regained but sat devising death
0	to them who lived nor on the virtue thought
0	of that life giving plant but only used
0	for prospect what well used had been the pledge
0	of immortality so little knows
0	any but god alone to value right
0	the good before him but perverts best things
0	to worst abuse or to their meanest use 
0	beneath him with new wonder now he views 
0	to all delight of human sense exposed 
0	in narrow room nature s whole wealth yea more 
0	a heaven on earth for blissful paradise
0	of god the garden was by him in the east
0	of eden planted eden stretched her line
0	from auran eastward to the royal towers
0	of great seleucia built by grecian kings 
0	or where the sons of eden long before
0	dwelt in telassar in this pleasant soil
0	his far more pleasant garden god ordained 
0	out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
0	all trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste 
0	and all amid them stood the tree of life 
0	high eminent blooming ambrosial fruit
0	of vegetable gold and next to life 
0	our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by 
0	knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill 
0	southward through eden went a river large 
0	nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill
0	passed underneath ingulfed for god had thrown
0	that mountain as his garden mould high raised
0	upon the rapid current which through veins
0	of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn 
0	rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
0	watered the garden thence united fell
0	down the steep glade and met the nether flood 
0	which from his darksome passage now appears 
0	and now divided into four main streams 
0	runs diverse wandering many a famous realm
0	and country whereof here needs no account 
0	but rather to tell how if art could tell 
0	how from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks 
0	rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold 
0	with mazy errour under pendant shades
0	ran nectar visiting each plant and fed
0	flowers worthy of paradise which not nice art
0	in beds and curious knots but nature boon
0	poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain 
0	both where the morning sun first warmly smote
0	the open field and where the unpierced shade
0	imbrowned the noontide bowers thus was this place
0	a happy rural seat of various view 
0	groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm 
0	others whose fruit burnished with golden rind 
0	hung amiable hesperian fables true 
0	if true here only and of delicious taste 
0	betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks
0	grazing the tender herb were interposed 
0	or palmy hillock or the flowery lap
0	of some irriguous valley spread her store 
0	flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose 
0	another side umbrageous grots and caves
0	of cool recess o er which the mantling vine
0	lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps
0	luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall
0	down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake 
0	that to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
0	her crystal mirrour holds unite their streams 
0	the birds their quire apply airs vernal airs 
0	breathing the smell of field and grove attune
0	the trembling leaves while universal pan 
0	knit with the graces and the hours in dance 
0	led on the eternal spring not that fair field
0	of enna where proserpine gathering flowers 
0	herself a fairer flower by gloomy dis
0	was gathered which cost ceres all that pain
0	to seek her through the world nor that sweet grove
0	of daphne by orontes and the inspired
0	castalian spring might with this paradise
0	of eden strive nor that nyseian isle
0	girt with the river triton where old cham 
0	whom gentiles ammon call and libyan jove 
0	hid amalthea and her florid son
0	young bacchus from his stepdame rhea s eye 
0	nor where abassin kings their issue guard 
0	mount amara though this by some supposed
0	true paradise under the ethiop line
0	by nilus head enclosed with shining rock 
0	a whole day s journey high but wide remote
0	from this assyrian garden where the fiend
0	saw undelighted all delight all kind
0	of living creatures new to sight and strange
0	two of far nobler shape erect and tall 
0	godlike erect with native honour clad
0	in naked majesty seemed lords of all 
0	and worthy seemed for in their looks divine
0	the image of their glorious maker shone 
0	truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure 
0	 severe but in true filial freedom placed 
0	whence true authority in men though both
0	not equal as their sex not equal seemed 
0	for contemplation he and valour formed 
0	for softness she and sweet attractive grace 
0	he for god only she for god in him 
0	his fair large front and eye sublime declared
0	absolute rule and hyacinthine locks
0	round from his parted forelock manly hung
0	clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad 
0	she as a veil down to the slender waist
0	her unadorned golden tresses wore
0	dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved
0	as the vine curls her tendrils which implied
0	subjection but required with gentle sway 
0	and by her yielded by him best received 
0	yielded with coy submission modest pride 
0	and sweet reluctant amorous delay 
0	nor those mysterious parts were then concealed 
0	then was not guilty shame dishonest shame
0	of nature s works honour dishonourable 
0	sin bred how have ye troubled all mankind
0	with shows instead mere shows of seeming pure 
0	and banished from man s life his happiest life 
0	simplicity and spotless innocence 
0	so passed they naked on nor shunned the sight
0	of god or angel for they thought no ill 
0	so hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair 
0	that ever since in love s embraces met 
0	adam the goodliest man of men since born
0	his sons the fairest of her daughters eve 
0	under a tuft of shade that on a green
0	stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side
0	they sat them down and after no more toil
0	of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed
0	to recommend cool zephyr and made ease
0	more easy wholesome thirst and appetite
0	more grateful to their supper fruits they fell 
0	nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
0	yielded them side long as they sat recline
0	on the soft downy bank damasked with flowers 
0	the savoury pulp they chew and in the rind 
0	still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream 
0	nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles
0	wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems
0	fair couple linked in happy nuptial league 
0	alone as they about them frisking played
0	all beasts of the earth since wild and of all chase
0	in wood or wilderness forest or den 
0	sporting the lion ramped and in his paw
0	dandled the kid bears tigers ounces pards 
0	gambolled before them the unwieldy elephant 
0	to make them mirth used all his might and wreathed
0	his lithe proboscis close the serpent sly 
0	insinuating wove with gordian twine
0	his braided train and of his fatal guile
0	gave proof unheeded others on the grass
0	couched and now filled with pasture gazing sat 
0	or bedward ruminating for the sun 
0	declined was hasting now with prone career
0	to the ocean isles and in the ascending scale
0	of heaven the stars that usher evening rose 
0	when satan still in gaze as first he stood 
0	scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad 
0	o hell what do mine eyes with grief behold 
0	into our room of bliss thus high advanced
0	creatures of other mould earth born perhaps 
0	not spirits yet to heavenly spirits bright
0	little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue
0	with wonder and could love so lively shines
0	in them divine resemblance and such grace
0	the hand that formed them on their shape hath poured 
0	ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh
0	your change approaches when all these delights
0	will vanish and deliver ye to woe 
0	more woe the more your taste is now of joy 
0	happy but for so happy ill secured
0	long to continue and this high seat your heaven
0	ill fenced for heaven to keep out such a foe
0	as now is entered yet no purposed foe
0	to you whom i could pity thus forlorn 
0	though i unpitied league with you i seek 
0	and mutual amity so strait so close 
0	that i with you must dwell or you with me
0	henceforth my dwelling haply may not please 
0	like this fair paradise your sense yet such
0	accept your maker s work he gave it me 
0	which i as freely give hell shall unfold 
0	to entertain you two her widest gates 
0	and send forth all her kings there will be room 
0	not like these narrow limits to receive
0	your numerous offspring if no better place 
0	thank him who puts me loth to this revenge
0	on you who wrong me not for him who wronged 
0	and should i at your harmless innocence
0	melt as i do yet publick reason just 
0	honour and empire with revenge enlarged 
0	by conquering this new world compels me now
0	to do what else though damned i should abhor 
0	so spake the fiend and with necessity 
0	the tyrant s plea excused his devilish deeds 
0	then from his lofty stand on that high tree
0	down he alights among the sportful herd
0	of those four footed kinds himself now one 
0	now other as their shape served best his end
0	nearer to view his prey and unespied 
0	to mark what of their state he more might learn 
0	by word or action marked about them round
0	a lion now he stalks with fiery glare 
0	then as a tiger who by chance hath spied
0	in some purlieu two gentle fawns at play 
0	straight couches close then rising changes oft
0	his couchant watch as one who chose his ground 
0	whence rushing he might surest seize them both 
0	griped in each paw when adam first of men
0	to first of women eve thus moving speech 
0	turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow 
0	sole partner and sole part of all these joys 
0	dearer thyself than all needs must the power
0	that made us and for us this ample world 
0	be infinitely good and of his good
0	as liberal and free as infinite 
0	that raised us from the dust and placed us here
0	in all this happiness who at his hand
0	have nothing merited nor can perform
0	aught whereof he hath need he who requires
0	from us no other service than to keep
0	this one this easy charge of all the trees
0	in paradise that bear delicious fruit
0	so various not to taste that only tree
0	of knowledge planted by the tree of life 
0	so near grows death to life whate er death is 
0	some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest
0	god hath pronounced it death to taste that tree 
0	the only sign of our obedience left 
0	among so many signs of power and rule
0	conferred upon us and dominion given
0	over all other creatures that possess
0	earth air and sea then let us not think hard
0	one easy prohibition who enjoy
0	free leave so large to all things else and choice
0	unlimited of manifold delights 
0	but let us ever praise him and extol
0	his bounty following our delightful task 
0	to prune these growing plants and tend these flowers 
0	which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet 
0	to whom thus eve replied o thou for whom
0	and from whom i was formed flesh of thy flesh 
0	and without whom am to no end my guide
0	and head what thou hast said is just and right 
0	for we to him indeed all praises owe 
0	and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy
0	so far the happier lot enjoying thee
0	pre eminent by so much odds while thou
0	like consort to thyself canst no where find 
0	that day i oft remember when from sleep
0	i first awaked and found myself reposed
0	under a shade on flowers much wondering where
0	and what i was whence thither brought and how 
0	not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
0	of waters issued from a cave and spread
0	into a liquid plain then stood unmoved
0	pure as the expanse of heaven i thither went
0	with unexperienced thought and laid me down
0	on the green bank to look into the clear
0	smooth lake that to me seemed another sky 
0	as i bent down to look just opposite
0	a shape within the watery gleam appeared 
0	bending to look on me i started back 
0	it started back but pleased i soon returned 
0	pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
0	of sympathy and love there i had fixed
0	mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire 
0	had not a voice thus warned me what thou seest 
0	what there thou seest fair creature is thyself 
0	with thee it came and goes but follow me 
0	and i will bring thee where no shadow stays
0	thy coming and thy soft embraces he
0	whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy
0	inseparably thine to him shalt bear
0	multitudes like thyself and thence be called
0	mother of human race what could i do 
0	but follow straight invisibly thus led 
0	till i espied thee fair indeed and tall 
0	under a platane yet methought less fair 
0	less winning soft less amiably mild 
0	than that smooth watery image back i turned 
0	thou following cryedst aloud return fair eve 
0	whom flyest thou whom thou flyest of him thou art 
0	his flesh his bone to give thee being i lent
0	out of my side to thee nearest my heart 
0	substantial life to have thee by my side
0	henceforth an individual solace dear 
0	part of my soul i seek thee and thee claim
0	my other half with that thy gentle hand
0	seised mine i yielded and from that time see
0	how beauty is excelled by manly grace 
0	and wisdom which alone is truly fair 
0	so spake our general mother and with eyes
0	of conjugal attraction unreproved 
0	and meek surrender half embracing leaned
0	on our first father half her swelling breast
0	naked met his under the flowing gold
0	of her loose tresses hid he in delight
0	both of her beauty and submissive charms 
0	smiled with superiour love as jupiter
0	on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
0	that shed mayflowers and pressed her matron lip
0	with kisses pure aside the devil turned
0	for envy yet with jealous leer malign
0	eyed them askance and to himself thus plained 
0	sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two 
0	imparadised in one another s arms 
0	the happier eden shall enjoy their fill
0	of bliss on bliss while i to hell am thrust 
0	where neither joy nor love but fierce desire 
0	among our other torments not the least 
0	still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines 
0	yet let me not forget what i have gained
0	from their own mouths all is not theirs it seems 
0	one fatal tree there stands of knowledge called 
0	forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidden
0	suspicious reasonless why should their lord
0	envy them that can it be sin to know 
0	can it be death and do they only stand
0	by ignorance is that their happy state 
0	the proof of their obedience and their faith 
0	o fair foundation laid whereon to build
0	their ruin hence i will excite their minds
0	with more desire to know and to reject
0	envious commands invented with design
0	to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
0	equal with gods aspiring to be such 
0	they taste and die what likelier can ensue
0	but first with narrow search i must walk round
0	this garden and no corner leave unspied 
0	a chance but chance may lead where i may meet
0	some wandering spirit of heaven by fountain side 
0	or in thick shade retired from him to draw
0	what further would be learned live while ye may 
0	yet happy pair enjoy till i return 
0	short pleasures for long woes are to succeed 
0	so saying his proud step he scornful turned 
0	but with sly circumspection and began
0	through wood through waste o er hill o er dale his roam
0	mean while in utmost longitude where heaven
0	with earth and ocean meets the setting sun
0	slowly descended and with right aspect
0	against the eastern gate of paradise
0	levelled his evening rays it was a rock
0	of alabaster piled up to the clouds 
0	conspicuous far winding with one ascent
0	accessible from earth one entrance high 
0	the rest was craggy cliff that overhung
0	still as it rose impossible to climb 
0	betwixt these rocky pillars gabriel sat 
0	chief of the angelick guards awaiting night 
0	about him exercised heroick games
0	the unarmed youth of heaven but nigh at hand
0	celestial armoury shields helms and spears 
0	hung high with diamond flaming and with gold 
0	thither came uriel gliding through the even
0	on a sun beam swift as a shooting star
0	in autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired
0	impress the air and shows the mariner
0	from what point of his compass to beware
0	impetuous winds he thus began in haste 
0	gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given
0	charge and strict watch that to this happy place
0	no evil thing approach or enter in 
0	this day at highth of noon came to my sphere
0	a spirit zealous as he seemed to know
0	more of the almighty s works and chiefly man 
0	god s latest image i described his way
0	bent all on speed and marked his aery gait 
0	but in the mount that lies from eden north 
0	where he first lighted soon discerned his looks
0	alien from heaven with passions foul obscured 
0	mine eye pursued him still but under shade
0	lost sight of him one of the banished crew 
0	i fear hath ventured from the deep to raise
0	new troubles him thy care must be to find 
0	to whom the winged warriour thus returned 
0	uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight 
0	amid the sun s bright circle where thou sitst 
0	see far and wide in at this gate none pass
0	the vigilance here placed but such as come
0	well known from heaven and since meridian hour
0	no creature thence if spirit of other sort 
0	so minded have o er leaped these earthly bounds
0	on purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude
0	spiritual substance with corporeal bar 
0	but if within the circuit of these walks 
0	in whatsoever shape he lurk of whom
0	thou tellest by morrow dawning i shall know 
0	so promised he and uriel to his charge
0	returned on that bright beam whose point now raised
0	bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
0	beneath the azores whether the prime orb 
0	incredible how swift had thither rolled
0	diurnal or this less volubil earth 
0	by shorter flight to the east had left him there
0	arraying with reflected purple and gold
0	the clouds that on his western throne attend 
0	now came still evening on and twilight gray
0	had in her sober livery all things clad 
0	silence accompanied for beast and bird 
0	they to their grassy couch these to their nests
0	were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale 
0	she all night long her amorous descant sung 
0	silence was pleased now glowed the firmament
0	with living sapphires hesperus that led
0	the starry host rode brightest till the moon 
0	rising in clouded majesty at length
0	apparent queen unveiled her peerless light 
0	and o er the dark her silver mantle threw 
0	when adam thus to eve fair consort the hour
0	of night and all things now retired to rest 
0	mind us of like repose since god hath set
0	labour and rest as day and night to men
0	successive and the timely dew of sleep 
0	now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
0	our eye lids other creatures all day long
0	rove idle unemployed and less need rest 
0	man hath his daily work of body or mind
0	appointed which declares his dignity 
0	and the regard of heaven on all his ways 
0	while other animals unactive range 
0	and of their doings god takes no account 
0	to morrow ere fresh morning streak the east
0	with first approach of light we must be risen 
0	and at our pleasant labour to reform
0	yon flowery arbours yonder alleys green 
0	our walk at noon with branches overgrown 
0	that mock our scant manuring and require
0	more hands than ours to lop their wanton growth 
0	those blossoms also and those dropping gums 
0	that lie bestrown unsightly and unsmooth 
0	ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease 
0	mean while as nature wills night bids us rest 
0	to whom thus eve with perfect beauty adorned
0	my author and disposer what thou bidst
0	unargued i obey so god ordains 
0	god is thy law thou mine to know no more
0	is woman s happiest knowledge and her praise 
0	with thee conversing i forget all time 
0	all seasons and their change all please alike 
0	sweet is the breath of morn her rising sweet 
0	with charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun 
0	when first on this delightful land he spreads
0	his orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower 
0	glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth
0	after soft showers and sweet the coming on
0	of grateful evening mild then silent night 
0	with this her solemn bird and this fair moon 
0	and these the gems of heaven her starry train 
0	but neither breath of morn when she ascends
0	with charm of earliest birds nor rising sun
0	on this delightful land nor herb fruit flower 
0	glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers 
0	nor grateful evening mild nor silent night 
0	with this her solemn bird nor walk by moon 
0	or glittering star light without thee is sweet 
0	but wherefore all night long shine these for whom
0	this glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes 
0	to whom our general ancestor replied 
0	daughter of god and man accomplished eve 
0	these have their course to finish round the earth 
0	by morrow evening and from land to land
0	in order though to nations yet unborn 
0	ministring light prepared they set and rise 
0	lest total darkness should by night regain
0	her old possession and extinguish life
0	in nature and all things which these soft fires
0	not only enlighten but with kindly heat
0	of various influence foment and warm 
0	temper or nourish or in part shed down
0	their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
0	on earth made hereby apter to receive
0	perfection from the sun s more potent ray 
0	these then though unbeheld in deep of night 
0	shine not in vain nor think though men were none 
0	that heaven would want spectators god want praise 
0	millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
0	unseen both when we wake and when we sleep 
0	all these with ceaseless praise his works behold
0	both day and night how often from the steep
0	of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
0	celestial voices to the midnight air 
0	sole or responsive each to others note 
0	singing their great creator oft in bands
0	while they keep watch or nightly rounding walk 
0	with heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
0	in full harmonick number joined their songs
0	divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven 
0	thus talking hand in hand alone they passed
0	on to their blissful bower it was a place
0	chosen by the sovran planter when he framed
0	all things to man s delightful use the roof
0	of thickest covert was inwoven shade
0	laurel and myrtle and what higher grew
0	of firm and fragrant leaf on either side
0	acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub 
0	fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower 
0	iris all hues roses and jessamin 
0	reared high their flourished heads between and wrought
0	mosaick underfoot the violet 
0	crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay
0	broidered the ground more coloured than with stone
0	of costliest emblem other creature here 
0	bird beast insect or worm durst enter none 
0	such was their awe of man in shadier bower

0	and heavenly quires the hymenaean sung 
0	what day the genial angel to our sire
0	brought her in naked beauty more adorned 
0	more lovely than pandora whom the gods

0	in sad event when to the unwiser son

0	and starry pole thou also madest the night 
0	maker omnipotent and thou the day 
0	which we in our appointed work employed

0	and mutual love the crown of all our bliss
0	ordained by thee and this delicious place
0	for us too large where thy abundance wants
0	partakers and uncropt falls to the ground 
0	but thou hast promised from us two a race
0	to fill the earth who shall with us extol
0	thy goodness infinite both when we wake 
0	and when we seek as now thy gift of sleep 
0	this said unanimous and other rites

0	whatever hypocrites austerely talk

0	here love his golden shafts employs here lights

0	of harlots loveless joyless unendeared 
0	casual fruition nor in court amours 
0	mixed dance or wanton mask or midnight ball 
0	or serenate which the starved lover sings

0	and on their naked limbs the flowery roof
0	showered roses which the morn repaired sleep on 
0	blest pair and o yet happiest if ye seek
0	no happier state and know to know no more 
0	now had night measured with her shadowy cone
0	half way up hill this vast sublunar vault 
0	and from their ivory port the cherubim 
0	forth issuing at the accustomed hour stood armed
0	to their night watches in warlike parade 
0	when gabriel to his next in power thus spake 
0	uzziel half these draw off and coast the south
0	with strictest watch these other wheel the north 
0	our circuit meets full west as flame they part 
0	half wheeling to the shield half to the spear 
0	from these two strong and subtle spirits he called
0	that near him stood and gave them thus in charge 
0	ithuriel and zephon with winged speed
0	search through this garden leave unsearched no nook 
0	but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge 
0	now laid perhaps asleep secure of harm 
0	this evening from the sun s decline arrived 
0	who tells of some infernal spirit seen
0	hitherward bent who could have thought escaped
0	the bars of hell on errand bad no doubt 
0	such where ye find seise fast and hither bring 
0	so saying on he led his radiant files 
0	dazzling the moon these to the bower direct
0	in search of whom they sought him there they found
0	squat like a toad close at the ear of eve 
0	assaying by his devilish art to reach
0	the organs of her fancy and with them forge
0	illusions as he list phantasms and dreams 
0	or if inspiring venom he might taint
0	the animal spirits that from pure blood arise
0	like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
0	at least distempered discontented thoughts 
0	vain hopes vain aims inordinate desires 
0	blown up with high conceits ingendering pride 
0	him thus intent ithuriel with his spear
0	touched lightly for no falshood can endure
0	touch of celestial temper but returns
0	of force to its own likeness up he starts
0	discovered and surprised as when a spark
0	lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
0	fit for the tun some magazine to store
0	against a rumoured war the smutty grain 
0	with sudden blaze diffused inflames the air 
0	so started up in his own shape the fiend 
0	back stept those two fair angels half amazed
0	so sudden to behold the grisly king 
0	yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon 
0	which of those rebel spirits adjudged to hell
0	comest thou escaped thy prison and transformed 
0	why sat st thou like an enemy in wait 
0	here watching at the head of these that sleep 
0	know ye not then said satan filled with scorn 
0	know ye not me ye knew me once no mate
0	for you there sitting where ye durst not soar 
0	not to know me argues yourselves unknown 
0	the lowest of your throng or if ye know 
0	why ask ye and superfluous begin
0	your message like to end as much in vain 
0	to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn 
0	think not revolted spirit thy shape the same 
0	or undiminished brightness to be known 
0	as when thou stoodest in heaven upright and pure 
0	that glory then when thou no more wast good 
0	departed from thee and thou resemblest now
0	thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul 
0	but come for thou be sure shalt give account
0	to him who sent us whose charge is to keep
0	this place inviolable and these from harm 
0	so spake the cherub and his grave rebuke 
0	severe in youthful beauty added grace
0	invincible abashed the devil stood 
0	and felt how awful goodness is and saw
0	virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined
0	his loss but chiefly to find here observed
0	his lustre visibly impaired yet seemed
0	undaunted if i must contend said he 
0	best with the best the sender not the sent 
0	or all at once more glory will be won 
0	or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold 
0	will save us trial what the least can do
0	single against thee wicked and thence weak 
0	the fiend replied not overcome with rage 
0	but like a proud steed reined went haughty on 
0	champing his iron curb to strive or fly
0	he held it vain awe from above had quelled
0	his heart not else dismayed now drew they nigh
0	the western point where those half rounding guards
0	just met and closing stood in squadron joined 
0	a waiting next command to whom their chief 
0	gabriel from the front thus called aloud 
0	o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet
0	hasting this way and now by glimpse discern
0	ithuriel and zephon through the shade 
0	and with them comes a third of regal port 
0	but faded splendour wan who by his gait
0	and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell 
0	not likely to part hence without contest 
0	stand firm for in his look defiance lours 
0	he scarce had ended when those two approached 
0	and brief related whom they brought where found 
0	how busied in what form and posture couched 
0	to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake 
0	why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescribed
0	to thy transgressions and disturbed the charge
0	of others who approve not to transgress
0	by thy example but have power and right
0	to question thy bold entrance on this place 
0	employed it seems to violate sleep and those
0	whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss 
0	to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow 
0	gabriel thou hadst in heaven the esteem of wise 
0	and such i held thee but this question asked
0	puts me in doubt lives there who loves his pain 
0	who would not finding way break loose from hell 
0	though thither doomed thou wouldst thyself no doubt
0	and boldly venture to whatever place
0	farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
0	torment with ease and soonest recompense
0	dole with delight which in this place i sought 
0	to thee no reason who knowest only good 
0	but evil hast not tried and wilt object
0	his will who bounds us let him surer bar
0	his iron gates if he intends our stay
0	in that dark durance thus much what was asked 
0	the rest is true they found me where they say 
0	but that implies not violence or harm 
0	thus he in scorn the warlike angel moved 
0	disdainfully half smiling thus replied 
0	o loss of one in heaven to judge of wise
0	since satan fell whom folly overthrew 
0	and now returns him from his prison scaped 
0	gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
0	or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
0	unlicensed from his bounds in hell prescribed 
0	so wise he judges it to fly from pain
0	however and to scape his punishment 
0	so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath 
0	which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight
0	sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell 
0	which taught thee yet no better that no pain
0	can equal anger infinite provoked 
0	but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee
0	came not all hell broke loose or thou than they
0	less hardy to endure courageous chief 
0	the first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged
0	to thy deserted host this cause of flight 
0	thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive 
0	to which the fiend thus answered frowning stern 
0	not that i less endure or shrink from pain 
0	insulting angel well thou knowest i stood
0	thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid
0	the blasting vollied thunder made all speed 
0	and seconded thy else not dreaded spear 
0	but still thy words at random as before 
0	argue thy inexperience what behoves
0	from hard assays and ill successes past
0	a faithful leader not to hazard all
0	through ways of danger by himself untried 
0	i therefore i alone first undertook
0	to wing the desolate abyss and spy
0	this new created world whereof in hell
0	fame is not silent here in hope to find
0	better abode and my afflicted powers
0	to settle here on earth or in mid air 
0	though for possession put to try once more
0	what thou and thy gay legions dare against 
0	whose easier business were to serve their lord
0	high up in heaven with songs to hymn his throne 
0	and practised distances to cringe not fight 
0	to whom the warriour angel soon replied 
0	to say and straight unsay pretending first
0	wise to fly pain professing next the spy 
0	argues no leader but a liar traced 
0	satan and couldst thou faithful add o name 
0	o sacred name of faithfulness profaned 
0	faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew 
0	army of fiends fit body to fit head 
0	was this your discipline and faith engaged 
0	your military obedience to dissolve
0	allegiance to the acknowledged power supreme 
0	and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
0	patron of liberty who more than thou
0	once fawned and cringed and servilely adored
0	heaven s awful monarch wherefore but in hope
0	to dispossess him and thyself to reign 
0	but mark what i arreed thee now avant 
0	fly neither whence thou fledst if from this hour
0	within these hallowed limits thou appear 
0	back to the infernal pit i drag thee chained 
0	and seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn
0	the facile gates of hell too slightly barred 
0	so threatened he but satan to no threats
0	gave heed but waxing more in rage replied 
0	then when i am thy captive talk of chains 
0	proud limitary cherub but ere then
0	far heavier load thyself expect to feel
0	from my prevailing arm though heaven s king
0	ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers 
0	us d to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels
0	in progress through the road of heaven star paved 
0	while thus he spake the angelick squadron bright
0	turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns
0	their phalanx and began to hem him round
0	with ported spears as thick as when a field
0	of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
0	her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
0	sways them the careful plowman doubting stands 
0	left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
0	prove chaff on the other side satan alarmed 
0	collecting all his might dilated stood 
0	like teneriff or atlas unremoved 
0	his stature reached the sky and on his crest
0	sat horrour plumed nor wanted in his grasp
0	what seemed both spear and shield now dreadful deeds
0	might have ensued nor only paradise
0	in this commotion but the starry cope
0	of heaven perhaps or all the elements
0	at least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn
0	with violence of this conflict had not soon
0	the eternal to prevent such horrid fray 
0	hung forth in heaven his golden scales yet seen
0	betwixt astrea and the scorpion sign 
0	wherein all things created first he weighed 
0	the pendulous round earth with balanced air
0	in counterpoise now ponders all events 
0	battles and realms in these he put two weights 
0	the sequel each of parting and of fight 
0	the latter quick up flew and kicked the beam 
0	which gabriel spying thus bespake the fiend 
0	satan i know thy strength and thou knowest mine 
0	neither our own but given what folly then
0	to boast what arms can do since thine no more
0	than heaven permits nor mine though doubled now
0	to trample thee as mire for proof look up 
0	and read thy lot in yon celestial sign 
0	where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak 
0	if thou resist the fiend looked up and knew
0	his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled
0	murmuring and with him fled the shades of night 
0	now morn her rosy steps in the eastern clime
0	advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl 
0	when adam waked so customed for his sleep
0	was aery light from pure digestion bred 
0	and temperate vapours bland which the only sound
0	of leaves and fuming rills aurora s fan 
0	lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song
0	of birds on every bough so much the more
0	his wonder was to find unwakened eve
0	with tresses discomposed and glowing cheek 
0	as through unquiet rest he on his side
0	leaning half raised with looks of cordial love
0	hung over her enamoured and beheld
0	beauty which whether waking or asleep 
0	shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
0	mild as when zephyrus on flora breathes 
0	her hand soft touching whispered thus awake 
0	my fairest my espoused my latest found 
0	heaven s last best gift my ever new delight 
0	awake the morning shines and the fresh field
0	calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
0	our tender plants how blows the citron grove 
0	what drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed 
0	how nature paints her colours how the bee
0	sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet 
0	such whispering waked her but with startled eye
0	on adam whom embracing thus she spake 
0	o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose 
0	my glory my perfection glad i see
0	thy face and morn returned for i this night
0	 such night till this i never passed have dreamed 
0	if dreamed not as i oft am wont of thee 
0	works of day past or morrow s next design 
0	but of offence and trouble which my mind
0	knew never till this irksome night methought 
0	close at mine ear one called me forth to walk
0	with gentle voice i thought it thine it said 
0	 why sleepest thou eve now is the pleasant time 
0	the cool the silent save where silence yields
0	to the night warbling bird that now awake
0	tunes sweetest his love laboured song now reigns
0	full orbed the moon and with more pleasing light
0	shadowy sets off the face of things in vain 
0	if none regard heaven wakes with all his eyes 
0	whom to behold but thee nature s desire 
0	in whose sight all things joy with ravishment
0	attracted by thy beauty still to gaze 
0	i rose as at thy call but found thee not 
0	to find thee i directed then my walk 
0	and on methought alone i passed through ways
0	that brought me on a sudden to the tree
0	of interdicted knowledge fair it seemed 
0	much fairer to my fancy than by day 
0	and as i wondering looked beside it stood
0	one shaped and winged like one of those from heaven
0	by us oft seen his dewy locks distilled
0	ambrosia on that tree he also gazed 
0	and o fair plant said he with fruit surcharged 
0	deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet 
0	nor god nor man is knowledge so despised 
0	or envy or what reserve forbids to taste 
0	forbid who will none shall from me withhold
0	longer thy offered good why else set here 
0	this said he paused not but with venturous arm
0	he plucked he tasted me damp horrour chilled
0	at such bold words vouched with a deed so bold 
0	but he thus overjoyed o fruit divine 
0	sweet of thyself but much more sweet thus cropt 
0	forbidden here it seems as only fit
0	for gods yet able to make gods of men 
0	and why not gods of men since good the more
0	communicated more abundant grows 
0	the author not impaired but honoured more 
0	here happy creature fair angelick eve 
0	partake thou also happy though thou art 
0	happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be 
0	taste this and be henceforth among the gods
0	thyself a goddess not to earth confined 
0	but sometimes in the air as we sometimes
0	ascend to heaven by merit thine and see
0	what life the gods live there and such live thou 
0	so saying he drew nigh and to me held 
0	even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
0	which he had plucked the pleasant savoury smell
0	so quickened appetite that i methought 
0	could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds
0	with him i flew and underneath beheld
0	the earth outstretched immense a prospect wide
0	and various wondering at my flight and change
0	to this high exaltation suddenly
0	my guide was gone and i methought sunk down 
0	and fell asleep but o how glad i waked
0	to find this but a dream thus eve her night
0	related and thus adam answered sad 
0	best image of myself and dearer half 
0	the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
0	affects me equally nor can i like
0	this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear 
0	yet evil whence in thee can harbour none 
0	created pure but know that in the soul
0	are many lesser faculties that serve
0	reason as chief among these fancy next
0	her office holds of all external things
0	which the five watchful senses represent 
0	she forms imaginations aery shapes 
0	which reason joining or disjoining frames
0	all what we affirm or what deny and call
0	our knowledge or opinion then retires
0	into her private cell when nature rests 
0	oft in her absence mimick fancy wakes
0	to imitate her but misjoining shapes 
0	wild work produces oft and most in dreams 
0	ill matching words and deeds long past or late 
0	some such resemblances methinks i find
0	of our last evening s talk in this thy dream 
0	but with addition strange yet be not sad 
0	evil into the mind of god or man
0	may come and go so unreproved and leave
0	no spot or blame behind which gives me hope
0	that what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream 
0	waking thou never will consent to do 
0	be not disheartened then nor cloud those looks 
0	that wont to be more cheerful and serene 
0	than when fair morning first smiles on the world 
0	and let us to our fresh employments rise
0	among the groves the fountains and the flowers
0	that open now their choisest bosomed smells 
0	reserved from night and kept for thee in store 
0	so cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered 
0	but silently a gentle tear let fall
0	from either eye and wiped them with her hair 
0	two other precious drops that ready stood 
0	each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell
0	kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
0	and pious awe that feared to have offended 
0	so all was cleared and to the field they haste 
0	but first from under shady arborous roof
0	soon as they forth were come to open sight
0	of day spring and the sun who scarce up risen 
0	with wheels yet hovering o er the ocean brim 
0	shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray 
0	discovering in wide landskip all the east
0	of paradise and eden s happy plains 
0	lowly they bowed adoring and began
0	their orisons each morning duly paid
0	in various style for neither various style
0	nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
0	their maker in fit strains pronounced or sung
0	unmeditated such prompt eloquence
0	flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse 
0	more tuneable than needed lute or harp
0	to add more sweetness and they thus began 
0	these are thy glorious works parent of good 
0	almighty thine this universal frame 
0	thus wonderous fair thyself how wonderous then 
0	unspeakable who sitst above these heavens
0	to us invisible or dimly seen
0	in these thy lowest works yet these declare
0	thy goodness beyond thought and power divine 
0	speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light 
0	angels for ye behold him and with songs
0	and choral symphonies day without night 
0	circle his throne rejoicing ye in heaven
0	on earth join all ye creatures to extol
0	him first him last him midst and without end 
0	fairest of stars last in the train of night 
0	if better thou belong not to the dawn 
0	sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn
0	with thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere 
0	while day arises that sweet hour of prime 
0	thou sun of this great world both eye and soul 
0	acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise
0	in thy eternal course both when thou climbest 
0	and when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest 
0	moon that now meetest the orient sun now flyest 
0	with the fixed stars fixed in their orb that flies 
0	and ye five other wandering fires that move
0	in mystick dance not without song resound
0	his praise who out of darkness called up light 
0	air and ye elements the eldest birth
0	of nature s womb that in quaternion run
0	perpetual circle multiform and mix
0	and nourish all things let your ceaseless change
0	vary to our great maker still new praise 
0	ye mists and exhalations that now rise
0	from hill or steaming lake dusky or gray 
0	till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold 
0	in honour to the world s great author rise 
0	whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky 
0	or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers 
0	rising or falling still advance his praise 
0	his praise ye winds that from four quarters blow 
0	breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye pines 
0	with every plant in sign of worship wave 
0	fountains and ye that warble as ye flow 
0	melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise 
0	join voices all ye living souls ye birds 
0	that singing up to heaven gate ascend 
0	bear on your wings and in your notes his praise 
0	ye that in waters glide and ye that walk
0	the earth and stately tread or lowly creep 
0	witness if i be silent morn or even 
0	to hill or valley fountain or fresh shade 
0	made vocal by my song and taught his praise 
0	hail universal lord be bounteous still
0	to give us only good and if the night
0	have gathered aught of evil or concealed 
0	disperse it as now light dispels the dark 
0	so prayed they innocent and to their thoughts
0	firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm 
0	on to their morning s rural work they haste 
0	among sweet dews and flowers where any row
0	of fruit trees over woody reached too far
0	their pampered boughs and needed hands to check
0	fruitless embraces or they led the vine
0	to wed her elm she spoused about him twines
0	her marriageable arms and with him brings
0	her dower the adopted clusters to adorn
0	his barren leaves them thus employed beheld
0	with pity heaven s high king and to him called
0	raphael the sociable spirit that deigned
0	to travel with tobias and secured
0	his marriage with the seventimes wedded maid 
0	raphael said he thou hearest what stir on earth
0	satan from hell scaped through the darksome gulf 
0	hath raised in paradise and how disturbed
0	this night the human pair how he designs
0	in them at once to ruin all mankind 
0	go therefore half this day as friend with friend
0	converse with adam in what bower or shade
0	thou findest him from the heat of noon retired 
0	to respite his day labour with repast 
0	or with repose and such discourse bring on 
0	as may advise him of his happy state 
0	happiness in his power left free to will 
0	left to his own free will his will though free 
0	yet mutable whence warn him to beware
0	he swerve not too secure tell him withal
0	his danger and from whom what enemy 
0	late fallen himself from heaven is plotting now
0	the fall of others from like state of bliss 
0	by violence no for that shall be withstood 
0	but by deceit and lies this let him know 
0	lest wilfully transgressing he pretend
0	surprisal unadmonished unforewarned 
0	so spake the eternal father and fulfilled
0	all justice nor delayed the winged saint
0	after his charge received but from among
0	thousand celestial ardours where he stood
0	veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light 
0	flew through the midst of heaven the angelick quires 
0	on each hand parting to his speed gave way
0	through all the empyreal road till at the gate
0	of heaven arrived the gate self opened wide
0	on golden hinges turning as by work
0	divine the sovran architect had framed 
0	from hence no cloud or to obstruct his sight 
0	star interposed however small he sees 
0	not unconformed to other shining globes 
0	earth and the garden of god with cedars crowned
0	above all hills as when by night the glass
0	of galileo less assured observes
0	imagined lands and regions in the moon 
0	or pilot from amidst the cyclades
0	delos or samos first appearing kens
0	a cloudy spot down thither prone in flight
0	he speeds and through the vast ethereal sky
0	sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing
0	now on the polar winds then with quick fan
0	winnows the buxom air till within soar
0	of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems
0	a phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird 
0	when to enshrine his reliques in the sun s
0	at once on the eastern cliff of paradise
0	he lights and to his proper shape returns
0	a seraph winged six wings he wore to shade
0	his lineaments divine the pair that clad
0	each shoulder broad came mantling o er his breast
0	with regal ornament the middle pair
0	girt like a starry zone his waist and round

0	shadowed from either heel with feathered mail 
0	sky tinctured grain like maia s son he stood 
0	and shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled
0	the circuit wide straight knew him all the bands
0	of angels under watch and to his state

0	for on some message high they guessed him bound 
0	their glittering tents he passed and now is come
0	into the blissful field through groves of myrrh 
0	and flowering odours cassia nard and balm 
0	a wilderness of sweets for nature here
0	wantoned as in her prime and played at will
0	her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet

0	him through the spicy forest onward come
0	adam discerned as in the door he sat
0	of his cool bower while now the mounted sun
0	shot down direct his fervid rays to warm
0	earth s inmost womb more warmth than adam needs 
0	and eve within due at her hour prepared
0	for dinner savoury fruits of taste to please
0	true appetite and not disrelish thirst
0	of nectarous draughts between from milky stream 
0	berry or grape to whom thus adam called 
0	haste hither eve and worth thy sight behold
0	eastward among those trees what glorious shape
0	comes this way moving seems another morn
0	risen on mid noon some great behest from heaven
0	to us perhaps he brings and will vouchsafe
0	this day to be our guest but go with speed 
0	and what thy stores contain bring forth and pour
0	abundance fit to honour and receive
0	our heavenly stranger well we may afford
0	our givers their own gifts and large bestow
0	from large bestowed where nature multiplies
0	her fertile growth and by disburthening grows
0	more fruitful which instructs us not to spare 
0	to whom thus eve adam earth s hallowed mould 
0	of god inspired small store will serve where store 
0	all seasons ripe for use hangs on the stalk 
0	save what by frugal storing firmness gains
0	to nourish and superfluous moist consumes 
0	but i will haste and from each bough and brake 
0	each plant and juciest gourd will pluck such choice
0	to entertain our angel guest as he
0	beholding shall confess that here on earth
0	god hath dispensed his bounties as in heaven 
0	so saying with dispatchful looks in haste
0	she turns on hospitable thoughts intent
0	what choice to choose for delicacy best 
0	what order so contrived as not to mix
0	tastes not well joined inelegant but bring
0	taste after taste upheld with kindliest change 
0	bestirs her then and from each tender stalk
0	whatever earth all bearing mother yields
0	in india east or west or middle shore

0	she tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold
0	wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground
0	with rose and odours from the shrub unfumed 
0	mean while our primitive great sire to meet
0	his god like guest walks forth without more train
0	accompanied than with his own complete
0	perfections in himself was all his state 
0	more solemn than the tedious pomp that waits
0	on princes when their rich retinue long
0	of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold 
0	dazzles the croud and sets them all agape 
0	nearer his presence adam though not awed 
0	yet with submiss approach and reverence meek 
0	as to a superiour nature bowing low 
0	thus said native of heaven for other place
0	none can than heaven such glorious shape contain 
0	since by descending from the thrones above 
0	those happy places thou hast deigned a while
0	to want and honour these vouchsafe with us
0	two only who yet by sovran gift possess
0	this spacious ground in yonder shady bower
0	to rest and what the garden choicest bears
0	to sit and taste till this meridian heat
0	be over and the sun more cool decline 
0	whom thus the angelick virtue answered mild 
0	adam i therefore came nor art thou such
0	created or such place hast here to dwell 
0	as may not oft invite though spirits of heaven 
0	to visit thee lead on then where thy bower
0	o ershades for these mid hours till evening rise 
0	i have at will so to the sylvan lodge
0	they came that like pomona s arbour smiled 
0	with flowerets decked and fragrant smells but eve 
0	undecked save with herself more lovely fair
0	than wood nymph or the fairest goddess feigned
0	of three that in mount ida naked strove 
0	stood to entertain her guest from heaven no veil
0	she needed virtue proof no thought infirm
0	altered her cheek on whom the angel hail
0	bestowed the holy salutation used
0	long after to blest mary second eve 
0	hail mother of mankind whose fruitful womb
0	shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons 
0	than with these various fruits the trees of god
0	have heaped this table raised of grassy turf
0	their table was and mossy seats had round 
0	and on her ample square from side to side
0	all autumn piled though spring and autumn here
0	danced hand in hand a while discourse they hold 
0	no fear lest dinner cool when thus began
0	our author heavenly stranger please to taste
0	these bounties which our nourisher from whom
0	all perfect good unmeasured out descends 
0	to us for food and for delight hath caused
0	the earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps
0	to spiritual natures only this i know 
0	that one celestial father gives to all 
0	to whom the angel therefore what he gives
0	 whose praise be ever sung to man in part
0	spiritual may of purest spirits be found
0	no ingrateful food and food alike those pure
0	intelligential substances require 
0	as doth your rational and both contain
0	within them every lower faculty
0	of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste 
0	tasting concoct digest assimilate 
0	and corporeal to incorporeal turn 
0	for know whatever was created needs
0	to be sustained and fed of elements
0	the grosser feeds the purer earth the sea 
0	earth and the sea feed air the air those fires
0	ethereal and as lowest first the moon 
0	whence in her visage round those spots unpurged
0	vapours not yet into her substance turned 
0	nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale
0	from her moist continent to higher orbs 
0	the sun that light imparts to all receives
0	from all his alimental recompence
0	in humid exhalations and at even
0	sups with the ocean though in heaven the trees
0	of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines
0	yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn
0	we brush mellifluous dews and find the ground
0	covered with pearly grain yet god hath here
0	varied his bounty so with new delights 
0	as may compare with heaven and to taste
0	think not i shall be nice so down they sat 
0	and to their viands fell nor seemingly
0	the angel nor in mist the common gloss
0	of theologians but with keen dispatch
0	of real hunger and concoctive heat
0	to transubstantiate what redounds transpires
0	through spirits with ease nor wonder if by fire
0	of sooty coal the empirick alchemist
0	can turn or holds it possible to turn 
0	metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold 
0	as from the mine mean while at table eve
0	ministered naked and their flowing cups
0	with pleasant liquours crowned o innocence
0	deserving paradise if ever then 
0	then had the sons of god excuse to have been
0	enamoured at that sight but in those hearts
0	love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy
0	was understood the injured lover s hell 
0	thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed 
0	not burdened nature sudden mind arose
0	in adam not to let the occasion pass
0	given him by this great conference to know
0	of things above his world and of their being
0	who dwell in heaven whose excellence he saw
0	transcend his own so far whose radiant forms 
0	divine effulgence whose high power so far
0	exceeded human and his wary speech
0	thus to the empyreal minister he framed 
0	inhabitant with god now know i well
0	thy favour in this honour done to man 
0	under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed
0	to enter and these earthly fruits to taste 
0	food not of angels yet accepted so 
0	as that more willingly thou couldst not seem
0	at heaven s high feasts to have fed yet what compare
0	to whom the winged hierarch replied 
0	o adam one almighty is from whom
0	all things proceed and up to him return 
0	if not depraved from good created all
0	such to perfection one first matter all 
0	endued with various forms various degrees
0	of substance and in things that live of life 
0	but more refined more spiritous and pure 
0	as nearer to him placed or nearer tending
0	each in their several active spheres assigned 
0	till body up to spirit work in bounds
0	proportioned to each kind so from the root
0	springs lighter the green stalk from thence the leaves
0	more aery last the bright consummate flower
0	spirits odorous breathes flowers and their fruit 
0	man s nourishment by gradual scale sublimed 
0	to vital spirits aspire to animal 
0	to intellectual give both life and sense 
0	fancy and understanding whence the soul
0	reason receives and reason is her being 
0	discursive or intuitive discourse
0	is oftest yours the latter most is ours 
0	differing but in degree of kind the same 
0	wonder not then what god for you saw good
0	if i refuse not but convert as you
0	to proper substance time may come when men
0	with angels may participate and find
0	no inconvenient diet nor too light fare 
0	and from these corporal nutriments perhaps
0	your bodies may at last turn all to spirit 
0	improved by tract of time and winged ascend
0	ethereal as we or may at choice 
0	here or in heavenly paradises dwell 
0	if ye be found obedient and retain
0	unalterably firm his love entire 
0	whose progeny you are mean while enjoy
0	your fill what happiness this happy state
0	can comprehend incapable of more 
0	to whom the patriarch of mankind replied 
0	o favourable spirit propitious guest 
0	well hast thou taught the way that might direct
0	our knowledge and the scale of nature set
0	from center to circumference whereon 
0	in contemplation of created things 
0	by steps we may ascend to god but say 
0	what meant that caution joined if ye be found
0	obedient can we want obedience then
0	to him or possibly his love desert 
0	who formed us from the dust and placed us here
0	full to the utmost measure of what bliss
0	human desires can seek or apprehend 
0	to whom the angel son of heaven and earth 
0	attend that thou art happy owe to god 
0	that thou continuest such owe to thyself 
0	that is to thy obedience therein stand 
0	this was that caution given thee be advised 
0	god made thee perfect not immutable 
0	and good he made thee but to persevere
0	he left it in thy power ordained thy will
0	by nature free not over ruled by fate
0	inextricable or strict necessity 
0	our voluntary service he requires 
0	not our necessitated such with him
0	finds no acceptance nor can find for how
0	can hearts not free be tried whether they serve
0	willing or no who will but what they must
0	by destiny and can no other choose 
0	myself and all the angelick host that stand
0	in sight of god enthroned our happy state
0	hold as you yours while our obedience holds 
0	on other surety none freely we serve 
0	because we freely love as in our will
0	to love or not in this we stand or fall 
0	and some are fallen to disobedience fallen 
0	and so from heaven to deepest hell o fall
0	from what high state of bliss into what woe 
0	to whom our great progenitor thy words
0	attentive and with more delighted ear 
0	divine instructer i have heard than when
0	cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills
0	aereal musick send nor knew i not
0	to be both will and deed created free 
0	yet that we never shall forget to love
0	our maker and obey him whose command
0	single is yet so just my constant thoughts
0	assured me and still assure though what thou tellest
0	hath passed in heaven some doubt within me move 
0	but more desire to hear if thou consent 
0	the full relation which must needs be strange 
0	worthy of sacred silence to be heard 
0	and we have yet large day for scarce the sun
0	hath finished half his journey and scarce begins
0	his other half in the great zone of heaven 
0	thus adam made request and raphael 
0	after short pause assenting thus began 
0	high matter thou enjoinest me o prime of men 
0	sad task and hard for how shall i relate
0	to human sense the invisible exploits
0	of warring spirits how without remorse 
0	the ruin of so many glorious once
0	and perfect while they stood how last unfold
0	the secrets of another world perhaps
0	not lawful to reveal yet for thy good
0	this is dispensed and what surmounts the reach
0	of human sense i shall delineate so 
0	by likening spiritual to corporal forms 
0	as may express them best though what if earth
0	be but a shadow of heaven and things therein
0	each to other like more than on earth is thought 
0	as yet this world was not and chaos wild
0	reigned where these heavens now roll where earth now rests
0	upon her center poised when on a day
0	 for time though in eternity applied
0	to motion measures all things durable
0	by present past and future on such day
0	as heaven s great year brings forth the empyreal host
0	of angels by imperial summons called 
0	innumerable before the almighty s throne
0	forthwith from all the ends of heaven appeared
0	under their hierarchs in orders bright 
0	ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced 
0	standards and gonfalons twixt van and rear
0	stream in the air and for distinction serve
0	of hierarchies of orders and degrees 
0	or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed
0	holy memorials acts of zeal and love
0	recorded eminent thus when in orbs
0	of circuit inexpressible they stood 
0	orb within orb the father infinite 
0	by whom in bliss imbosomed sat the son 
0	amidst as from a flaming mount whose top
0	brightness had made invisible thus spake 
0	hear all ye angels progeny of light 
0	hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand 
0	this day i have begot whom i declare
0	my only son and on this holy hill
0	him have anointed whom ye now behold
0	at my right hand your head i him appoint 
0	and by myself have sworn to him shall bow
0	all knees in heaven and shall confess him lord 
0	under his great vice gerent reign abide
0	united as one individual soul 
0	for ever happy him who disobeys 
0	me disobeys breaks union and that day 
0	cast out from god and blessed vision falls
0	into utter darkness deep ingulfed his place
0	ordained without redemption without end 
0	so spake the omnipotent and with his words
0	all seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all 
0	that day as other solemn days they spent
0	in song and dance about the sacred hill 
0	mystical dance which yonder starry sphere
0	of planets and of fixed in all her wheels
0	resembles nearest mazes intricate 
0	eccentrick intervolved yet regular
0	then most when most irregular they seem 
0	and in their motions harmony divine
0	so smooths her charming tones that god s own ear
0	listens delighted evening now approached 
0	 for we have also our evening and our morn 
0	we ours for change delectable not need 
0	forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
0	desirous all in circles as they stood 
0	tables are set and on a sudden piled
0	with angels food and rubied nectar flows
0	in pearl in diamond and massy gold 
0	fruit of delicious vines the growth of heaven 
0	on flowers reposed and with fresh flowerets crowned 
0	they eat they drink and in communion sweet
0	quaff immortality and joy secure
0	of surfeit where full measure only bounds
0	excess before the all bounteous king who showered
0	with copious hand rejoicing in their joy 
0	now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled
0	from that high mount of god whence light and shade
0	spring both the face of brightest heaven had changed
0	to grateful twilight for night comes not there
0	in darker veil and roseate dews disposed
0	all but the unsleeping eyes of god to rest 
0	wide over all the plain and wider far
0	than all this globous earth in plain outspread 
0	 such are the courts of god the angelick throng 
0	dispersed in bands and files their camp extend
0	by living streams among the trees of life 
0	pavilions numberless and sudden reared 
0	celestial tabernacles where they slept
0	fanned with cool winds save those who in their course 
0	melodious hymns about the sovran throne
0	alternate all night long but not so waked
0	satan so call him now his former name
0	is heard no more in heaven he of the first 
0	if not the first arch angel great in power 
0	in favour and pre eminence yet fraught
0	with envy against the son of god that day
0	honoured by his great father and proclaimed
0	messiah king anointed could not bear
0	through pride that sight and thought himself impaired 
0	deep malice thence conceiving and disdain 
0	soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour
0	friendliest to sleep and silence he resolved
0	with all his legions to dislodge and leave
0	unworshipt unobeyed the throne supreme 
0	contemptuous and his next subordinate
0	awakening thus to him in secret spake 
0	sleepest thou companion dear what sleep can close
0	thy eye lids and rememberest what decree
0	of yesterday so late hath passed the lips
0	of heaven s almighty thou to me thy thoughts
0	wast wont i mine to thee was wont to impart 
0	both waking we were one how then can now
0	thy sleep dissent new laws thou seest imposed 
0	new laws from him who reigns new minds may raise
0	in us who serve new counsels to debate
0	what doubtful may ensue more in this place
0	to utter is not safe assemble thou
0	of all those myriads which we lead the chief 
0	tell them that by command ere yet dim night
0	her shadowy cloud withdraws i am to haste 
0	and all who under me their banners wave 
0	homeward with flying march where we possess
0	the quarters of the north there to prepare
0	fit entertainment to receive our king 
0	the great messiah and his new commands 
0	who speedily through all the hierarchies
0	intends to pass triumphant and give laws 
0	so spake the false arch angel and infused
0	bad influence into the unwary breast
0	of his associate he together calls 
0	or several one by one the regent powers 
0	under him regent tells as he was taught 
0	that the most high commanding now ere night 
0	now ere dim night had disincumbered heaven 
0	the great hierarchal standard was to move 
0	tells the suggested cause and casts between
0	ambiguous words and jealousies to sound
0	or taint integrity but all obeyed
0	the wonted signal and superiour voice
0	of their great potentate for great indeed
0	his name and high was his degree in heaven 
0	his countenance as the morning star that guides
0	the starry flock allured them and with lies
0	drew after him the third part of heaven s host 
0	mean while the eternal eye whose sight discerns
0	abstrusest thoughts from forth his holy mount 
0	and from within the golden lamps that burn
0	nightly before him saw without their light
0	rebellion rising saw in whom how spread
0	among the sons of morn what multitudes
0	were banded to oppose his high decree 
0	and smiling to his only son thus said 
0	son thou in whom my glory i behold
0	in full resplendence heir of all my might 
0	nearly it now concerns us to be sure
0	of our omnipotence and with what arms
0	we mean to hold what anciently we claim
0	of deity or empire such a foe
0	is rising who intends to erect his throne
0	equal to ours throughout the spacious north 
0	nor so content hath in his thought to try
0	in battle what our power is or our right 
0	let us advise and to this hazard draw
0	with speed what force is left and all employ
0	in our defence lest unawares we lose
0	this our high place our sanctuary our hill 
0	to whom the son with calm aspect and clear 
0	lightning divine ineffable serene 
0	made answer mighty father thou thy foes
0	justly hast in derision and secure 
0	laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain 
0	matter to me of glory whom their hate
0	illustrates when they see all regal power
0	given me to quell their pride and in event
0	know whether i be dextrous to subdue
0	thy rebels or be found the worst in heaven 
0	so spake the son but satan with his powers 
0	far was advanced on winged speed an host
0	innumerable as the stars of night 
0	or stars of morning dew drops which the sun
0	impearls on every leaf and every flower 
0	regions they passed the mighty regencies
0	in their triple degrees regions to which
0	all thy dominion adam is no more
0	than what this garden is to all the earth 
0	and all the sea from one entire globose
0	stretched into longitude which having passed 
0	at length into the limits of the north
0	they came and satan to his royal seat
0	high on a hill far blazing as a mount
0	raised on a mount with pyramids and towers
0	from diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold 
0	the palace of great lucifer so call
0	that structure in the dialect of men
0	interpreted which not long after he
0	affecting all equality with god 
0	in imitation of that mount whereon
0	messiah was declared in sight of heaven 
0	the mountain of the congregation called 
0	for thither he assembled all his train 
0	pretending so commanded to consult
0	about the great reception of their king 
0	thither to come and with calumnious art
0	of counterfeited truth thus held their ears 
0	if these magnifick titles yet remain
0	not merely titular since by decree
0	another now hath to himself engrossed
0	all power and us eclipsed under the name
0	of king anointed for whom all this haste
0	of midnight march and hurried meeting here 
0	this only to consult how we may best 
0	with what may be devised of honours new 
0	receive him coming to receive from us
0	knee tribute yet unpaid prostration vile 
0	too much to one but double how endured 
0	to one and to his image now proclaimed 
0	but what if better counsels might erect
0	our minds and teach us to cast off this yoke 
0	will ye submit your necks and choose to bend
0	the supple knee ye will not if i trust
0	to know ye right or if ye know yourselves
0	natives and sons of heaven possessed before
0	by none and if not equal all yet free 
0	equally free for orders and degrees
0	jar not with liberty but well consist 
0	who can in reason then or right assume
0	monarchy over such as live by right
0	his equals if in power and splendour less 
0	in freedom equal or can introduce
0	law and edict on us who without law
0	err not much less for this to be our lord 
0	and look for adoration to the abuse
0	of those imperial titles which assert
0	our being ordained to govern not to serve 
0	thus far his bold discourse without controul
0	had audience when among the seraphim
0	abdiel than whom none with more zeal adored
0	the deity and divine commands obeyed 
0	stood up and in a flame of zeal severe
0	the current of his fury thus opposed 
0	o argument blasphemous false and proud 
0	words which no ear ever to hear in heaven
0	expected least of all from thee ingrate 
0	in place thyself so high above thy peers 
0	canst thou with impious obloquy condemn
0	the just decree of god pronounced and sworn 
0	that to his only son by right endued
0	with regal scepter every soul in heaven
0	shall bend the knee and in that honour due
0	confess him rightful king unjust thou sayest 
0	flatly unjust to bind with laws the free 
0	and equal over equals to let reign 
0	one over all with unsucceeded power 
0	shalt thou give law to god shalt thou dispute
0	with him the points of liberty who made
0	thee what thou art and formed the powers of heaven
0	such as he pleased and circumscribed their being 
0	yet by experience taught we know how good 
0	and of our good and of our dignity
0	how provident he is how far from thought
0	to make us less bent rather to exalt
0	our happy state under one head more near
0	united but to grant it thee unjust 
0	that equal over equals monarch reign 
0	thyself though great and glorious dost thou count 
0	or all angelick nature joined in one 
0	equal to him begotten son by whom 
0	as by his word the mighty father made
0	all things even thee and all the spirits of heaven
0	by him created in their bright degrees 
0	crowned them with glory and to their glory named
0	essential powers nor by his reign obscured 
0	but more illustrious made since he the head
0	one of our number thus reduced becomes 
0	his laws our laws all honour to him done
0	returns our own cease then this impious rage 
0	and tempt not these but hasten to appease
0	the incensed father and the incensed son 
0	while pardon may be found in time besought 
0	so spake the fervent angel but his zeal
0	none seconded as out of season judged 
0	or singular and rash whereat rejoiced
0	the apostate and more haughty thus replied 
0	that we were formed then sayest thou and the work
0	of secondary hands by task transferred
0	from father to his son strange point and new 
0	doctrine which we would know whence learned who saw
0	when this creation was rememberest thou
0	thy making while the maker gave thee being 
0	we know no time when we were not as now 
0	know none before us self begot self raised
0	by our own quickening power when fatal course
0	had circled his full orb the birth mature
0	of this our native heaven ethereal sons 
0	our puissance is our own our own right hand
0	shall teach us highest deeds by proof to try
0	who is our equal then thou shalt behold
0	whether by supplication we intend
0	address and to begirt the almighty throne
0	beseeching or besieging this report 
0	these tidings carry to the anointed king 
0	and fly ere evil intercept thy flight 
0	he said and as the sound of waters deep 
0	hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause
0	through the infinite host nor less for that
0	the flaming seraph fearless though alone
0	encompassed round with foes thus answered bold 
0	o alienate from god o spirit accursed 
0	forsaken of all good i see thy fall
0	determined and thy hapless crew involved
0	in this perfidious fraud contagion spread
0	both of thy crime and punishment henceforth
0	no more be troubled how to quit the yoke
0	of god s messiah those indulgent laws
0	will not be now vouchsafed other decrees
0	against thee are gone forth without recall 
0	that golden scepter which thou didst reject 
0	is now an iron rod to bruise and break
0	thy disobedience well thou didst advise 
0	yet not for thy advice or threats i fly
0	these wicked tents devoted lest the wrath
0	impendent raging into sudden flame 
0	distinguish not for soon expect to feel
0	his thunder on thy head devouring fire 
0	then who created thee lamenting learn 
0	when who can uncreate thee thou shalt know 
0	so spake the seraph abdiel faithful found
0	among the faithless faithful only he 
0	among innumerable false unmoved 
0	unshaken unseduced unterrified 
0	his loyalty he kept his love his zeal 
0	nor number nor example with him wrought
0	to swerve from truth or change his constant mind 
0	though single from amidst them forth he passed 
0	long way through hostile scorn which he sustained
0	superiour nor of violence feared aught 
0	and with retorted scorn his back he turned
0	on those proud towers to swift destruction doomed 
0	all night the dreadless angel unpursued 
0	through heaven s wide champain held his way till morn 
0	waked by the circling hours with rosy hand
0	unbarred the gates of light there is a cave
0	within the mount of god fast by his throne 
0	where light and darkness in perpetual round
0	lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through heaven
0	grateful vicissitude like day and night 
0	light issues forth and at the other door
0	obsequious darkness enters till her hour
0	to veil the heaven though darkness there might well
0	seem twilight here and now went forth the morn
0	such as in highest heaven arrayed in gold
0	empyreal from before her vanished night 
0	shot through with orient beams when all the plain
0	covered with thick embattled squadrons bright 
0	chariots and flaming arms and fiery steeds 
0	reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view 
0	war he perceived war in procinct and found
0	already known what he for news had thought
0	to have reported gladly then he mixed
0	among those friendly powers who him received
0	with joy and acclamations loud that one 
0	that of so many myriads fallen yet one
0	returned not lost on to the sacred hill
0	they led him high applauded and present
0	before the seat supreme from whence a voice 
0	from midst a golden cloud thus mild was heard 
0	servant of god well done well hast thou fought
0	the better fight who single hast maintained
0	against revolted multitudes the cause
0	of truth in word mightier than they in arms 
0	and for the testimony of truth hast borne
0	universal reproach far worse to bear
0	than violence for this was all thy care
0	to stand approved in sight of god though worlds
0	judged thee perverse the easier conquest now
0	remains thee aided by this host of friends 
0	back on thy foes more glorious to return 
0	than scorned thou didst depart and to subdue
0	by force who reason for their law refuse 
0	right reason for their law and for their king
0	messiah who by right of merit reigns 
0	go michael of celestial armies prince 
0	and thou in military prowess next 
0	gabriel lead forth to battle these my sons
0	invincible lead forth my armed saints 
0	by thousands and by millions ranged for fight 
0	equal in number to that godless crew
0	rebellious them with fire and hostile arms
0	fearless assault and to the brow of heaven
0	pursuing drive them out from god and bliss 
0	into their place of punishment the gulf
0	of tartarus which ready opens wide
0	his fiery chaos to receive their fall 
0	so spake the sovran voice and clouds began
0	to darken all the hill and smoke to roll
0	in dusky wreaths reluctant flames the sign
0	of wrath awaked nor with less dread the loud
0	ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow 
0	at which command the powers militant 
0	that stood for heaven in mighty quadrate joined
0	of union irresistible moved on
0	in silence their bright legions to the sound
0	of instrumental harmony that breathed
0	heroick ardour to adventurous deeds
0	under their god like leaders in the cause
0	of god and his messiah on they move
0	indissolubly firm nor obvious hill 
0	nor straitening vale nor wood nor stream divides
0	their perfect ranks for high above the ground
0	their march was and the passive air upbore
0	their nimble tread as when the total kind
0	of birds in orderly array on wing 
0	came summoned over eden to receive
0	their names of thee so over many a tract
0	of heaven they marched and many a province wide 
0	tenfold the length of this terrene at last 
0	far in the horizon to the north appeared
0	from skirt to skirt a fiery region stretched
0	in battailous aspect and nearer view
0	bristled with upright beams innumerable
0	of rigid spears and helmets thronged and shields
0	various with boastful argument portrayed 
0	the banded powers of satan hasting on
0	with furious expedition for they weened
0	that self same day by fight or by surprise 
0	to win the mount of god and on his throne
0	to set the envier of his state the proud
0	aspirer but their thoughts proved fond and vain
0	in the mid way though strange to us it seemed
0	at first that angel should with angel war 
0	and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet
0	so oft in festivals of joy and love
0	unanimous as sons of one great sire 
0	hymning the eternal father but the shout
0	of battle now began and rushing sound
0	of onset ended soon each milder thought 
0	high in the midst exalted as a god 
0	the apostate in his sun bright chariot sat 
0	idol of majesty divine enclosed
0	with flaming cherubim and golden shields 
0	then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now
0	 twixt host and host but narrow space was left 
0	a dreadful interval and front to front
0	presented stood in terrible array
0	of hideous length before the cloudy van 
0	on the rough edge of battle ere it joined 
0	satan with vast and haughty strides advanced 
0	came towering armed in adamant and gold 
0	abdiel that sight endured not where he stood
0	among the mightiest bent on highest deeds 
0	and thus his own undaunted heart explores 
0	o heaven that such resemblance of the highest
0	should yet remain where faith and realty
0	remain not wherefore should not strength and might
0	there fail where virtue fails or weakest prove
0	where boldest though to fight unconquerable 
0	his puissance trusting in the almighty s aid 
0	i mean to try whose reason i have tried
0	unsound and false nor is it aught but just 
0	that he who in debate of truth hath won 
0	should win in arms in both disputes alike
0	victor though brutish that contest and foul 
0	when reason hath to deal with force yet so
0	most reason is that reason overcome 
0	so pondering and from his armed peers
0	forth stepping opposite half way he met
0	his daring foe at this prevention more
0	incensed and thus securely him defied 
0	proud art thou met thy hope was to have reached
0	the highth of thy aspiring unopposed 
0	the throne of god unguarded and his side
0	abandoned at the terrour of thy power
0	or potent tongue fool not to think how vain
0	against the omnipotent to rise in arms 
0	who out of smallest things could without end 
0	have raised incessant armies to defeat
0	thy folly or with solitary hand
0	reaching beyond all limit at one blow 
0	unaided could have finished thee and whelmed
0	thy legions under darkness but thou seest
0	all are not of thy train there be who faith
0	prefer and piety to god though then
0	to thee not visible when i alone
0	seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent
0	from all my sect thou seest now learn too late
0	how few sometimes may know when thousands err 
0	whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance 
0	thus answered ill for thee but in wished hour
0	of my revenge first sought for thou returnest
0	from flight seditious angel to receive
0	thy merited reward the first assay
0	of this right hand provoked since first that tongue 
0	inspired with contradiction durst oppose
0	a third part of the gods in synod met
0	their deities to assert who while they feel
0	vigour divine within them can allow
0	omnipotence to none but well thou comest
0	before thy fellows ambitious to win
0	from me some plume that thy success may show
0	destruction to the rest this pause between 
0	 unanswered lest thou boast to let thee know 
0	at first i thought that liberty and heaven
0	to heavenly souls had been all one but now
0	i see that most through sloth had rather serve 
0	ministring spirits trained up in feast and song 
0	such hast thou armed the minstrelsy of heaven 
0	servility with freedom to contend 
0	as both their deeds compared this day shall prove 
0	to whom in brief thus abdiel stern replied 
0	apostate still thou errest nor end wilt find
0	of erring from the path of truth remote 
0	unjustly thou depravest it with the name
0	of servitude to serve whom god ordains 
0	or nature god and nature bid the same 
0	when he who rules is worthiest and excels
0	them whom he governs this is servitude 
0	to serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled
0	against his worthier as thine now serve thee 
0	thyself not free but to thyself enthralled 
0	yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid 
0	reign thou in hell thy kingdom let me serve
0	in heaven god ever blest and his divine
0	behests obey worthiest to be obeyed 
0	yet chains in hell not realms expect mean while
0	from me returned as erst thou saidst from flight 
0	this greeting on thy impious crest receive 
0	so saying a noble stroke he lifted high 
0	which hung not but so swift with tempest fell
0	on the proud crest of satan that no sight 
0	nor motion of swift thought less could his shield 
0	such ruin intercept ten paces huge
0	he back recoiled the tenth on bended knee
0	his massy spear upstaid as if on earth
0	winds under ground or waters forcing way 
0	sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat 
0	half sunk with all his pines amazement seised
0	the rebel thrones but greater rage to see
0	thus foiled their mightiest ours joy filled and shout 
0	presage of victory and fierce desire
0	of battle whereat michael bid sound
0	the arch angel trumpet through the vast of heaven
0	it sounded and the faithful armies rung
0	hosanna to the highest nor stood at gaze
0	the adverse legions nor less hideous joined
0	the horrid shock now storming fury rose 
0	and clamour such as heard in heaven till now
0	was never arms on armour clashing brayed
0	horrible discord and the madding wheels
0	of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise
0	of conflict over head the dismal hiss
0	of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew 
0	and flying vaulted either host with fire 
0	so under fiery cope together rushed
0	both battles main with ruinous assault
0	and inextinguishable rage all heaven
0	resounded and had earth been then all earth
0	had to her center shook what wonder when
0	millions of fierce encountering angels fought
0	on either side the least of whom could wield
0	these elements and arm him with the force
0	of all their regions how much more of power
0	army against army numberless to raise
0	dreadful combustion warring and disturb 
0	though not destroy their happy native seat 
0	from his strong hold of heaven high over ruled
0	and limited their might though numbered such
0	as each divided legion might have seemed
0	a numerous host in strength each armed hand
0	a legion led in fight yet leader seemed
0	each warriour single as in chief expert
0	when to advance or stand or turn the sway
0	of battle open when and when to close
0	the ridges of grim war no thought of flight 
0	none of retreat no unbecoming deed
0	that argued fear each on himself relied 
0	as only in his arm the moment lay
0	of victory deeds of eternal fame
0	were done but infinite for wide was spread
0	that war and various sometimes on firm ground
0	a standing fight then soaring on main wing 
0	tormented all the air all air seemed then
0	conflicting fire long time in even scale
0	the battle hung till satan who that day
0	prodigious power had shown and met in arms
0	no equal ranging through the dire attack
0	of fighting seraphim confused at length
0	saw where the sword of michael smote and felled
0	squadrons at once with huge two handed sway
0	brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
0	wide wasting such destruction to withstand
0	he hasted and opposed the rocky orb
0	of tenfold adamant his ample shield 
0	a vast circumference at his approach
0	the great arch angel from his warlike toil
0	surceased and glad as hoping here to end
0	intestine war in heaven the arch foe subdued
0	or captive dragged in chains with hostile frown
0	and visage all inflamed first thus began 
0	author of evil unknown till thy revolt 
0	unnamed in heaven now plenteous as thou seest
0	these acts of hateful strife hateful to all 
0	though heaviest by just measure on thyself 
0	and thy adherents how hast thou disturbed
0	heaven s blessed peace and into nature brought
0	misery uncreated till the crime
0	of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled
0	thy malice into thousands once upright
0	and faithful now proved false but think not here
0	to trouble holy rest heaven casts thee out
0	from all her confines heaven the seat of bliss 
0	brooks not the works of violence and war 
0	hence then and evil go with thee along 
0	thy offspring to the place of evil hell 
0	thou and thy wicked crew there mingle broils 
0	ere this avenging sword begin thy doom 
0	or some more sudden vengeance winged from god 
0	precipitate thee with augmented pain 
0	so spake the prince of angels to whom thus
0	the adversary nor think thou with wind
0	of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds
0	thou canst not hast thou turned the least of these
0	to flight or if to fall but that they rise
0	unvanquished easier to transact with me
0	that thou shouldst hope imperious and with threats
0	to chase me hence err not that so shall end
0	the strife which thou callest evil but we style
0	the strife of glory which we mean to win 
0	or turn this heaven itself into the hell
0	thou fablest here however to dwell free 
0	if not to reign mean while thy utmost force 
0	and join him named almighty to thy aid 
0	i fly not but have sought thee far and nigh 
0	they ended parle and both addressed for fight
0	unspeakable for who though with the tongue
0	of angels can relate or to what things
0	liken on earth conspicuous that may lift
0	human imagination to such highth
0	of godlike power for likest gods they seemed 
0	stood they or moved in stature motion arms 
0	fit to decide the empire of great heaven 
0	now waved their fiery swords and in the air
0	made horrid circles two broad suns their shields
0	blazed opposite while expectation stood
0	in horrour from each hand with speed retired 
0	where erst was thickest fight the angelick throng 
0	and left large field unsafe within the wind
0	of such commotion such as to set forth
0	great things by small if nature s concord broke 
0	among the constellations war were sprung 
0	two planets rushing from aspect malign
0	of fiercest opposition in mid sky
0	should combat and their jarring spheres confound 
0	together both with next to almighty arm
0	up lifted imminent one stroke they aimed
0	that might determine and not need repeat 
0	as not of power at once nor odds appeared
0	in might or swift prevention but the sword
0	of michael from the armoury of god
0	was given him tempered so that neither keen
0	nor solid might resist that edge it met
0	the sword of satan with steep force to smite
0	descending and in half cut sheer nor staid 
0	but with swift wheel reverse deep entering shared
0	all his right side then satan first knew pain 
0	and writhed him to and fro convolved so sore
0	the griding sword with discontinuous wound
0	passed through him but the ethereal substance closed 
0	not long divisible and from the gash
0	a stream of necturous humour issuing flowed
0	sanguine such as celestial spirits may bleed 
0	and all his armour stained ere while so bright 
0	forthwith on all sides to his aid was run
0	by angels many and strong who interposed
0	defence while others bore him on their shields
0	back to his chariot where it stood retired
0	from off the files of war there they him laid
0	gnashing for anguish and despite and shame 
0	to find himself not matchless and his pride
0	humbled by such rebuke so far beneath
0	his confidence to equal god in power 
0	yet soon he healed for spirits that live throughout
0	vital in every part not as frail man
0	in entrails heart of head liver or reins 
0	cannot but by annihilating die 
0	nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
0	receive no more than can the fluid air 
0	all heart they live all head all eye all ear 
0	all intellect all sense and as they please 
0	they limb themselves and colour shape or size
0	assume as likes them best condense or rare 
0	mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
0	memorial where the might of gabriel fought 
0	and with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array
0	of moloch furious king who him defied 
0	and at his chariot wheels to drag him bound
0	threatened nor from the holy one of heaven
0	refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon
0	down cloven to the waist with shattered arms
0	and uncouth pain fled bellowing on each wing
0	uriel and raphael his vaunting foe 
0	though huge and in a rock of diamond armed 
0	two potent thrones that to be less than gods
0	disdained but meaner thoughts learned in their flight 
0	mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail 
0	nor stood unmindful abdiel to annoy
0	the atheist crew but with redoubled blow
0	ariel and arioch and the violence
0	of ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew 
0	i might relate of thousands and their names
0	eternize here on earth but those elect
0	angels contented with their fame in heaven 
0	seek not the praise of men the other sort 
0	in might though wonderous and in acts of war 
0	nor of renown less eager yet by doom
0	cancelled from heaven and sacred memory 
0	nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell 
0	for strength from truth divided and from just 
0	illaudable nought merits but dispraise
0	and ignominy yet to glory aspires
0	vain glorious and through infamy seeks fame 
0	therefore eternal silence be their doom 
0	and now their mightiest quelled the battle swerved 
0	with many an inroad gored deformed rout
0	entered and foul disorder all the ground
0	with shivered armour strown and on a heap
0	chariot and charioteer lay overturned 
0	and fiery foaming steeds what stood recoiled
0	o er wearied through the faint satanick host
0	defensive scarce or with pale fear surprised 
0	then first with fear surprised and sense of pain 
0	fled ignominious to such evil brought
0	by sin of disobedience till that hour
0	not liable to fear or flight or pain 
0	far otherwise the inviolable saints 
0	in cubick phalanx firm advanced entire 
0	invulnerable impenetrably armed 
0	such high advantages their innocence
0	gave them above their foes not to have sinned 
0	not to have disobeyed in fight they stood
0	unwearied unobnoxious to be pained
0	by wound though from their place by violence moved 
0	now night her course began and over heaven
0	inducing darkness grateful truce imposed 
0	and silence on the odious din of war 
0	under her cloudy covert both retired 
0	victor and vanquished on the foughten field
0	michael and his angels prevalent
0	encamping placed in guard their watches round 
0	cherubick waving fires on the other part 
0	satan with his rebellious disappeared 
0	far in the dark dislodged and void of rest 
0	his potentates to council called by night 
0	and in the midst thus undismayed began 
0	o now in danger tried now known in arms
0	not to be overpowered companions dear 
0	found worthy not of liberty alone 
0	too mean pretence but what we more affect 
0	honour dominion glory and renown 
0	who have sustained one day in doubtful fight 
0	 and if one day why not eternal days 
0	what heaven s lord had powerfullest to send
0	against us from about his throne and judged
0	sufficient to subdue us to his will 
0	but proves not so then fallible it seems 
0	of future we may deem him though till now
0	omniscient thought true is less firmly armed 
0	some disadvantage we endured and pain 
0	till now not known but known as soon contemned 
0	since now we find this our empyreal form
0	incapable of mortal injury 
0	imperishable and though pierced with wound 
0	soon closing and by native vigour healed 
0	of evil then so small as easy think
0	the remedy perhaps more valid arms 
0	weapons more violent when next we meet 
0	may serve to better us and worse our foes 
0	or equal what between us made the odds 
0	in nature none if other hidden cause
0	left them superiour while we can preserve
0	unhurt our minds and understanding sound 
0	due search and consultation will disclose 
0	he sat and in the assembly next upstood
0	nisroch of principalities the prime 
0	as one he stood escaped from cruel fight 
0	sore toiled his riven arms to havock hewn 
0	and cloudy in aspect thus answering spake 
0	deliverer from new lords leader to free
0	enjoyment of our right as gods yet hard
0	for gods and too unequal work we find 
0	against unequal arms to fight in pain 
0	against unpained impassive from which evil
0	ruin must needs ensue for what avails
0	valour or strength though matchless quelled with pain
0	which all subdues and makes remiss the hands
0	of mightiest sense of pleasure we may well
0	spare out of life perhaps and not repine 
0	but live content which is the calmest life 
0	but pain is perfect misery the worst
0	of evils and excessive overturns
0	all patience he who therefore can invent
0	with what more forcible we may offend
0	our yet unwounded enemies or arm
0	ourselves with like defence to me deserves
0	no less than for deliverance what we owe 
0	whereto with look composed satan replied 
0	not uninvented that which thou aright
0	believest so main to our success i bring 
0	which of us who beholds the bright surface
0	of this ethereous mould whereon we stand 
0	this continent of spacious heaven adorned
0	with plant fruit flower ambrosial gems and gold 
0	whose eye so superficially surveys
0	these things as not to mind from whence they grow
0	deep under ground materials dark and crude 
0	of spiritous and fiery spume till touched
0	with heaven s ray and tempered they shoot forth
0	so beauteous opening to the ambient light 
0	these in their dark nativity the deep
0	shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame 
0	which into hollow engines long and round 
0	thick rammed at the other bore with touch of fire
0	dilated and infuriate shall send forth
0	from far with thundering noise among our foes
0	such implements of mischief as shall dash
0	to pieces and o erwhelm whatever stands
0	adverse that they shall fear we have disarmed
0	the thunderer of his only dreaded bolt 
0	nor long shall be our labour yet ere dawn 
0	effect shall end our wish mean while revive 
0	abandon fear to strength and counsel joined
0	think nothing hard much less to be despaired 
0	he ended and his words their drooping cheer
0	enlightened and their languished hope revived 
0	the invention all admired and each how he
0	to be the inventer missed so easy it seemed
0	once found which yet unfound most would have thought
0	impossible yet haply of thy race
0	in future days if malice should abound 
0	some one intent on mischief or inspired
0	with devilish machination might devise
0	like instrument to plague the sons of men
0	for sin on war and mutual slaughter bent 
0	forthwith from council to the work they flew 
0	none arguing stood innumerable hands
0	were ready in a moment up they turned
0	wide the celestial soil and saw beneath
0	the originals of nature in their crude
0	conception sulphurous and nitrous foam
0	they found they mingled and with subtle art 
0	concocted and adusted they reduced
0	to blackest grain and into store conveyed 
0	part hidden veins digged up nor hath this earth
0	entrails unlike of mineral and stone 
0	whereof to found their engines and their balls
0	of missive ruin part incentive reed
0	provide pernicious with one touch to fire 
0	so all ere day spring under conscious night 
0	secret they finished and in order set 
0	with silent circumspection unespied 
0	now when fair morn orient in heaven appeared 
0	up rose the victor angels and to arms
0	the matin trumpet sung in arms they stood
0	of golden panoply refulgent host 
0	soon banded others from the dawning hills
0	look round and scouts each coast light armed scour 
0	each quarter to descry the distant foe 
0	where lodged or whither fled or if for fight 
0	in motion or in halt him soon they met
0	under spread ensigns moving nigh in slow
0	but firm battalion back with speediest sail
0	zophiel of cherubim the swiftest wing 
0	came flying and in mid air aloud thus cried 
0	arm warriours arm for fight the foe at hand 
0	whom fled we thought will save us long pursuit
0	this day fear not his flight so thick a cloud
0	he comes and settled in his face i see
0	sad resolution and secure let each
0	his adamantine coat gird well and each
0	fit well his helm gripe fast his orbed shield 
0	borne even or high for this day will pour down 
0	if i conjecture aught no drizzling shower 
0	but rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire 
0	so warned he them aware themselves and soon
0	in order quit of all impediment 
0	instant without disturb they took alarm 
0	and onward moved embattled when behold 
0	not distant far with heavy pace the foe
0	approaching gross and huge in hollow cube
0	training his devilish enginery impaled
0	on every side with shadowing squadrons deep 
0	to hide the fraud at interview both stood
0	a while but suddenly at head appeared
0	satan and thus was heard commanding loud 
0	vanguard to right and left the front unfold 
0	that all may see who hate us how we seek
0	peace and composure and with open breast
0	stand ready to receive them if they like
0	our overture and turn not back perverse 
0	but that i doubt however witness heaven 
0	heaven witness thou anon while we discharge
0	freely our part ye who appointed stand
0	do as you have in charge and briefly touch
0	what we propound and loud that all may hear 
0	so scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce
0	had ended when to right and left the front
0	divided and to either flank retired 
0	which to our eyes discovered new and strange 
0	a triple mounted row of pillars laid
0	on wheels for like to pillars most they seemed 
0	or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir 
0	with branches lopt in wood or mountain felled 
0	brass iron stony mould had not their mouths
0	with hideous orifice gaped on us wide 
0	portending hollow truce at each behind
0	a seraph stood and in his hand a reed
0	stood waving tipt with fire while we suspense 
0	collected stood within our thoughts amused 
0	not long for sudden all at once their reeds
0	put forth and to a narrow vent applied
0	with nicest touch immediate in a flame 
0	but soon obscured with smoke all heaven appeared 
0	from those deep throated engines belched whose roar
0	embowelled with outrageous noise the air 
0	and all her entrails tore disgorging foul
0	their devilish glut chained thunderbolts and hail
0	of iron globes which on the victor host
0	levelled with such impetuous fury smote 
0	that whom they hit none on their feet might stand 
0	though standing else as rocks but down they fell
0	by thousands angel on arch angel rolled 
0	the sooner for their arms unarmed they might
0	have easily as spirits evaded swift
0	by quick contraction or remove but now
0	foul dissipation followed and forced rout 
0	nor served it to relax their serried files 
0	what should they do if on they rushed repulse
0	repeated and indecent overthrow
0	doubled would render them yet more despised 
0	and to their foes a laughter for in view
0	stood ranked of seraphim another row 
0	in posture to displode their second tire
0	of thunder back defeated to return
0	they worse abhorred satan beheld their plight 
0	and to his mates thus in derision called 
0	o friends why come not on these victors proud
0	ere while they fierce were coming and when we 
0	to entertain them fair with open front
0	and breast what could we more propounded terms
0	of composition straight they changed their minds 
0	flew off and into strange vagaries fell 
0	as they would dance yet for a dance they seemed
0	somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps
0	for joy of offered peace but i suppose 
0	if our proposals once again were heard 
0	we should compel them to a quick result 
0	to whom thus belial in like gamesome mood 
0	leader the terms we sent were terms of weight 
0	of hard contents and full of force urged home 
0	such as we might perceive amused them all 
0	and stumbled many who receives them right 
0	had need from head to foot well understand 
0	not understood this gift they have besides 
0	they show us when our foes walk not upright 
0	so they among themselves in pleasant vein
0	stood scoffing hightened in their thoughts beyond
0	all doubt of victory eternal might
0	to match with their inventions they presumed
0	so easy and of his thunder made a scorn 
0	and all his host derided while they stood
0	a while in trouble but they stood not long 
0	rage prompted them at length and found them arms
0	against such hellish mischief fit to oppose 
0	forthwith behold the excellence the power 
0	which god hath in his mighty angels placed 
0	their arms away they threw and to the hills
0	 for earth hath this variety from heaven
0	of pleasure situate in hill and dale 
0	light as the lightning glimpse they ran they flew 
0	from their foundations loosening to and fro 
0	they plucked the seated hills with all their load 
0	rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops
0	up lifting bore them in their hands amaze 
0	be sure and terrour seized the rebel host 
0	when coming towards them so dread they saw
0	the bottom of the mountains upward turned 
0	till on those cursed engines triple row
0	they saw them whelmed and all their confidence
0	under the weight of mountains buried deep 
0	themselves invaded next and on their heads
0	main promontories flung which in the air
0	came shadowing and oppressed whole legions armed 
0	their armour helped their harm crushed in and bruised
0	into their substance pent which wrought them pain
0	implacable and many a dolorous groan 
0	long struggling underneath ere they could wind
0	out of such prison though spirits of purest light 
0	purest at first now gross by sinning grown 
0	the rest in imitation to like arms
0	betook them and the neighbouring hills uptore 
0	so hills amid the air encountered hills 
0	hurled to and fro with jaculation dire 
0	that under ground they fought in dismal shade 
0	infernal noise war seemed a civil game
0	to this uproar horrid confusion heaped
0	upon confusion rose and now all heaven
0	had gone to wrack with ruin overspread 
0	had not the almighty father where he sits
0	shrined in his sanctuary of heaven secure 
0	consulting on the sum of things foreseen
0	this tumult and permitted all advised 
0	that his great purpose he might so fulfil 
0	to honour his anointed son avenged
0	upon his enemies and to declare
0	all power on him transferred whence to his son 
0	the assessour of his throne he thus began 
0	effulgence of my glory son beloved 
0	son in whose face invisible is beheld
0	visibly what by deity i am 
0	and in whose hand what by decree i do 
0	second omnipotence two days are past 
0	two days as we compute the days of heaven 
0	since michael and his powers went forth to tame
0	these disobedient sore hath been their fight 
0	as likeliest was when two such foes met armed 
0	for to themselves i left them and thou knowest 
0	equal in their creation they were formed 
0	save what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought
0	insensibly for i suspend their doom 
0	whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
0	endless and no solution will be found 
0	war wearied hath performed what war can do 
0	and to disordered rage let loose the reins
0	with mountains as with weapons armed which makes
0	wild work in heaven and dangerous to the main 
0	two days are therefore past the third is thine 
0	for thee i have ordained it and thus far
0	have suffered that the glory may be thine
0	of ending this great war since none but thou
0	can end it into thee such virtue and grace
0	immense i have transfused that all may know
0	in heaven and hell thy power above compare 
0	and this perverse commotion governed thus 
0	to manifest thee worthiest to be heir
0	of all things to be heir and to be king
0	by sacred unction thy deserved right 
0	go then thou mightiest in thy father s might 
0	ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels
0	that shake heaven s basis bring forth all my war 
0	my bow and thunder my almighty arms
0	gird on and sword upon thy puissant thigh 
0	pursue these sons of darkness drive them out
0	from all heaven s bounds into the utter deep 
0	there let them learn as likes them to despise
0	god and messiah his anointed king 
0	he said and on his son with rays direct
0	shone full he all his father full expressed
0	ineffably into his face received 
0	and thus the filial godhead answering spake 
0	o father o supreme of heavenly thrones 
0	first highest holiest best thou always seek st
0	to glorify thy son i always thee 
0	as is most just this i my glory account 
0	my exaltation and my whole delight 
0	that thou in me well pleased declarest thy will
0	fulfilled which to fulfil is all my bliss 
0	scepter and power thy giving i assume 
0	and gladlier shall resign when in the end
0	thou shalt be all in all and i in thee
0	for ever and in me all whom thou lovest 
0	but whom thou hatest i hate and can put on
0	thy terrours as i put thy mildness on 
0	image of thee in all things and shall soon 
0	armed with thy might rid heaven of these rebelled 
0	to their prepared ill mansion driven down 
0	to chains of darkness and the undying worm 
0	that from thy just obedience could revolt 
0	whom to obey is happiness entire 
0	then shall thy saints unmixed and from the impure
0	far separate circling thy holy mount 
0	unfeigned halleluiahs to thee sing 
0	hymns of high praise and i among them chief 
0	so said he o er his scepter bowing rose
0	from the right hand of glory where he sat 
0	and the third sacred morn began to shine 
0	dawning through heaven forth rushed with whirlwind sound
0	the chariot of paternal deity 
0	flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn 
0	itself instinct with spirit but convoyed
0	by four cherubick shapes four faces each
0	had wonderous as with stars their bodies all
0	and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels
0	of beryl and careering fires between 
0	over their heads a crystal firmament 
0	whereon a sapphire throne inlaid with pure
0	amber and colours of the showery arch 
0	he in celestial panoply all armed
0	of radiant urim work divinely wrought 
0	ascended at his right hand victory
0	sat eagle winged beside him hung his bow
0	and quiver with three bolted thunder stored 
0	and from about him fierce effusion rolled
0	of smoke and bickering flame and sparkles dire 
0	attended with ten thousand thousand saints 
0	he onward came far off his coming shone 
0	and twenty thousand i their number heard 
0	chariots of god half on each hand were seen 
0	he on the wings of cherub rode sublime
0	on the crystalline sky in sapphire throned 
0	illustrious far and wide but by his own
0	first seen them unexpected joy surprised 
0	when the great ensign of messiah blazed
0	aloft by angels borne his sign in heaven 
0	under whose conduct michael soon reduced
0	his army circumfused on either wing 
0	under their head imbodied all in one 
0	before him power divine his way prepared 
0	at his command the uprooted hills retired
0	each to his place they heard his voice and went
0	obsequious heaven his wonted face renewed 
0	and with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled 
0	this saw his hapless foes but stood obdured 
0	and to rebellious fight rallied their powers 
0	insensate hope conceiving from despair 
0	in heavenly spirits could such perverseness dwell 
0	but to convince the proud what signs avail 
0	or wonders move the obdurate to relent 
0	they hardened more by what might most reclaim 
0	grieving to see his glory at the sight
0	took envy and aspiring to his highth 
0	stood re embattled fierce by force or fraud
0	weening to prosper and at length prevail
0	against god and messiah or to fall
0	in universal ruin last and now
0	to final battle drew disdaining flight 
0	or faint retreat when the great son of god
0	to all his host on either hand thus spake 
0	stand still in bright array ye saints here stand 
0	ye angels armed this day from battle rest 
0	faithful hath been your warfare and of god
0	accepted fearless in his righteous cause 
0	and as ye have received so have ye done 
0	invincibly but of this cursed crew
0	the punishment to other hand belongs 
0	vengeance is his or whose he sole appoints 
0	number to this day s work is not ordained 
0	nor multitude stand only and behold
0	god s indignation on these godless poured
0	by me not you but me they have despised 
0	yet envied against me is all their rage 
0	because the father to whom in heaven s preme
0	kingdom and power and glory appertains 
0	hath honoured me according to his will 
0	therefore to me their doom he hath assigned 
0	that they may have their wish to try with me
0	in battle which the stronger proves they all 
0	or i alone against them since by strength
0	they measure all of other excellence
0	not emulous nor care who them excels 
0	nor other strife with them do i vouchsafe 
0	so spake the son and into terrour changed
0	his countenance too severe to be beheld 
0	and full of wrath bent on his enemies 
0	at once the four spread out their starry wings
0	with dreadful shade contiguous and the orbs
0	of his fierce chariot rolled as with the sound
0	of torrent floods or of a numerous host 
0	he on his impious foes right onward drove 
0	gloomy as night under his burning wheels
0	the stedfast empyrean shook throughout 
0	all but the throne itself of god full soon
0	among them he arrived in his right hand
0	grasping ten thousand thunders which he sent
0	before him such as in their souls infixed
0	plagues they astonished all resistance lost 
0	all courage down their idle weapons dropt 
0	o er shields and helms and helmed heads he rode
0	of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate 
0	that wished the mountains now might be again
0	thrown on them as a shelter from his ire 
0	nor less on either side tempestuous fell
0	his arrows from the fourfold visaged four
0	distinct with eyes and from the living wheels
0	distinct alike with multitude of eyes 
0	one spirit in them ruled and every eye
0	glared lightning and shot forth pernicious fire
0	among the accursed that withered all their strength 
0	and of their wonted vigour left them drained 
0	exhausted spiritless afflicted fallen 
0	yet half his strength he put not forth but checked
0	his thunder in mid volley for he meant
0	not to destroy but root them out of heaven 
0	the overthrown he raised and as a herd
0	of goats or timorous flock together thronged
0	drove them before him thunder struck pursued
0	with terrours and with furies to the bounds
0	and crystal wall of heaven which opening wide 
0	rolled inward and a spacious gap disclosed
0	into the wasteful deep the monstrous sight
0	struck them with horrour backward but far worse
0	urged them behind headlong themselves they threw
0	down from the verge of heaven eternal wrath
0	burnt after them to the bottomless pit 
0	hell heard the unsufferable noise hell saw
0	heaven ruining from heaven and would have fled
0	affrighted but strict fate had cast too deep
0	her dark foundations and too fast had bound 
0	nine days they fell confounded chaos roared 
0	and felt tenfold confusion in their fall
0	through his wild anarchy so huge a rout
0	incumbered him with ruin hell at last
0	yawning received them whole and on them closed 
0	hell their fit habitation fraught with fire
0	unquenchable the house of woe and pain 
0	disburdened heaven rejoiced and soon repaired
0	her mural breach returning whence it rolled 
0	sole victor from the expulsion of his foes 
0	messiah his triumphal chariot turned 
0	to meet him all his saints who silent stood
0	eye witnesses of his almighty acts 
0	with jubilee advanced and as they went 
0	shaded with branching palm each order bright 
0	sung triumph and him sung victorious king 
0	son heir and lord to him dominion given 
0	worthiest to reign he celebrated rode
0	triumphant through mid heaven into the courts
0	and temple of his mighty father throned
0	on high who into glory him received 
0	where now he sits at the right hand of bliss 
0	thus measuring things in heaven by things on earth 
0	at thy request and that thou mayest beware
0	by what is past to thee i have revealed
0	what might have else to human race been hid 
0	the discord which befel and war in heaven
0	among the angelick powers and the deep fall
0	of those too high aspiring who rebelled
0	with satan he who envies now thy state 
0	who now is plotting how he may seduce
0	thee also from obedience that with him
0	bereaved of happiness thou mayest partake
0	his punishment eternal misery 
0	which would be all his solace and revenge 
0	as a despite done against the most high 
0	thee once to gain companion of his woe 
0	but listen not to his temptations warn
0	thy weaker let it profit thee to have heard 
0	by terrible example the reward
0	of disobedience firm they might have stood 
0	yet fell remember and fear to transgress 
0	descend from heaven urania by that name
0	if rightly thou art called whose voice divine
0	following above the olympian hill i soar 
0	above the flight of pegasean wing 
0	the meaning not the name i call for thou
0	nor of the muses nine nor on the top
0	of old olympus dwellest but heavenly born 
0	before the hills appeared or fountain flowed 
0	thou with eternal wisdom didst converse 
0	wisdom thy sister and with her didst play
0	in presence of the almighty father pleased
0	with thy celestial song up led by thee
0	into the heaven of heavens i have presumed 
0	an earthly guest and drawn empyreal air 
0	thy tempering with like safety guided down
0	return me to my native element 
0	lest from this flying steed unreined as once
0	bellerophon though from a lower clime 
0	dismounted on the aleian field i fall 
0	erroneous there to wander and forlorn 
0	half yet remains unsung but narrower bound
0	within the visible diurnal sphere 
0	standing on earth not rapt above the pole 
0	more safe i sing with mortal voice unchanged
0	to hoarse or mute though fallen on evil days 
0	on evil days though fallen and evil tongues 
0	in darkness and with dangers compassed round 
0	and solitude yet not alone while thou
0	visitest my slumbers nightly or when morn
0	purples the east still govern thou my song 
0	urania and fit audience find though few 
0	but drive far off the barbarous dissonance
0	of bacchus and his revellers the race
0	of that wild rout that tore the thracian bard
0	in rhodope where woods and rocks had ears
0	to rapture till the savage clamour drowned
0	both harp and voice nor could the muse defend
0	her son so fail not thou who thee implores 
0	for thou art heavenly she an empty dream 
0	say goddess what ensued when raphael 
0	the affable arch angel had forewarned
0	adam by dire example to beware
0	apostasy by what befel in heaven
0	to those apostates lest the like befall
0	in paradise to adam or his race 
0	charged not to touch the interdicted tree 
0	if they transgress and slight that sole command 
0	so easily obeyed amid the choice
0	of all tastes else to please their appetite 
0	though wandering he with his consorted eve 
0	the story heard attentive and was filled
0	with admiration and deep muse to hear
0	of things so high and strange things to their thought
0	so unimaginable as hate in heaven 
0	and war so near the peace of god in bliss 
0	with such confusion but the evil soon
0	driven back redounded as a flood on those
0	from whom it sprung impossible to mix
0	with blessedness whence adam soon repealed
0	the doubts that in his heart arose and now
0	led on yet sinless with desire to know
0	what nearer might concern him how this world
0	of heaven and earth conspicuous first began 
0	when and whereof created for what cause 
0	what within eden or without was done
0	before his memory as one whose drouth
0	yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream 
0	whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites 
0	proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest 
0	great things and full of wonder in our ears 
0	far differing from this world thou hast revealed 
0	divine interpreter by favour sent
0	down from the empyrean to forewarn
0	us timely of what might else have been our loss 
0	unknown which human knowledge could not reach 
0	for which to the infinitely good we owe
0	immortal thanks and his admonishment
0	receive with solemn purpose to observe
0	immutably his sovran will the end
0	of what we are but since thou hast vouchsafed
0	gently for our instruction to impart
0	things above earthly thought which yet concerned
0	our knowing as to highest wisdom seemed 
0	deign to descend now lower and relate
0	what may no less perhaps avail us known 
0	how first began this heaven which we behold
0	distant so high with moving fires adorned
0	innumerable and this which yields or fills
0	all space the ambient air wide interfused
0	embracing round this floried earth what cause
0	moved the creator in his holy rest
0	through all eternity so late to build
0	in chaos and the work begun how soon
0	absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold
0	what we not to explore the secrets ask
0	of his eternal empire but the more
0	to magnify his works the more we know 
0	and the great light of day yet wants to run
0	much of his race though steep suspense in heaven 
0	held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears 
0	and longer will delay to hear thee tell
0	his generation and the rising birth
0	of nature from the unapparent deep 
0	or if the star of evening and the moon
0	haste to thy audience night with her will bring 
0	silence and sleep listening to thee will watch 
0	or we can bid his absence till thy song
0	end and dismiss thee ere the morning shine 
0	thus adam his illustrious guest besought 
0	and thus the godlike angel answered mild 
0	this also thy request with caution asked 
0	obtain though to recount almighty works
0	what words or tongue of seraph can suffice 
0	or heart of man suffice to comprehend 
0	yet what thou canst attain which best may serve
0	to glorify the maker and infer
0	thee also happier shall not be withheld
0	thy hearing such commission from above
0	i have received to answer thy desire
0	of knowledge within bounds beyond abstain
0	to ask nor let thine own inventions hope
0	things not revealed which the invisible king 
0	only omniscient hath suppressed in night 
0	to none communicable in earth or heaven 
0	enough is left besides to search and know 
0	but knowledge is as food and needs no less
0	her temperance over appetite to know
0	in measure what the mind may well contain 
0	oppresses else with surfeit and soon turns
0	wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind 
0	know then that after lucifer from heaven
0	 so call him brighter once amidst the host
0	of angels than that star the stars among 
0	fell with his flaming legions through the deep
0	into his place and the great son returned
0	victorious with his saints the omnipotent
0	eternal father from his throne beheld
0	their multitude and to his son thus spake 
0	at least our envious foe hath failed who thought
0	all like himself rebellious by whose aid
0	this inaccessible high strength the seat
0	of deity supreme us dispossessed 
0	he trusted to have seised and into fraud
0	drew many whom their place knows here no more 
0	yet far the greater part have kept i see 
0	their station heaven yet populous retains
0	number sufficient to possess her realms
0	though wide and this high temple to frequent
0	with ministeries due and solemn rites 
0	but lest his heart exalt him in the harm
0	already done to have dispeopled heaven 
0	my damage fondly deemed i can repair
0	that detriment if such it be to lose
0	self lost and in a moment will create
0	another world out of one man a race
0	of men innumerable there to dwell 
0	not here till by degrees of merit raised 
0	they open to themselves at length the way
0	up hither under long obedience tried 
0	and earth be changed to heaven and heaven to earth 
0	one kingdom joy and union without end 
0	mean while inhabit lax ye powers of heaven 
0	and thou my word begotten son by thee
0	this i perform speak thou and be it done 
0	my overshadowing spirit and might with thee
0	i send along ride forth and bid the deep
0	within appointed bounds be heaven and earth 
0	boundless the deep because i am who fill
0	infinitude nor vacuous the space 
0	though i uncircumscribed myself retire 
0	and put not forth my goodness which is free
0	to act or not necessity and chance
0	approach not me and what i will is fate 
0	so spake the almighty and to what he spake
0	his word the filial godhead gave effect 
0	immediate are the acts of god more swift
0	than time or motion but to human ears
0	cannot without process of speech be told 
0	so told as earthly notion can receive 
0	great triumph and rejoicing was in heaven 
0	when such was heard declared the almighty s will 
0	glory they sung to the most high good will
0	to future men and in their dwellings peace 
0	glory to him whose just avenging ire
0	had driven out the ungodly from his sight
0	and the habitations of the just to him
0	glory and praise whose wisdom had ordained
0	good out of evil to create instead
0	of spirits malign a better race to bring
0	into their vacant room and thence diffuse
0	his good to worlds and ages infinite 
0	so sang the hierarchies mean while the son
0	on his great expedition now appeared 
0	girt with omnipotence with radiance crowned
0	of majesty divine sapience and love
0	immense and all his father in him shone 
0	about his chariot numberless were poured
0	and virtues winged spirits and chariots winged
0	from the armoury of god where stand of old
0	myriads between two brazen mountains lodged
0	against a solemn day harnessed at hand 
0	celestial equipage and now came forth
0	spontaneous for within them spirit lived 
0	attendant on their lord heaven opened wide
0	her ever during gates harmonious sound
0	on golden hinges moving to let forth
0	the king of glory in his powerful word
0	and spirit coming to create new worlds 
0	on heavenly ground they stood and from the shore
0	they viewed the vast immeasurable abyss
0	outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild 
0	up from the bottom turned by furious winds
0	and surging waves as mountains to assault
0	heaven s highth and with the center mix the pole 
0	silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace 
0	said then the omnifick word your discord end 
0	nor staid but on the wings of cherubim
0	uplifted in paternal glory rode
0	far into chaos and the world unborn 
0	for chaos heard his voice him all his train
0	followed in bright procession to behold
0	creation and the wonders of his might 
0	then staid the fervid wheels and in his hand
0	he took the golden compasses prepared
0	in god s eternal store to circumscribe
0	this universe and all created things 
0	one foot he centered and the other turned
0	round through the vast profundity obscure 
0	and said thus far extend thus far thy bounds 
0	this be thy just circumference o world 
0	thus god the heaven created thus the earth 
0	matter unformed and void darkness profound
0	covered the abyss but on the watery calm
0	his brooding wings the spirit of god outspread 
0	and vital virtue infused and vital warmth
0	throughout the fluid mass but downward purged
0	the black tartareous cold infernal dregs 
0	adverse to life then founded then conglobed
0	like things to like the rest to several place
0	disparted and between spun out the air 
0	and earth self balanced on her center hung 
0	let there be light said god and forthwith light
0	ethereal first of things quintessence pure 
0	sprung from the deep and from her native east
0	to journey through the aery gloom began 
0	sphered in a radiant cloud for yet the sun
0	was not she in a cloudy tabernacle
0	sojourned the while god saw the light was good 
0	and light from darkness by the hemisphere
0	divided light the day and darkness night 
0	he named thus was the first day even and morn 
0	nor past uncelebrated nor unsung
0	by the celestial quires when orient light
0	exhaling first from darkness they beheld 
0	birth day of heaven and earth with joy and shout
0	the hollow universal orb they filled 
0	and touched their golden harps and hymning praised
0	god and his works creator him they sung 
0	both when first evening was and when first morn 
0	again god said let there be firmament
0	amid the waters and let it divide
0	the waters from the waters and god made
0	the firmament expanse of liquid pure 
0	transparent elemental air diffused
0	in circuit to the uttermost convex
0	of this great round partition firm and sure 
0	the waters underneath from those above
0	dividing for as earth so he the world
0	built on circumfluous waters calm in wide
0	crystalline ocean and the loud misrule
0	of chaos far removed lest fierce extremes
0	contiguous might distemper the whole frame 
0	and heaven he named the firmament so even
0	and morning chorus sung the second day 
0	the earth was formed but in the womb as yet
0	of waters embryon immature involved 
0	appeared not over all the face of earth
0	main ocean flowed not idle but with warm
0	prolifick humour softening all her globe 
0	fermented the great mother to conceive 
0	satiate with genial moisture when god said 
0	be gathered now ye waters under heaven
0	into one place and let dry land appear 
0	immediately the mountains huge appear
0	emergent and their broad bare backs upheave
0	into the clouds their tops ascend the sky 
0	so high as heaved the tumid hills so low
0	down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep 
0	capacious bed of waters thither they
0	hasted with glad precipitance uprolled 
0	as drops on dust conglobing from the dry 
0	part rise in crystal wall or ridge direct 
0	for haste such flight the great command impressed
0	on the swift floods as armies at the call
0	of trumpet for of armies thou hast heard 
0	troop to their standard so the watery throng 
0	wave rolling after wave where way they found 
0	if steep with torrent rapture if through plain 
0	soft ebbing nor withstood them rock or hill 
0	but they or under ground or circuit wide
0	with serpent errour wandering found their way 
0	and on the washy oose deep channels wore 
0	easy ere god had bid the ground be dry 
0	all but within those banks where rivers now
0	stream and perpetual draw their humid train 
0	the dry land earth and the great receptacle
0	of congregated waters he called seas 
0	and saw that it was good and said let the earth
0	put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed 
0	and fruit tree yielding fruit after her kind 
0	whose seed is in herself upon the earth 
0	he scarce had said when the bare earth till then
0	desart and bare unsightly unadorned 
0	brought forth the tender grass whose verdure clad
0	her universal face with pleasant green 
0	then herbs of every leaf that sudden flowered
0	opening their various colours and made gay
0	her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown 
0	forth flourished thick the clustering vine forth crept
0	the swelling gourd up stood the corny reed
0	embattled in her field and the humble shrub 
0	and bush with frizzled hair implicit last
0	rose as in dance the stately trees and spread
0	their branches hung with copious fruit or gemmed
0	their blossoms with high woods the hills were crowned 
0	with tufts the valleys and each fountain side 
0	with borders long the rivers that earth now
0	seemed like to heaven a seat where gods might dwell 
0	or wander with delight and love to haunt
0	her sacred shades though god had yet not rained
0	upon the earth and man to till the ground
0	none was but from the earth a dewy mist
0	went up and watered all the ground and each
0	plant of the field which ere it was in the earth 
0	god made and every herb before it grew
0	on the green stem god saw that it was good 
0	so even and morn recorded the third day 
0	again the almighty spake let there be lights
0	high in the expanse of heaven to divide
0	the day from night and let them be for signs 
0	for seasons and for days and circling years 
0	and let them be for lights as i ordain
0	their office in the firmament of heaven 
0	to give light on the earth and it was so 
0	and god made two great lights great for their use
0	to man the greater to have rule by day 
0	the less by night altern and made the stars 
0	and set them in the firmament of heaven
0	to illuminate the earth and rule the day
0	in their vicissitude and rule the night 
0	and light from darkness to divide god saw 
0	surveying his great work that it was good 
0	for of celestial bodies first the sun
0	a mighty sphere he framed unlightsome first 
0	though of ethereal mould then formed the moon
0	globose and every magnitude of stars 
0	and sowed with stars the heaven thick as a field 
0	of light by far the greater part he took 
0	transplanted from her cloudy shrine and placed
0	in the sun s orb made porous to receive
0	and drink the liquid light firm to retain
0	her gathered beams great palace now of light 
0	hither as to their fountain other stars
0	repairing in their golden urns draw light 
0	and hence the morning planet gilds her horns 
0	by tincture or reflection they augment
0	their small peculiar though from human sight
0	so far remote with diminution seen 
0	first in his east the glorious lamp was seen 
0	regent of day and all the horizon round
0	invested with bright rays jocund to run
0	his longitude through heaven s high road the gray
0	dawn and the pleiades before him danced 
0	shedding sweet influence less bright the moon 
0	but opposite in levelled west was set 
0	his mirrour with full face borrowing her light
0	from him for other light she needed none
0	in that aspect and still that distance keeps
0	till night then in the east her turn she shines 
0	revolved on heaven s great axle and her reign
0	with thousand lesser lights dividual holds 
0	with thousand thousand stars that then appeared
0	spangling the hemisphere then first adorned
0	with their bright luminaries that set and rose 
0	glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day 
0	and god said let the waters generate
0	reptile with spawn abundant living soul 
0	and let fowl fly above the earth with wings
0	displayed on the open firmament of heaven 
0	and god created the great whales and each
0	soul living each that crept which plenteously
0	the waters generated by their kinds 
0	and every bird of wing after his kind 
0	and saw that it was good and blessed them saying 
0	be fruitful multiply and in the seas 
0	and lakes and running streams the waters fill 
0	and let the fowl be multiplied on the earth 
0	forthwith the sounds and seas each creek and bay 
0	with fry innumerable swarm and shoals
0	of fish that with their fins and shining scales 
0	glide under the green wave in sculls that oft
0	bank the mid sea part single or with mate 
0	graze the sea weed their pasture and through groves
0	of coral stray or sporting with quick glance 
0	show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold 
0	or in their pearly shells at ease attend
0	moist nutriment or under rocks their food
0	in jointed armour watch on smooth the seal
0	and bended dolphins play part huge of bulk
0	wallowing unwieldy enormous in their gait 
0	tempest the ocean there leviathan 
0	hugest of living creatures on the deep
0	stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims 
0	and seems a moving land and at his gills
0	draws in and at his trunk spouts out a sea 
0	mean while the tepid caves and fens and shores 
0	their brood as numerous hatch from the egg that soon
0	bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
0	their callow young but feathered soon and fledge
0	they summed their pens and soaring the air sublime 
0	with clang despised the ground under a cloud
0	in prospect there the eagle and the stork
0	on cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build 
0	part loosely wing the region part more wise
0	in common ranged in figure wedge their way 
0	intelligent of seasons and set forth
0	their aery caravan high over seas
0	flying and over lands with mutual wing
0	easing their flight so steers the prudent crane
0	her annual voyage borne on winds the air
0	floats as they pass fanned with unnumbered plumes 
0	from branch to branch the smaller birds with song
0	solaced the woods and spread their painted wings
0	till even nor then the solemn nightingale
0	ceased warbling but all night tun d her soft lays 
0	others on silver lakes and rivers bathed
0	their downy breast the swan with arched neck 
0	between her white wings mantling proudly rows
0	her state with oary feet yet oft they quit
0	the dank and rising on stiff pennons tower
0	the mid aereal sky others on ground
0	walked firm the crested cock whose clarion sounds
0	the silent hours and the other whose gay train
0	adorns him coloured with the florid hue
0	of rainbows and starry eyes the waters thus
0	with fish replenished and the air with fowl 
0	evening and morn solemnized the fifth day 
0	the sixth and of creation last arose
0	with evening harps and matin when god said 
0	let the earth bring forth soul living in her kind 
0	cattle and creeping things and beast of the earth 
0	each in their kind the earth obeyed and straight
0	opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth
0	innumerous living creatures perfect forms 
0	limbed and full grown out of the ground up rose 
0	as from his lair the wild beast where he wons
0	in forest wild in thicket brake or den 
0	among the trees in pairs they rose they walked 
0	the cattle in the fields and meadows green 
0	those rare and solitary these in flocks
0	pasturing at once and in broad herds upsprung 
0	the grassy clods now calved now half appeared
0	the tawny lion pawing to get free
0	his hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds 
0	and rampant shakes his brinded mane the ounce 
0	the libbard and the tiger as the mole
0	rising the crumbled earth above them threw
0	in hillocks the swift stag from under ground
0	bore up his branching head scarce from his mould
0	behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved
0	his vastness fleeced the flocks and bleating rose 
0	as plants ambiguous between sea and land
0	the river horse and scaly crocodile 
0	at once came forth whatever creeps the ground 
0	insect or worm those waved their limber fans
0	for wings and smallest lineaments exact
0	in all the liveries decked of summer s pride
0	with spots of gold and purple azure and green 
0	these as a line their long dimension drew 
0	streaking the ground with sinuous trace not all
0	minims of nature some of serpent kind 
0	wonderous in length and corpulence involved
0	their snaky folds and added wings first crept
0	the parsimonious emmet provident
0	of future in small room large heart enclosed 
0	pattern of just equality perhaps
0	hereafter joined in her popular tribes
0	of commonalty swarming next appeared
0	the female bee that feeds her husband drone
0	deliciously and builds her waxen cells
0	with honey stored the rest are numberless 
0	and thou their natures knowest and gavest them names 
0	needless to thee repeated nor unknown
0	the serpent subtlest beast of all the field 
0	of huge extent sometimes with brazen eyes
0	and hairy mane terrifick though to thee
0	not noxious but obedient at thy call 
0	now heaven in all her glory shone and rolled
0	her motions as the great first mover s hand
0	first wheeled their course earth in her rich attire
0	consummate lovely smiled air water earth 
0	by fowl fish beast was flown was swum was walked 
0	frequent and of the sixth day yet remained 
0	there wanted yet the master work the end
0	of all yet done a creature who not prone
0	and brute as other creatures but endued
0	with sanctity of reason might erect
0	his stature and upright with front serene
0	govern the rest self knowing and from thence
0	magnanimous to correspond with heaven 
0	but grateful to acknowledge whence his good
0	descends thither with heart and voice and eyes
0	directed in devotion to adore
0	and worship god supreme who made him chief
0	of all his works therefore the omnipotent
0	eternal father for where is not he
0	present thus to his son audibly spake 
0	let us make now man in our image man
0	in our similitude and let them rule
0	over the fish and fowl of sea and air 
0	beast of the field and over all the earth 
0	and every creeping thing that creeps the ground 
0	this said he formed thee adam thee o man 
0	dust of the ground and in thy nostrils breathed
0	the breath of life in his own image he
0	created thee in the image of god
0	express and thou becamest a living soul 
0	male he created thee but thy consort
0	female for race then blessed mankind and said 
0	be fruitful multiply and fill the earth 
0	subdue it and throughout dominion hold
0	over fish of the sea and fowl of the air 
0	and every living thing that moves on the earth 
0	wherever thus created for no place
0	is yet distinct by name thence as thou knowest 
0	he brought thee into this delicious grove 
0	this garden planted with the trees of god 
0	delectable both to behold and taste 
0	and freely all their pleasant fruit for food
0	gave thee all sorts are here that all the earth yields 
0	variety without end but of the tree 
0	which tasted works knowledge of good and evil 
0	thou mayest not in the day thou eatest thou diest 
0	death is the penalty imposed beware 
0	and govern well thy appetite lest sin
0	surprise thee and her black attendant death 
0	here finished he and all that he had made
0	viewed and behold all was entirely good 
0	so even and morn accomplished the sixth day 
0	yet not till the creator from his work
0	desisting though unwearied up returned 
0	up to the heaven of heavens his high abode 
0	thence to behold this new created world 
0	the addition of his empire how it showed
0	in prospect from his throne how good how fair 
0	answering his great idea up he rode
0	followed with acclamation and the sound
0	symphonious of ten thousand harps that tuned
0	angelick harmonies the earth the air
0	resounded thou rememberest for thou heardst 
0	the heavens and all the constellations rung 
0	the planets in their station listening stood 
0	while the bright pomp ascended jubilant 
0	open ye everlasting gates they sung 
0	open ye heavens your living doors let in
0	the great creator from his work returned
0	magnificent his six days work a world 
0	open and henceforth oft for god will deign
0	to visit oft the dwellings of just men 
0	delighted and with frequent intercourse
0	thither will send his winged messengers
0	on errands of supernal grace so sung
0	the glorious train ascending he through heaven 
0	that opened wide her blazing portals led
0	to god s eternal house direct the way 
0	a broad and ample road whose dust is gold
0	and pavement stars as stars to thee appear 
0	seen in the galaxy that milky way 
0	which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
0	powdered with stars and now on earth the seventh
0	evening arose in eden for the sun
0	was set and twilight from the east came on 
0	forerunning night when at the holy mount
0	of heaven s high seated top the imperial throne
0	of godhead fixed for ever firm and sure 
0	the filial power arrived and sat him down
0	with his great father for he also went
0	invisible yet staid such privilege
0	hath omnipresence and the work ordained 
0	author and end of all things and from work
0	now resting blessed and hallowed the seventh day 
0	as resting on that day from all his work 
0	but not in silence holy kept the harp
0	had work and rested not the solemn pipe 
0	and dulcimer all organs of sweet stop 
0	all sounds on fret by string or golden wire 
0	tempered soft tunings intermixed with voice
0	choral or unison of incense clouds 
0	fuming from golden censers hid the mount 
0	creation and the six days acts they sung 
0	great are thy works jehovah infinite
0	thy power what thought can measure thee or tongue
0	relate thee greater now in thy return
0	than from the giant angels thee that day
0	thy thunders magnified but to create
0	is greater than created to destroy 
0	who can impair thee mighty king or bound
0	thy empire easily the proud attempt
0	of spirits apostate and their counsels vain 
0	thou hast repelled while impiously they thought
0	thee to diminish and from thee withdraw
0	the number of thy worshippers who seeks
0	to lessen thee against his purpose serves
0	to manifest the more thy might his evil
0	thou usest and from thence createst more good 
0	witness this new made world another heaven
0	from heaven gate not far founded in view
0	on the clear hyaline the glassy sea 
0	of amplitude almost immense with stars
0	numerous and every star perhaps a world
0	of destined habitation but thou knowest
0	their seasons among these the seat of men 
0	earth with her nether ocean circumfused 
0	their pleasant dwelling place thrice happy men 
0	and sons of men whom god hath thus advanced 
0	created in his image there to dwell
0	and worship him and in reward to rule
0	over his works on earth in sea or air 
0	and multiply a race of worshippers
0	holy and just thrice happy if they know
0	their happiness and persevere upright 
0	so sung they and the empyrean rung
0	with halleluiahs thus was sabbath kept 
0	and thy request think now fulfilled that asked
0	how first this world and face of things began 
0	and what before thy memory was done
0	from the beginning that posterity 
0	informed by thee might know if else thou seekest
0	aught not surpassing human measure say 
0	the angel ended and in adam s ear
0	so charming left his voice that he a while
0	thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear 
0	then as new waked thus gratefully replied 
0	what thanks sufficient or what recompence
0	equal have i to render thee divine
0	historian who thus largely hast allayed
0	the thirst i had of knowledge and vouchsafed
0	this friendly condescension to relate
0	things else by me unsearchable now heard
0	with wonder but delight and as is due 
0	with glory attributed to the high
0	creator something yet of doubt remains 
0	which only thy solution can resolve 
0	when i behold this goodly frame this world 
0	of heaven and earth consisting and compute
0	their magnitudes this earth a spot a grain 
0	an atom with the firmament compared
0	and all her numbered stars that seem to roll
0	spaces incomprehensible for such
0	their distance argues and their swift return
0	diurnal merely to officiate light
0	round this opacous earth this punctual spot 
0	one day and night in all her vast survey
0	useless besides reasoning i oft admire 
0	how nature wise and frugal could commit
0	such disproportions with superfluous hand
0	so many nobler bodies to create 
0	greater so manifold to this one use 
0	for aught appears and on their orbs impose
0	such restless revolution day by day
0	repeated while the sedentary earth 
0	that better might with far less compass move 
0	served by more noble than herself attains
0	her end without least motion and receives 
0	as tribute such a sumless journey brought
0	of incorporeal speed her warmth and light 
0	speed to describe whose swiftness number fails 
0	so spake our sire and by his countenance seemed
0	entering on studious thoughts abstruse which eve
0	perceiving where she sat retired in sight 
0	with lowliness majestick from her seat 
0	and grace that won who saw to wish her stay 
0	rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers 
0	to visit how they prospered bud and bloom 
0	her nursery they at her coming sprung 
0	and touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew 
0	yet went she not as not with such discourse
0	delighted or not capable her ear
0	of what was high such pleasure she reserved 
0	adam relating she sole auditress 
0	her husband the relater she preferred
0	chose rather he she knew would intermix
0	grateful digressions and solve high dispute
0	with conjugal caresses from his lip
0	not words alone pleased her o when meet now
0	such pairs in love and mutual honour joined 
0	with goddess like demeanour forth she went 
0	not unattended for on her as queen 
0	a pomp of winning graces waited still 
0	and from about her shot darts of desire
0	into all eyes to wish her still in sight 
0	and raphael now to adam s doubt proposed 
0	benevolent and facile thus replied 
0	to ask or search i blame thee not for heaven
0	is as the book of god before thee set 
0	wherein to read his wonderous works and learn
0	his seasons hours or days or months or years 
0	this to attain whether heaven move or earth 
0	imports not if thou reckon right the rest
0	from man or angel the great architect
0	did wisely to conceal and not divulge
0	his secrets to be scanned by them who ought
0	rather admire or if they list to try
0	conjecture he his fabrick of the heavens
0	hath left to their disputes perhaps to move
0	his laughter at their quaint opinions wide
0	hereafter when they come to model heaven
0	and calculate the stars how they will wield
0	the mighty frame how build unbuild contrive
0	to save appearances how gird the sphere
0	with centrick and eccentrick scribbled o er 
0	cycle and epicycle orb in orb 
0	already by thy reasoning this i guess 
0	who art to lead thy offspring and supposest
0	that bodies bright and greater should not serve
0	the less not bright nor heaven such journeys run 
0	earth sitting still when she alone receives
0	the benefit consider first that great
0	or bright infers not excellence the earth
0	though in comparison of heaven so small 
0	nor glistering may of solid good contain
0	more plenty than the sun that barren shines 
0	whose virtue on itself works no effect 
0	but in the fruitful earth there first received 
0	his beams unactive else their vigour find 
0	yet not to earth are those bright luminaries
0	officious but to thee earth s habitant 
0	and for the heaven s wide circuit let it speak
0	the maker s high magnificence who built
0	so spacious and his line stretched out so far 
0	that man may know he dwells not in his own 
0	an edifice too large for him to fill 
0	lodged in a small partition and the rest
0	ordained for uses to his lord best known 
0	the swiftness of those circles attribute 
0	though numberless to his omnipotence 
0	that to corporeal substances could add
0	speed almost spiritual me thou thinkest not slow 
0	who since the morning hour set out from heaven
0	where god resides and ere mid day arrived
0	in eden distance inexpressible
0	by numbers that have name but this i urge 
0	admitting motion in the heavens to show
0	invalid that which thee to doubt it moved 
0	not that i so affirm though so it seem
0	to thee who hast thy dwelling here on earth 
0	god to remove his ways from human sense 
0	placed heaven from earth so far that earthly sight 
0	if it presume might err in things too high 
0	and no advantage gain what if the sun
0	be center to the world and other stars 
0	by his attractive virtue and their own
0	incited dance about him various rounds 
0	their wandering course now high now low then hid 
0	progressive retrograde or standing still 
0	in six thou seest and what if seventh to these
0	the planet earth so stedfast though she seem 
0	insensibly three different motions move 
0	which else to several spheres thou must ascribe 
0	moved contrary with thwart obliquities 
0	or save the sun his labour and that swift
0	nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed 
0	invisible else above all stars the wheel
0	of day and night which needs not thy belief 
0	if earth industrious of herself fetch day
0	travelling east and with her part averse
0	from the sun s beam meet night her other part
0	still luminous by his ray what if that light 
0	sent from her through the wide transpicuous air 
0	to the terrestrial moon be as a star 
0	enlightening her by day as she by night
0	this earth reciprocal if land be there 
0	fields and inhabitants her spots thou seest
0	as clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce
0	fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
0	allotted there and other suns perhaps 
0	with their attendant moons thou wilt descry 
0	communicating male and female light 
0	which two great sexes animate the world 
0	stored in each orb perhaps with some that live 
0	for such vast room in nature unpossessed
0	by living soul desart and desolate 
0	only to shine yet scarce to contribute
0	each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far
0	down to this habitable which returns
0	light back to them is obvious to dispute 
0	but whether thus these things or whether not 
0	but whether the sun predominant in heaven 
0	rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun 
0	he from the east his flaming road begin 
0	or she from west her silent course advance 
0	with inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
0	on her soft axle while she paces even 
0	and bears thee soft with the smooth hair along 
0	sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid 
0	leave them to god above him serve and fear 
0	of other creatures as him pleases best 
0	wherever placed let him dispose joy thou
0	in what he gives to thee this paradise
0	and thy fair eve heaven is for thee too high
0	to know what passes there be lowly wise 
0	think only what concerns thee and thy being 
0	dream not of other worlds what creatures there
0	live in what state condition or degree 
0	contented that thus far hath been revealed
0	not of earth only but of highest heaven 
0	to whom thus adam cleared of doubt replied 
0	how fully hast thou satisfied me pure
0	intelligence of heaven angel serene 
0	and freed from intricacies taught to live
0	the easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts
0	to interrupt the sweet of life from which
0	god hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares 
0	and not molest us unless we ourselves
0	seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain 
0	but apt the mind or fancy is to rove
0	unchecked and of her roving is no end 
0	till warned or by experience taught she learn 
0	that not to know at large of things remote
0	from use obscure and subtle but to know
0	that which before us lies in daily life 
0	is the prime wisdom what is more is fume 
0	or emptiness or fond impertinence 
0	and renders us in things that most concern 
0	unpractised unprepared and still to seek 
0	therefore from this high pitch let us descend
0	a lower flight and speak of things at hand
0	useful whence haply mention may arise
0	of something not unseasonable to ask 
0	by sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned 
0	thee i have heard relating what was done
0	ere my remembrance now hear me relate
0	my story which perhaps thou hast not heard 
0	and day is not yet spent till then thou seest
0	how subtly to detain thee i devise 
0	inviting thee to hear while i relate 
0	fond were it not in hope of thy reply 
0	for while i sit with thee i seem in heaven 
0	and sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
0	than fruits of palm tree pleasantest to thirst
0	and hunger both from labour at the hour
0	of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill 
0	though pleasant but thy words with grace divine
0	imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety 
0	to whom thus raphael answered heavenly meek 
0	nor are thy lips ungraceful sire of men 
0	nor tongue ineloquent for god on thee
0	abundantly his gifts hath also poured
0	inward and outward both his image fair 
0	speaking or mute all comeliness and grace
0	attends thee and each word each motion forms 
0	nor less think we in heaven of thee on earth
0	than of our fellow servant and inquire
0	gladly into the ways of god with man 
0	for god we see hath honoured thee and set
0	on man his equal love say therefore on 
0	for i that day was absent as befel 
0	bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure 
0	far on excursion toward the gates of hell 
0	squared in full legion such command we had 
0	to see that none thence issued forth a spy 
0	or enemy while god was in his work 
0	lest he incensed at such eruption bold 
0	destruction with creation might have mixed 
0	not that they durst without his leave attempt 
0	but us he sends upon his high behests
0	for state as sovran king and to inure
0	our prompt obedience fast we found fast shut 
0	the dismal gates and barricadoed strong 
0	but long ere our approaching heard within
0	noise other than the sound of dance or song 
0	torment and loud lament and furious rage 
0	glad we returned up to the coasts of light
0	ere sabbath evening so we had in charge 
0	but thy relation now for i attend 
0	pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine 
0	so spake the godlike power and thus our sire 
0	for man to tell how human life began
0	is hard for who himself beginning knew
0	desire with thee still longer to converse
0	induced me as new waked from soundest sleep 
0	soft on the flowery herb i found me laid 
0	in balmy sweat which with his beams the sun
0	soon dried and on the reeking moisture fed 
0	straight toward heaven my wondering eyes i turned 
0	and gazed a while the ample sky till raised
0	by quick instinctive motion up i sprung 
0	as thitherward endeavouring and upright
0	stood on my feet about me round i saw
0	hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains 
0	and liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these 
0	creatures that lived and moved and walked or flew 
0	birds on the branches warbling all things smiled 
0	with fragrance and with joy my heart o erflowed 
0	myself i then perused and limb by limb
0	surveyed and sometimes went and sometimes ran
0	with supple joints as lively vigour led 
0	but who i was or where or from what cause 
0	knew not to speak i tried and forthwith spake 
0	my tongue obeyed and readily could name
0	whate er i saw thou sun said i fair light 
0	and thou enlightened earth so fresh and gay 
0	and ye that live and move fair creatures tell 
0	tell if ye saw how i came thus how here 
0	not of myself by some great maker then 
0	in goodness and in power pre eminent 
0	tell me how may i know him how adore 
0	from whom i have that thus i move and live 
0	and feel that i am happier than i know 
0	while thus i called and strayed i knew not whither 
0	from where i first drew air and first beheld
0	this happy light when answer none returned 
0	on a green shady bank profuse of flowers 
0	pensive i sat me down there gentle sleep
0	first found me and with soft oppression seised
0	my droused sense untroubled though i thought
0	i then was passing to my former state
0	insensible and forthwith to dissolve 
0	when suddenly stood at my head a dream 
0	whose inward apparition gently moved
0	my fancy to believe i yet had being 
0	and lived one came methought of shape divine 
0	and said thy mansion wants thee adam rise 
0	first man of men innumerable ordained
0	first father called by thee i come thy guide
0	to the garden of bliss thy seat prepared 
0	so saying by the hand he took me raised 
0	and over fields and waters as in air
0	smooth sliding without step last led me up
0	a woody mountain whose high top was plain 
0	a circuit wide enclosed with goodliest trees
0	planted with walks and bowers that what i saw
0	of earth before scarce pleasant seemed each tree 
0	loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye
0	tempting stirred in me sudden appetite
0	to pluck and eat whereat i waked and found
0	before mine eyes all real as the dream
0	had lively shadowed here had new begun
0	my wandering had not he who was my guide
0	up hither from among the trees appeared 
0	presence divine rejoicing but with awe 
0	in adoration at his feet i fell
0	submiss he reared me and whom thou soughtest i am 
0	said mildly author of all this thou seest
0	above or round about thee or beneath 
0	this paradise i give thee count it thine
0	to till and keep and of the fruit to eat 
0	of every tree that in the garden grows
0	eat freely with glad heart fear here no dearth 
0	but of the tree whose operation brings
0	knowledge of good and ill which i have set
0	the pledge of thy obedience and thy faith 
0	amid the garden by the tree of life 
0	remember what i warn thee shun to taste 
0	and shun the bitter consequence for know 
0	the day thou eatest thereof my sole command
0	transgressed inevitably thou shalt die 
0	from that day mortal and this happy state
0	shalt lose expelled from hence into a world
0	of woe and sorrow sternly he pronounced
0	the rigid interdiction which resounds
0	yet dreadful in mine ear though in my choice
0	not to incur but soon his clear aspect
0	returned and gracious purpose thus renewed 
0	 not only these fair bounds but all the earth
0	to thee and to thy race i give as lords
0	possess it and all things that therein live 
0	or live in sea or air beast fish and fowl 
0	in sign whereof each bird and beast behold
0	after their kinds i bring them to receive
0	from thee their names and pay thee fealty
0	with low subjection understand the same
0	of fish within their watery residence 
0	not hither summoned since they cannot change
0	their element to draw the thinner air 
0	as thus he spake each bird and beast behold
0	approaching two and two these cowering low
0	with blandishment each bird stooped on his wing 
0	i named them as they passed and understood
0	their nature with such knowledge god endued
0	my sudden apprehension but in these
0	i found not what methought i wanted still 
0	and to the heavenly vision thus presumed 
0	o by what name for thou above all these 
0	above mankind or aught than mankind higher 
0	surpassest far my naming how may i
0	adore thee author of this universe 
0	and all this good to man for whose well being
0	so amply and with hands so liberal 
0	thou hast provided all things but with me
0	i see not who partakes in solitude
0	what happiness who can enjoy alone 
0	or all enjoying what contentment find 
0	thus i presumptuous and the vision bright 
0	as with a smile more brightened thus replied 
0	what callest thou solitude is not the earth
0	with various living creatures and the air
0	replenished and all these at thy command
0	to come and play before thee knowest thou not
0	their language and their ways they also know 
0	and reason not contemptibly with these
0	find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large 
0	so spake the universal lord and seemed
0	so ordering i with leave of speech implored 
0	and humble deprecation thus replied 
0	let not my words offend thee heavenly power 
0	my maker be propitious while i speak 
0	hast thou not made me here thy substitute 
0	and these inferiour far beneath me set 
0	among unequals what society
0	can sort what harmony or true delight 
0	which must be mutual in proportion due
0	given and received but in disparity
0	the one intense the other still remiss 
0	cannot well suit with either but soon prove
0	tedious alike of fellowship i speak
0	such as i seek fit to participate
0	all rational delight wherein the brute
0	cannot be human consort they rejoice
0	each with their kind lion with lioness 
0	so fitly them in pairs thou hast combined 
0	much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl
0	so well converse nor with the ox the ape 
0	worse then can man with beast and least of all 
0	whereto the almighty answered not displeased 
0	a nice and subtle happiness i see 
0	thou to thyself proposest in the choice
0	of thy associates adam and wilt taste
0	no pleasure though in pleasure solitary 
0	what thinkest thou then of me and this my state 
0	seem i to thee sufficiently possessed
0	of happiness or not who am alone
0	from all eternity for none i know
0	second to me or like equal much less 
0	how have i then with whom to hold converse 
0	save with the creatures which i made and those
0	to me inferiour infinite descents
0	beneath what other creatures are to thee 
0	he ceased i lowly answered to attain
0	the highth and depth of thy eternal ways
0	all human thoughts come short supreme of things 
0	thou in thyself art perfect and in thee
0	is no deficience found not so is man 
0	but in degree the cause of his desire
0	by conversation with his like to help
0	or solace his defects no need that thou
0	shouldst propagate already infinite 
0	and through all numbers absolute though one 
0	but man by number is to manifest
0	his single imperfection and beget
0	like of his like his image multiplied 
0	in unity defective which requires
0	collateral love and dearest amity 
0	thou in thy secresy although alone 
0	best with thyself accompanied seekest not
0	social communication yet so pleased 
0	canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt
0	of union or communion deified 
0	i by conversing cannot these erect
0	from prone nor in their ways complacence find 
0	thus i emboldened spake and freedom used
0	permissive and acceptance found which gained
0	this answer from the gracious voice divine 
0	thus far to try thee adam i was pleased 
0	and find thee knowing not of beasts alone 
0	which thou hast rightly named but of thyself 
0	expressing well the spirit within thee free 
0	my image not imparted to the brute 
0	whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
0	good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike 
0	and be so minded still i ere thou spakest 
0	knew it not good for man to be alone 
0	and no such company as then thou sawest
0	intended thee for trial only brought 
0	to see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet 
0	what next i bring shall please thee be assured 
0	thy likeness thy fit help thy other self 
0	thy wish exactly to thy heart s desire 
0	he ended or i heard no more for now
0	my earthly by his heavenly overpowered 
0	which it had long stood under strained to the highth
0	in that celestial colloquy sublime 
0	as with an object that excels the sense
0	dazzled and spent sunk down and sought repair
0	of sleep which instantly fell on me called
0	by nature as in aid and closed mine eyes 
0	mine eyes he closed but open left the cell
0	of fancy my internal sight by which 
0	abstract as in a trance methought i saw 
0	though sleeping where i lay and saw the shape
0	still glorious before whom awake i stood 
0	who stooping opened my left side and took
0	from thence a rib with cordial spirits warm 
0	and life blood streaming fresh wide was the wound 
0	but suddenly with flesh filled up and healed 
0	the rib he formed and fashioned with his hands 
0	under his forming hands a creature grew 
0	man like but different sex so lovely fair 
0	that what seemed fair in all the world seemed now
0	mean or in her summed up in her contained
0	and in her looks which from that time infused
0	sweetness into my heart unfelt before 
0	and into all things from her air inspired
0	the spirit of love and amorous delight 
0	she disappeared and left me dark i waked
0	to find her or for ever to deplore
0	her loss and other pleasures all abjure 
0	when out of hope behold her not far off 
0	such as i saw her in my dream adorned
0	with what all earth or heaven could bestow
0	to make her amiable on she came 
0	led by her heavenly maker though unseen 
0	and guided by his voice nor uninformed
0	of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites 
0	grace was in all her steps heaven in her eye 
0	in every gesture dignity and love 
0	i overjoyed could not forbear aloud 
0	this turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled
0	thy words creator bounteous and benign 
0	giver of all things fair but fairest this
0	of all thy gifts nor enviest i now see
0	bone of my bone flesh of my flesh myself
0	before me woman is her name of man
0	extracted for this cause he shall forego
0	father and mother and to his wife adhere 
0	and they shall be one flesh one heart one soul 
0	she heard me thus and though divinely brought 
0	yet innocence and virgin modesty 
0	her virtue and the conscience of her worth 
0	that would be wooed and not unsought be won 
0	not obvious not obtrusive but retired 
0	the more desirable or to say all 
0	nature herself though pure of sinful thought 
0	wrought in her so that seeing me she turned 
0	i followed her she what was honour knew 
0	and with obsequious majesty approved
0	my pleaded reason to the nuptial bower
0	i led her blushing like the morn all heaven 
0	and happy constellations on that hour
0	shed their selectest influence the earth
0	gave sign of gratulation and each hill 
0	joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs
0	whispered it to the woods and from their wings
0	flung rose flung odours from the spicy shrub 
0	disporting till the amorous bird of night
0	sung spousal and bid haste the evening star
0	on his hill top to light the bridal lamp 
0	thus have i told thee all my state and brought
0	my story to the sum of earthly bliss 
0	which i enjoy and must confess to find
0	in all things else delight indeed but such
0	as used or not works in the mind no change 
0	nor vehement desire these delicacies
0	i mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers 
0	walks and the melody of birds but here
0	far otherwise transported i behold 
0	transported touch here passion first i felt 
0	commotion strange in all enjoyments else
0	superiour and unmoved here only weak
0	against the charm of beauty s powerful glance 
0	or nature failed in me and left some part
0	not proof enough such object to sustain 
0	or from my side subducting took perhaps
0	more than enough at least on her bestowed
0	too much of ornament in outward show
0	elaborate of inward less exact 
0	for well i understand in the prime end
0	of nature her the inferiour in the mind
0	and inward faculties which most excel 
0	in outward also her resembling less
0	his image who made both and less expressing
0	the character of that dominion given
0	o er other creatures yet when i approach
0	her loveliness so absolute she seems
0	and in herself complete so well to know
0	her own that what she wills to do or say 
0	seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best 
0	all higher knowledge in her presence falls
0	degraded wisdom in discourse with her
0	loses discountenanced and like folly shows 
0	authority and reason on her wait 
0	as one intended first not after made
0	occasionally and to consummate all 
0	greatness of mind and nobleness their seat
0	build in her loveliest and create an awe
0	about her as a guard angelick placed 
0	to whom the angel with contracted brow 
0	accuse not nature she hath done her part 
0	do thou but thine and be not diffident
0	of wisdom she deserts thee not if thou
0	dismiss not her when most thou needest her nigh 
0	by attributing overmuch to things
0	less excellent as thou thyself perceivest 
0	for what admirest thou what transports thee so 
0	an outside fair no doubt and worthy well
0	thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love 
0	not thy subjection weigh with her thyself 
0	then value oft times nothing profits more
0	than self esteem grounded on just and right
0	well managed of that skill the more thou knowest 
0	the more she will acknowledge thee her head 
0	and to realities yield all her shows 
0	made so adorn for thy delight the more 
0	so awful that with honour thou mayest love
0	thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise 
0	but if the sense of touch whereby mankind
0	is propagated seem such dear delight
0	beyond all other think the same vouchsafed
0	to cattle and each beast which would not be
0	to them made common and divulged if aught
0	therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
0	the soul of man or passion in him move 
0	what higher in her society thou findest
0	attractive human rational love still 
0	in loving thou dost well in passion not 
0	wherein true love consists not love refines
0	the thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat
0	in reason and is judicious is the scale
0	by which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend 
0	not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause 
0	among the beasts no mate for thee was found 
0	to whom thus half abashed adam replied 
0	neither her outside formed so fair nor aught
0	in procreation common to all kinds 
0	 though higher of the genial bed by far 
0	and with mysterious reverence i deem 
0	so much delights me as those graceful acts 
0	those thousand decencies that daily flow
0	from all her words and actions mixed with love
0	and sweet compliance which declare unfeigned
0	union of mind or in us both one soul 
0	harmony to behold in wedded pair
0	more grateful than harmonious sound to the ear 
0	yet these subject not i to thee disclose
0	what inward thence i feel not therefore foiled 
0	who meet with various objects from the sense
0	variously representing yet still free 
0	approve the best and follow what i approve 
0	to love thou blamest me not for love thou sayest 
0	leads up to heaven is both the way and guide 
0	bear with me then if lawful what i ask 
0	love not the heavenly spirits and how their love
0	express they by looks only or do they mix
0	irradiance virtual or immediate touch 
0	to whom the angel with a smile that glowed
0	celestial rosy red love s proper hue 
0	answered let it suffice thee that thou knowest
0	us happy and without love no happiness 
0	whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest 
0	 and pure thou wert created we enjoy
0	in eminence and obstacle find none
0	of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars 
0	easier than air with air if spirits embrace 
0	total they mix union of pure with pure
0	desiring nor restrained conveyance need 
0	as flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul 
0	but i can now no more the parting sun
0	beyond the earth s green cape and verdant isles
0	hesperian sets my signal to depart 
0	be strong live happy and love but first of all 
0	him whom to love is to obey and keep
0	his great command take heed lest passion sway
0	thy judgement to do aught which else free will
0	would not admit thine and of all thy sons 
0	the weal or woe in thee is placed beware 
0	i in thy persevering shall rejoice 
0	and all the blest stand fast to stand or fall
0	free in thine own arbitrement it lies 
0	perfect within no outward aid require 
0	and all temptation to transgress repel 
0	so saying he arose whom adam thus
0	followed with benediction since to part 
0	go heavenly guest ethereal messenger 
0	sent from whose sovran goodness i adore 
0	gentle to me and affable hath been
0	thy condescension and shall be honoured ever
0	with grateful memory thou to mankind
0	be good and friendly still and oft return 
0	so parted they the angel up to heaven
0	from the thick shade and adam to his bower 
0	no more of talk where god or angel guest
0	with man as with his friend familiar us d 
0	to sit indulgent and with him partake
0	rural repast permitting him the while
0	venial discourse unblam d i now must change
0	those notes to tragick foul distrust and breach
0	disloyal on the part of man revolt 
0	and disobedience on the part of heaven
0	now alienated distance and distaste 
0	anger and just rebuke and judgement given 
0	that brought into this world a world of woe 
0	sin and her shadow death and misery
0	death s harbinger sad task yet argument
0	not less but more heroick than the wrath
0	of stern achilles on his foe pursued

0	the sun was sunk and after him the star
0	of hesperus whose office is to bring
0	twilight upon the earth short arbiter
0	 twixt day and night and now from end to end
0	night s hemisphere had veil d the horizon round 
0	when satan who late fled before the threats
0	of gabriel out of eden now improv d
0	in meditated fraud and malice bent
0	on man s destruction maugre what might hap
0	of heavier on himself fearless returned
0	by night he fled and at midnight returned
0	from compassing the earth cautious of day 
0	since uriel regent of the sun descried
0	his entrance and foreworned the cherubim
0	that kept their watch thence full of anguish driven 
0	the space of seven continued nights he rode
0	with darkness thrice the equinoctial line
0	he circled four times crossed the car of night
0	from pole to pole traversing each colure 
0	on the eighth returned and on the coast averse
0	from entrance or cherubick watch by stealth
0	found unsuspected way there was a place 
0	now not though sin not time first wrought the change 
0	where tigris at the foot of paradise 
0	into a gulf shot under ground till part
0	rose up a fountain by the tree of life 
0	in with the river sunk and with it rose
0	satan involved in rising mist then sought
0	where to lie hid sea he had searched and land 
0	from eden over pontus and the pool
0	maeotis up beyond the river ob 
0	downward as far antarctick and in length 
0	west from orontes to the ocean barred
0	at darien thence to the land where flows
0	ganges and indus thus the orb he roamed
0	with narrow search and with inspection deep
0	considered every creature which of all
0	most opportune might serve his wiles and found
0	the serpent subtlest beast of all the field 
0	him after long debate irresolute
0	of thoughts revolved his final sentence chose
0	fit vessel fittest imp of fraud in whom
0	to enter and his dark suggestions hide
0	from sharpest sight for in the wily snake
0	whatever sleights none would suspicious mark 
0	as from his wit and native subtlety
0	proceeding which in other beasts observed 
0	doubt might beget of diabolick power
0	active within beyond the sense of brute 
0	thus he resolved but first from inward grief
0	his bursting passion into plaints thus poured 
0	more justly seat worthier of gods as built
0	with second thoughts reforming what was old 
0	o earth how like to heaven if not preferred
0	for what god after better worse would build 
0	terrestrial heaven danced round by other heavens
0	that shine yet bear their bright officious lamps 
0	light above light for thee alone as seems 
0	in thee concentring all their precious beams
0	of sacred influence as god in heaven
0	is center yet extends to all so thou 
0	centring receivest from all those orbs in thee 
0	not in themselves all their known virtue appears
0	productive in herb plant and nobler birth
0	of creatures animate with gradual life
0	of growth sense reason all summed up in man 
0	with what delight could i have walked thee round 
0	if i could joy in aught sweet interchange
0	of hill and valley rivers woods and plains 
0	now land now sea and shores with forest crowned 
0	rocks dens and caves but i in none of these
0	find place or refuge and the more i see
0	pleasures about me so much more i feel
0	torment within me as from the hateful siege
0	of contraries all good to me becomes
0	bane and in heaven much worse would be my state 
0	but neither here seek i no nor in heaven
0	to dwell unless by mastering heaven s supreme 
0	nor hope to be myself less miserable
0	by what i seek but others to make such
0	as i though thereby worse to me redound 
0	for only in destroying i find ease
0	to my relentless thoughts and him destroyed 
0	or won to what may work his utter loss 
0	for whom all this was made all this will soon
0	follow as to him linked in weal or woe 
0	in woe then that destruction wide may range 
0	to me shall be the glory sole among
0	the infernal powers in one day to have marred
0	what he almighty styled six nights and days
0	continued making and who knows how long
0	before had been contriving though perhaps
0	not longer than since i in one night freed
0	from servitude inglorious well nigh half
0	the angelick name and thinner left the throng
0	of his adorers he to be avenged 
0	and to repair his numbers thus impaired 
0	whether such virtue spent of old now failed
0	more angels to create if they at least
0	are his created or to spite us more 
0	determined to advance into our room
0	a creature formed of earth and him endow 
0	exalted from so base original 
0	with heavenly spoils our spoils what he decreed 
0	he effected man he made and for him built
0	magnificent this world and earth his seat 
0	him lord pronounced and o indignity 
0	subjected to his service angel wings 
0	and flaming ministers to watch and tend
0	their earthly charge of these the vigilance
0	i dread and to elude thus wrapt in mist
0	of midnight vapour glide obscure and pry
0	in every bush and brake where hap may find
0	the serpent sleeping in whose mazy folds
0	to hide me and the dark intent i bring 
0	o foul descent that i who erst contended
0	with gods to sit the highest am now constrained
0	into a beast and mixed with bestial slime 
0	this essence to incarnate and imbrute 
0	that to the highth of deity aspired 
0	but what will not ambition and revenge
0	descend to who aspires must down as low
0	as high he soared obnoxious first or last 
0	to basest things revenge at first though sweet 
0	bitter ere long back on itself recoils 
0	let it i reck not so it light well aimed 
0	since higher i fall short on him who next
0	provokes my envy this new favourite
0	of heaven this man of clay son of despite 
0	whom us the more to spite his maker raised
0	from dust spite then with spite is best repaid 
0	so saying through each thicket dank or dry 
0	like a black mist low creeping he held on
0	his midnight search where soonest he might find
0	the serpent him fast sleeping soon he found
0	in labyrinth of many a round self rolled 
0	his head the midst well stored with subtile wiles 
0	not yet in horrid shade or dismal den 
0	nor nocent yet but on the grassy herb 
0	fearless unfeared he slept in at his mouth
0	the devil entered and his brutal sense 
0	in heart or head possessing soon inspired
0	with act intelligential but his sleep
0	disturbed not waiting close the approach of morn 
0	now when as sacred light began to dawn
0	in eden on the humid flowers that breathed
0	their morning incense when all things that breathe 
0	from the earth s great altar send up silent praise
0	to the creator and his nostrils fill
0	with grateful smell forth came the human pair 
0	and joined their vocal worship to the quire
0	of creatures wanting voice that done partake
0	the season prime for sweetest scents and airs 
0	then commune how that day they best may ply
0	their growing work for much their work out grew
0	the hands dispatch of two gardening so wide 
0	and eve first to her husband thus began 
0	adam well may we labour still to dress
0	this garden still to tend plant herb and flower 
0	our pleasant task enjoined but till more hands
0	aid us the work under our labour grows 
0	luxurious by restraint what we by day
0	lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind 
0	one night or two with wanton growth derides
0	tending to wild thou therefore now advise 
0	or bear what to my mind first thoughts present 
0	let us divide our labours thou where choice
0	leads thee or where most needs whether to wind
0	the woodbine round this arbour or direct
0	the clasping ivy where to climb while i 
0	in yonder spring of roses intermixed
0	with myrtle find what to redress till noon 
0	for while so near each other thus all day
0	our task we choose what wonder if so near
0	looks intervene and smiles or object new
0	casual discourse draw on which intermits
0	our day s work brought to little though begun
0	early and the hour of supper comes unearned 
0	to whom mild answer adam thus returned 
0	sole eve associate sole to me beyond
0	compare above all living creatures dear 
0	well hast thou motioned well thy thoughts employed 
0	how we might best fulfil the work which here
0	god hath assigned us nor of me shalt pass
0	unpraised for nothing lovelier can be found
0	in woman than to study houshold good 
0	and good works in her husband to promote 
0	yet not so strictly hath our lord imposed
0	labour as to debar us when we need
0	refreshment whether food or talk between 
0	food of the mind or this sweet intercourse
0	of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow 
0	to brute denied and are of love the food 
0	love not the lowest end of human life 
0	for not to irksome toil but to delight 
0	he made us and delight to reason joined 
0	these paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands
0	will keep from wilderness with ease as wide
0	as we need walk till younger hands ere long
0	assist us but if much converse perhaps
0	thee satiate to short absence i could yield 
0	for solitude sometimes is best society 
0	and short retirement urges sweet return 
0	but other doubt possesses me lest harm
0	befall thee severed from me for thou knowest
0	what hath been warned us what malicious foe
0	envying our happiness and of his own
0	despairing seeks to work us woe and shame
0	by sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand
0	watches no doubt with greedy hope to find
0	his wish and best advantage us asunder 
0	hopeless to circumvent us joined where each
0	to other speedy aid might lend at need 
0	whether his first design be to withdraw
0	our fealty from god or to disturb
0	conjugal love than which perhaps no bliss
0	enjoyed by us excites his envy more 
0	or this or worse leave not the faithful side
0	that gave thee being still shades thee and protects 
0	the wife where danger or dishonour lurks 
0	safest and seemliest by her husband stays 
0	who guards her or with her the worst endures 
0	to whom the virgin majesty of eve 
0	as one who loves and some unkindness meets 
0	with sweet austere composure thus replied 
0	offspring of heaven and earth and all earth s lord 
0	that such an enemy we have who seeks
0	our ruin both by thee informed i learn 
0	and from the parting angel over heard 
0	as in a shady nook i stood behind 
0	just then returned at shut of evening flowers 
0	but that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
0	to god or thee because we have a foe
0	may tempt it i expected not to hear 
0	his violence thou fearest not being such
0	as we not capable of death or pain 
0	can either not receive or can repel 
0	his fraud is then thy fear which plain infers
0	thy equal fear that my firm faith and love
0	can by his fraud be shaken or seduced 
0	thoughts which how found they harbour in thy breast 
0	adam mis thought of her to thee so dear 
0	to whom with healing words adam replied 
0	daughter of god and man immortal eve 
0	for such thou art from sin and blame entire 
0	not diffident of thee do i dissuade
0	thy absence from my sight but to avoid
0	the attempt itself intended by our foe 
0	for he who tempts though in vain at least asperses
0	the tempted with dishonour foul supposed
0	not incorruptible of faith not proof
0	against temptation thou thyself with scorn
0	and anger wouldst resent the offered wrong 
0	though ineffectual found misdeem not then 
0	if such affront i labour to avert
0	from thee alone which on us both at once
0	the enemy though bold will hardly dare 
0	or daring first on me the assault shall light 
0	nor thou his malice and false guile contemn 
0	subtle he needs must be who could seduce
0	angels nor think superfluous other s aid 
0	i from the influence of thy looks receive
0	access in every virtue in thy sight
0	more wise more watchful stronger if need were
0	of outward strength while shame thou looking on 
0	shame to be overcome or over reached 
0	would utmost vigour raise and raised unite 
0	why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
0	when i am present and thy trial choose
0	with me best witness of thy virtue tried 
0	so spake domestick adam in his care
0	and matrimonial love but eve who thought
0	less attributed to her faith sincere 
0	thus her reply with accent sweet renewed 
0	if this be our condition thus to dwell
0	in narrow circuit straitened by a foe 
0	subtle or violent we not endued
0	single with like defence wherever met 
0	how are we happy still in fear of harm 
0	but harm precedes not sin only our foe 
0	tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
0	of our integrity his foul esteem
0	sticks no dishonour on our front but turns
0	foul on himself then wherefore shunned or feared
0	by us who rather double honour gain
0	from his surmise proved false find peace within 
0	favour from heaven our witness from the event 
0	and what is faith love virtue unassayed
0	alone without exteriour help sustained 
0	let us not then suspect our happy state
0	left so imperfect by the maker wise 
0	as not secure to single or combined 
0	frail is our happiness if this be so 
0	and eden were no eden thus exposed 
0	to whom thus adam fervently replied 
0	o woman best are all things as the will
0	of god ordained them his creating hand
0	nothing imperfect or deficient left
0	of all that he created much less man 
0	or aught that might his happy state secure 
0	secure from outward force within himself
0	the danger lies yet lies within his power 
0	against his will he can receive no harm 
0	but god left free the will for what obeys
0	reason is free and reason he made right 
0	but bid her well be ware and still erect 
0	lest by some fair appearing good surprised 
0	she dictate false and mis inform the will
0	to do what god expressly hath forbid 
0	not then mistrust but tender love enjoins 
0	that i should mind thee oft and mind thou me 
0	firm we subsist yet possible to swerve 
0	since reason not impossibly may meet
0	some specious object by the foe suborned 
0	and fall into deception unaware 
0	not keeping strictest watch as she was warned 
0	seek not temptation then which to avoid
0	were better and most likely if from me
0	thou sever not trial will come unsought 
0	wouldst thou approve thy constancy approve
0	first thy obedience the other who can know 
0	not seeing thee attempted who attest 
0	but if thou think trial unsought may find
0	us both securer than thus warned thou seemest 
0	go for thy stay not free absents thee more 
0	go in thy native innocence rely
0	on what thou hast of virtue summon all 
0	for god towards thee hath done his part do thine 
0	so spake the patriarch of mankind but eve
0	persisted yet submiss though last replied 
0	with thy permission then and thus forewarned
0	chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
0	touched only that our trial when least sought 
0	may find us both perhaps far less prepared 
0	the willinger i go nor much expect
0	a foe so proud will first the weaker seek 
0	so bent the more shall shame him his repulse 
0	thus saying from her husband s hand her hand
0	soft she withdrew and like a wood nymph light 
0	oread or dryad or of delia s train 
0	betook her to the groves but delia s self
0	in gait surpassed and goddess like deport 
0	though not as she with bow and quiver armed 
0	but with such gardening tools as art yet rude 
0	guiltless of fire had formed or angels brought 
0	to pales or pomona thus adorned 
0	likest she seemed pomona when she fled
0	vertumnus or to ceres in her prime 
0	yet virgin of proserpina from jove 
0	her long with ardent look his eye pursued
0	delighted but desiring more her stay 
0	oft he to her his charge of quick return
0	repeated she to him as oft engaged
0	to be returned by noon amid the bower 
0	and all things in best order to invite
0	noontide repast or afternoon s repose 
0	o much deceived much failing hapless eve 
0	of thy presumed return event perverse 
0	thou never from that hour in paradise
0	foundst either sweet repast or sound repose 
0	such ambush hid among sweet flowers and shades 
0	waited with hellish rancour imminent
0	to intercept thy way or send thee back
0	despoiled of innocence of faith of bliss 
0	for now and since first break of dawn the fiend 
0	mere serpent in appearance forth was come 
0	and on his quest where likeliest he might find
0	the only two of mankind but in them
0	the whole included race his purposed prey 
0	in bower and field he sought where any tuft
0	of grove or garden plot more pleasant lay 
0	their tendance or plantation for delight 
0	by fountain or by shady rivulet
0	he sought them both but wished his hap might find
0	eve separate he wished but not with hope
0	of what so seldom chanced when to his wish 
0	beyond his hope eve separate he spies 
0	veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood 
0	half spied so thick the roses blushing round
0	about her glowed oft stooping to support
0	each flower of slender stalk whose head though gay
0	carnation purple azure or specked with gold 
0	hung drooping unsustained them she upstays
0	gently with myrtle band mindless the while
0	herself though fairest unsupported flower 
0	from her best prop so far and storm so nigh 
0	nearer he drew and many a walk traversed
0	of stateliest covert cedar pine or palm 
0	then voluble and bold now hid now seen 
0	among thick woven arborets and flowers
0	imbordered on each bank the hand of eve 
0	spot more delicious than those gardens feigned
0	or of revived adonis or renowned
0	alcinous host of old laertes son 
0	or that not mystick where the sapient king
0	much he the place admired the person more 
0	as one who long in populous city pent 
0	where houses thick and sewers annoy the air 
0	forth issuing on a summer s morn to breathe
0	among the pleasant villages and farms
0	adjoined from each thing met conceives delight 
0	the smell of grain or tedded grass or kine 
0	or dairy each rural sight each rural sound 
0	if chance with nymph like step fair virgin pass 
0	what pleasing seemed for her now pleases more 
0	she most and in her look sums all delight 
0	such pleasure took the serpent to behold
0	this flowery plat the sweet recess of eve
0	thus early thus alone her heavenly form
0	angelick but more soft and feminine 
0	her graceful innocence her every air
0	of gesture or least action overawed
0	his malice and with rapine sweet bereaved
0	his fierceness of the fierce intent it brought 
0	that space the evil one abstracted stood
0	from his own evil and for the time remained
0	stupidly good of enmity disarmed 
0	of guile of hate of envy of revenge 
0	but the hot hell that always in him burns 
0	though in mid heaven soon ended his delight 
0	and tortures him now more the more he sees
0	of pleasure not for him ordained then soon
0	fierce hate he recollects and all his thoughts
0	of mischief gratulating thus excites 
0	thoughts whither have ye led me with what sweet
0	compulsion thus transported to forget
0	what hither brought us hate not love nor hope
0	of paradise for hell hope here to taste
0	of pleasure but all pleasure to destroy 
0	save what is in destroying other joy
0	to me is lost then let me not let pass
0	occasion which now smiles behold alone
0	the woman opportune to all attempts 
0	her husband for i view far round not nigh 
0	whose higher intellectual more i shun 
0	and strength of courage haughty and of limb
0	heroick built though of terrestrial mould 
0	foe not informidable exempt from wound 
0	i not so much hath hell debased and pain
0	enfeebled me to what i was in heaven 
0	she fair divinely fair fit love for gods 
0	not terrible though terrour be in love
0	and beauty not approached by stronger hate 
0	hate stronger under show of love well feigned 
0	the way which to her ruin now i tend 
0	so spake the enemy of mankind enclosed
0	in serpent inmate bad and toward eve
0	addressed his way not with indented wave 
0	prone on the ground as since but on his rear 
0	circular base of rising folds that towered
0	fold above fold a surging maze his head
0	crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes 
0	with burnished neck of verdant gold erect
0	amidst his circling spires that on the grass
0	floated redundant pleasing was his shape
0	and lovely never since of serpent kind
0	lovelier not those that in illyria changed 
0	in epidaurus nor to which transformed
0	ammonian jove or capitoline was seen 
0	he with olympias this with her who bore
0	scipio the highth of rome with tract oblique
0	at first as one who sought access but feared
0	to interrupt side long he works his way 
0	as when a ship by skilful steersmen wrought
0	nigh river s mouth or foreland where the wind
0	veers oft as oft so steers and shifts her sail 
0	so varied he and of his tortuous train
0	curled many a wanton wreath in sight of eve 
0	to lure her eye she busied heard the sound
0	of rusling leaves but minded not as used
0	to such disport before her through the field 
0	from every beast more duteous at her call 
0	than at circean call the herd disguised 
0	he bolder now uncalled before her stood 
0	but as in gaze admiring oft he bowed
0	his turret crest and sleek enamelled neck 
0	fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod 
0	the eye of eve to mark his play he glad
0	of her attention gained with serpent tongue
0	organick or impulse of vocal air 
0	his fraudulent temptation thus began 
0	wonder not sovran mistress if perhaps
0	thou canst who art sole wonder much less arm
0	thy looks the heaven of mildness with disdain 
0	displeased that i approach thee thus and gaze
0	insatiate i thus single nor have feared
0	thy awful brow more awful thus retired 
0	fairest resemblance of thy maker fair 
0	thee all things living gaze on all things thine
0	by gift and thy celestial beauty adore
0	with ravishment beheld there best beheld 
0	where universally admired but here
0	in this enclosure wild these beasts among 
0	beholders rude and shallow to discern
0	half what in thee is fair one man except 
0	who sees thee and what is one who should be seen
0	a goddess among gods adored and served
0	by angels numberless thy daily train 
0	so glozed the tempter and his proem tuned 
0	into the heart of eve his words made way 
0	though at the voice much marvelling at length 
0	not unamazed she thus in answer spake 
0	what may this mean language of man pronounced
0	by tongue of brute and human sense expressed 
0	the first at least of these i thought denied
0	to beasts whom god on their creation day 
0	created mute to all articulate sound 
0	the latter i demur for in their looks
0	much reason and in their actions oft appears 
0	thee serpent subtlest beast of all the field
0	i knew but not with human voice endued 
0	redouble then this miracle and say 
0	how camest thou speakable of mute and how
0	to me so friendly grown above the rest
0	of brutal kind that daily are in sight 
0	say for such wonder claims attention due 
0	to whom the guileful tempter thus replied 
0	empress of this fair world resplendent eve 
0	easy to me it is to tell thee all
0	what thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed 
0	i was at first as other beasts that graze
0	the trodden herb of abject thoughts and low 
0	as was my food nor aught but food discerned
0	or sex and apprehended nothing high 
0	till on a day roving the field i chanced
0	a goodly tree far distant to behold
0	loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed 
0	ruddy and gold i nearer drew to gaze 
0	when from the boughs a savoury odour blown 
0	grateful to appetite more pleased my sense
0	than smell of sweetest fennel or the teats
0	of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even 
0	unsucked of lamb or kid that tend their play 
0	to satisfy the sharp desire i had
0	of tasting those fair apples i resolved
0	not to defer hunger and thirst at once 
0	powerful persuaders quickened at the scent
0	of that alluring fruit urged me so keen 
0	about the mossy trunk i wound me soon 
0	for high from ground the branches would require
0	thy utmost reach or adam s round the tree
0	all other beasts that saw with like desire
0	longing and envying stood but could not reach 
0	amid the tree now got where plenty hung
0	tempting so nigh to pluck and eat my fill
0	i spared not for such pleasure till that hour 
0	at feed or fountain never had i found 
0	sated at length ere long i might perceive
0	strange alteration in me to degree
0	of reason in my inward powers and speech
0	wanted not long though to this shape retained 
0	thenceforth to speculations high or deep
0	i turned my thoughts and with capacious mind
0	considered all things visible in heaven 
0	or earth or middle all things fair and good 
0	but all that fair and good in thy divine
0	semblance and in thy beauty s heavenly ray 
0	united i beheld no fair to thine
0	equivalent or second which compelled
0	me thus though importune perhaps to come
0	and gaze and worship thee of right declared
0	sovran of creatures universal dame 
0	so talked the spirited sly snake and eve 
0	yet more amazed unwary thus replied 
0	serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt
0	the virtue of that fruit in thee first proved 
0	but say where grows the tree from hence how far 
0	for many are the trees of god that grow
0	in paradise and various yet unknown
0	to us in such abundance lies our choice 
0	as leaves a greater store of fruit untouched 
0	still hanging incorruptible till men
0	grow up to their provision and more hands
0	help to disburden nature of her birth 
0	to whom the wily adder blithe and glad 
0	empress the way is ready and not long 
0	beyond a row of myrtles on a flat 
0	fast by a fountain one small thicket past
0	of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept
0	my conduct i can bring thee thither soon
0	lead then said eve he leading swiftly rolled
0	in tangles and made intricate seem straight 
0	to mischief swift hope elevates and joy
0	brightens his crest as when a wandering fire 
0	compact of unctuous vapour which the night
0	condenses and the cold environs round 
0	kindled through agitation to a flame 
0	which oft they say some evil spirit attends 
0	hovering and blazing with delusive light 
0	misleads the amazed night wanderer from his way
0	to bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool 
0	there swallowed up and lost from succour far 
0	so glistered the dire snake and into fraud
0	led eve our credulous mother to the tree
0	of prohibition root of all our woe 
0	which when she saw thus to her guide she spake 
0	serpent we might have spared our coming hither 
0	fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess 
0	the credit of whose virtue rest with thee 
0	wonderous indeed if cause of such effects 
0	but of this tree we may not taste nor touch 
0	god so commanded and left that command
0	sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
0	law to ourselves our reason is our law 
0	to whom the tempter guilefully replied 
0	indeed hath god then said that of the fruit
0	of all these garden trees ye shall not eat 
0	yet lords declared of all in earth or air 
0	to whom thus eve yet sinless of the fruit
0	of each tree in the garden we may eat 
0	but of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
0	the garden god hath said ye shall not eat
0	thereof nor shall ye touch it lest ye die 
0	she scarce had said though brief when now more bold
0	the tempter but with show of zeal and love
0	to man and indignation at his wrong 
0	new part puts on and as to passion moved 
0	fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act
0	raised as of some great matter to begin 
0	as when of old some orator renowned 
0	in athens or free rome where eloquence
0	flourished since mute to some great cause addressed 
0	stood in himself collected while each part 
0	motion each act won audience ere the tongue 
0	sometimes in highth began as no delay
0	of preface brooking through his zeal of right 
0	so standing moving or to highth up grown 
0	the tempter all impassioned thus began 
0	o sacred wise and wisdom giving plant 
0	mother of science now i feel thy power
0	within me clear not only to discern
0	things in their causes but to trace the ways
0	of highest agents deemed however wise 
0	queen of this universe do not believe
0	those rigid threats of death ye shall not die 
0	how should you by the fruit it gives you life
0	to knowledge by the threatener look on me 
0	me who have touched and tasted yet both live 
0	and life more perfect have attained than fate
0	meant me by venturing higher than my lot 
0	shall that be shut to man which to the beast
0	is open or will god incense his ire
0	for such a petty trespass and not praise
0	rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain
0	of death denounced whatever thing death be 
0	deterred not from achieving what might lead
0	to happier life knowledge of good and evil 
0	of good how just of evil if what is evil
0	be real why not known since easier shunned 
0	god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just 
0	not just not god not feared then nor obeyed 
0	your fear itself of death removes the fear 
0	why then was this forbid why but to awe 
0	why but to keep ye low and ignorant 
0	his worshippers he knows that in the day
0	ye eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear 
0	yet are but dim shall perfectly be then
0	opened and cleared and ye shall be as gods 
0	knowing both good and evil as they know 
0	that ye shall be as gods since i as man 
0	internal man is but proportion meet 
0	i of brute human ye of human gods 
0	so ye shall die perhaps by putting off
0	human to put on gods death to be wished 
0	though threatened which no worse than this can bring 
0	and what are gods that man may not become
0	as they participating god like food 
0	the gods are first and that advantage use
0	on our belief that all from them proceeds 
0	i question it for this fair earth i see 
0	warmed by the sun producing every kind 
0	them nothing if they all things who enclosed
0	knowledge of good and evil in this tree 
0	that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
0	wisdom without their leave and wherein lies
0	the offence that man should thus attain to know 
0	what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
0	impart against his will if all be his 
0	or is it envy and can envy dwell
0	in heavenly breasts these these and many more
0	causes import your need of this fair fruit 
0	goddess humane reach then and freely taste 
0	he ended and his words replete with guile 
0	into her heart too easy entrance won 
0	fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold
0	might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
0	yet rung of his persuasive words impregned
0	with reason to her seeming and with truth 
0	mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked
0	an eager appetite raised by the smell
0	so savoury of that fruit which with desire 
0	inclinable now grown to touch or taste 
0	solicited her longing eye yet first
0	pausing a while thus to herself she mused 
0	great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits 
0	though kept from man and worthy to be admired 
0	whose taste too long forborn at first assay
0	gave elocution to the mute and taught
0	the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise 
0	thy praise he also who forbids thy use 
0	conceals not from us naming thee the tree
0	of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil 
0	forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
0	commends thee more while it infers the good
0	by thee communicated and our want 
0	for good unknown sure is not had or had
0	and yet unknown is as not had at all 
0	in plain then what forbids he but to know 
0	forbids us good forbids us to be wise 
0	such prohibitions bind not but if death
0	bind us with after bands what profits then
0	our inward freedom in the day we eat
0	of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die 
0	how dies the serpent he hath eaten and lives 
0	and knows and speaks and reasons and discerns 
0	irrational till then for us alone
0	was death invented or to us denied
0	this intellectual food for beasts reserved 
0	for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
0	hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
0	the good befallen him author unsuspect 
0	friendly to man far from deceit or guile 
0	what fear i then rather what know to fear
0	under this ignorance of good and evil 
0	of god or death of law or penalty 
0	here grows the cure of all this fruit divine 
0	fair to the eye inviting to the taste 
0	of virtue to make wise what hinders then
0	of man s first disobedience and the fruit
0	to reach and feed at once both body and mind 
0	so saying her rash hand in evil hour
0	forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she eat 
0	earth felt the wound and nature from her seat 
0	sighing through all her works gave signs of woe 
0	that all was lost back to the thicket slunk
0	the guilty serpent and well might for eve 
0	intent now wholly on her taste nought else
0	regarded such delight till then as seemed 
0	in fruit she never tasted whether true
0	or fancied so through expectation high
0	of knowledge not was godhead from her thought 
0	greedily she ingorged without restraint 
0	and knew not eating death satiate at length 
0	and hightened as with wine jocund and boon 
0	thus to herself she pleasingly began 
0	o sovran virtuous precious of all trees
0	in paradise of operation blest
0	to sapience hitherto obscured infamed 
0	and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
0	created but henceforth my early care 
0	not without song each morning and due praise 
0	shall tend thee and the fertile burden ease
0	of thy full branches offered free to all 
0	till dieted by thee i grow mature
0	in knowledge as the gods who all things know 
0	though others envy what they cannot give 
0	for had the gift been theirs it had not here
0	thus grown experience next to thee i owe 
0	best guide not following thee i had remained
0	in ignorance thou openest wisdom s way 
0	and givest access though secret she retire 
0	and i perhaps am secret heaven is high 
0	high and remote to see from thence distinct
0	each thing on earth and other care perhaps
0	may have diverted from continual watch
0	our great forbidder safe with all his spies
0	about him but to adam in what sort
0	shall i appear shall i to him make known
0	as yet my change and give him to partake
0	full happiness with me or rather not 
0	but keeps the odds of knowledge in my power
0	without copartner so to add what wants
0	in female sex the more to draw his love 
0	and render me more equal and perhaps 
0	a thing not undesirable sometime
0	superiour for inferiour who is free
0	this may be well but what if god have seen 
0	and death ensue then i shall be no more 
0	and adam wedded to another eve 
0	shall live with her enjoying i extinct 
0	a death to think confirmed then i resolve 
0	adam shall share with me in bliss or woe 
0	so dear i love him that with him all deaths
0	i could endure without him live no life 
0	so saying from the tree her step she turned 
0	but first low reverence done as to the power
0	that dwelt within whose presence had infused
0	into the plant sciential sap derived
0	from nectar drink of gods adam the while 
0	waiting desirous her return had wove
0	of choicest flowers a garland to adorn
0	her tresses and her rural labours crown 
0	as reapers oft are wont their harvest queen 
0	great joy he promised to his thoughts and new
0	solace in her return so long delayed 
0	yet oft his heart divine of something ill 
0	misgave him he the faltering measure felt 
0	and forth to meet her went the way she took
0	that morn when first they parted by the tree
0	of knowledge he must pass there he her met 
0	scarce from the tree returning in her hand
0	a bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled 
0	new gathered and ambrosial smell diffused 
0	to him she hasted in her face excuse
0	came prologue and apology too prompt 
0	which with bland words at will she thus addressed 
0	hast thou not wondered adam at my stay 
0	thee i have missed and thought it long deprived
0	thy presence agony of love till now
0	not felt nor shall be twice for never more
0	mean i to try what rash untried i sought 
0	the pain of absence from thy sight but strange
0	hath been the cause and wonderful to hear 
0	this tree is not as we are told a tree
0	of danger tasted nor to evil unknown
0	opening the way but of divine effect
0	to open eyes and make them gods who taste 
0	and hath been tasted such the serpent wise 
0	or not restrained as we or not obeying 
0	hath eaten of the fruit and is become 
0	not dead as we are threatened but thenceforth
0	endued with human voice and human sense 
0	reasoning to admiration and with me
0	persuasively hath so prevailed that i
0	have also tasted and have also found
0	the effects to correspond opener mine eyes 
0	dim erst dilated spirits ampler heart 
0	and growing up to godhead which for thee
0	chiefly i sought without thee can despise 
0	for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss 
0	tedious unshared with thee and odious soon 
0	thou therefore also taste that equal lot
0	may join us equal joy as equal love 
0	lest thou not tasting different degree
0	disjoin us and i then too late renounce
0	deity for thee when fate will not permit 
0	thus eve with countenance blithe her story told 
0	but in her cheek distemper flushing glowed 
0	on the other side adam soon as he heard
0	the fatal trespass done by eve amazed 
0	astonied stood and blank while horrour chill
0	ran through his veins and all his joints relaxed 
0	from his slack hand the garland wreathed for eve
0	down dropt and all the faded roses shed 
0	speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
0	first to himself he inward silence broke 
0	o fairest of creation last and best
0	of all god s works creature in whom excelled
0	whatever can to sight or thought be formed 
0	holy divine good amiable or sweet 
0	how art thou lost how on a sudden lost 
0	defaced deflowered and now to death devote 
0	rather how hast thou yielded to transgress
0	the strict forbiddance how to violate
0	the sacred fruit forbidden some cursed fraud
0	of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown 
0	and me with thee hath ruined for with thee
0	certain my resolution is to die 
0	how can i live without thee how forego
0	thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined 
0	to live again in these wild woods forlorn 
0	should god create another eve and i
0	another rib afford yet loss of thee
0	would never from my heart no no i feel
0	the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh 
0	bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
0	mine never shall be parted bliss or woe 
0	so having said as one from sad dismay
0	recomforted and after thoughts disturbed
0	submitting to what seemed remediless 
0	thus in calm mood his words to eve he turned 
0	bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous eve 
0	and peril great provoked who thus hast dared 
0	had it been only coveting to eye
0	that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence 
0	much more to taste it under ban to touch 
0	but past who can recall or done undo 
0	perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
0	is not so heinous now foretasted fruit 
0	profaned first by the serpent by him first
0	made common and unhallowed ere our taste 
0	nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives 
0	lives as thou saidst and gains to live as man 
0	higher degree of life inducement strong
0	to us as likely tasting to attain
0	proportional ascent which cannot be
0	but to be gods or angels demi gods 
0	nor can i think that god creator wise 
0	though threatening will in earnest so destroy
0	us his prime creatures dignified so high 
0	set over all his works which in our fall 
0	for us created needs with us must fail 
0	dependant made so god shall uncreate 
0	be frustrate do undo and labour lose 
0	not well conceived of god who though his power
0	creation could repeat yet would be loth
0	us to abolish lest the adversary
0	triumph and say fickle their state whom god
0	most favours who can please him long me first
0	he ruined now mankind whom will he next 
0	matter of scorn not to be given the foe 
0	however i with thee have fixed my lot 
0	certain to undergo like doom if death
0	consort with thee death is to me as life 
0	so forcible within my heart i feel
0	the bond of nature draw me to my own 
0	my own in thee for what thou art is mine 
0	our state cannot be severed we are one 
0	one flesh to lose thee were to lose myself 
0	so adam and thus eve to him replied 
0	o glorious trial of exceeding love 
0	illustrious evidence example high 
0	engaging me to emulate but short
0	of thy perfection how shall i attain 
0	adam from whose dear side i boast me sprung 
0	and gladly of our union hear thee speak 
0	one heart one soul in both whereof good proof
0	this day affords declaring thee resolved 
0	rather than death or aught than death more dread 
0	shall separate us linked in love so dear 
0	to undergo with me one guilt one crime 
0	if any be of tasting this fair fruit 
0	whose virtue for of good still good proceeds 
0	direct or by occasion hath presented
0	this happy trial of thy love which else
0	so eminently never had been known 
0	were it i thought death menaced would ensue
0	this my attempt i would sustain alone
0	the worst and not persuade thee rather die
0	deserted than oblige thee with a fact
0	pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured
0	remarkably so late of thy so true 
0	so faithful love unequalled but i feel
0	far otherwise the event not death but life
0	augmented opened eyes new hopes new joys 
0	taste so divine that what of sweet before
0	hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh 
0	on my experience adam freely taste 
0	and fear of death deliver to the winds 
0	so saying she embraced him and for joy
0	tenderly wept much won that he his love
0	had so ennobled as of choice to incur
0	divine displeasure for her sake or death 
0	in recompence for such compliance bad
0	such recompence best merits from the bough
0	she gave him of that fair enticing fruit
0	with liberal hand he scrupled not to eat 
0	against his better knowledge not deceived 
0	but fondly overcome with female charm 
0	earth trembled from her entrails as again
0	in pangs and nature gave a second groan 
0	sky loured and muttering thunder some sad drops
0	wept at completing of the mortal sin
0	original while adam took no thought 
0	eating his fill nor eve to iterate
0	her former trespass feared the more to sooth
0	him with her loved society that now 
0	as with new wine intoxicated both 
0	they swim in mirth and fancy that they feel
0	divinity within them breeding wings 
0	wherewith to scorn the earth but that false fruit
0	far other operation first displayed 
0	carnal desire inflaming he on eve
0	began to cast lascivious eyes she him
0	as wantonly repaid in lust they burn 
0	till adam thus gan eve to dalliance move 
0	eve now i see thou art exact of taste 
0	and elegant of sapience no small part 
0	since to each meaning savour we apply 
0	and palate call judicious i the praise
0	yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed 
0	much pleasure we have lost while we abstained
0	from this delightful fruit nor known till now
0	true relish tasting if such pleasure be
0	in things to us forbidden it might be wished 
0	for this one tree had been forbidden ten 
0	but come so well refreshed now let us play 
0	as meet is after such delicious fare 
0	for never did thy beauty since the day
0	i saw thee first and wedded thee adorned
0	with all perfections so inflame my sense
0	with ardour to enjoy thee fairer now
0	than ever bounty of this virtuous tree 
0	so said he and forbore not glance or toy
0	of amorous intent well understood
0	of eve whose eye darted contagious fire 
0	her hand he seised and to a shady bank 
0	thick over head with verdant roof imbowered 
0	he led her nothing loth flowers were the couch 
0	pansies and violets and asphodel 
0	and hyacinth earth s freshest softest lap 
0	there they their fill of love and love s disport
0	took largely of their mutual guilt the seal 
0	the solace of their sin till dewy sleep
0	oppressed them wearied with their amorous play 
0	soon as the force of that fallacious fruit 
0	that with exhilarating vapour bland
0	about their spirits had played and inmost powers
0	made err was now exhaled and grosser sleep 
0	bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
0	incumbered now had left them up they rose
0	as from unrest and each the other viewing 
0	soon found their eyes how opened and their minds
0	how darkened innocence that as a veil
0	had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone 
0	just confidence and native righteousness 
0	and honour from about them naked left
0	to guilty shame he covered but his robe
0	uncovered more so rose the danite strong 
0	herculean samson from the harlot lap
0	of philistean dalilah and waked
0	shorn of his strength they destitute and bare
0	of all their virtue silent and in face
0	confounded long they sat as strucken mute 
0	till adam though not less than eve abashed 
0	at length gave utterance to these words constrained 
0	o eve in evil hour thou didst give ear
0	to that false worm of whomsoever taught
0	to counterfeit man s voice true in our fall 
0	false in our promised rising since our eyes
0	opened we find indeed and find we know
0	both good and evil good lost and evil got 
0	bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know 
0	which leaves us naked thus of honour void 
0	of innocence of faith of purity 
0	our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained 
0	and in our faces evident the signs
0	of foul concupiscence whence evil store 
0	even shame the last of evils of the first
0	be sure then how shall i behold the face
0	henceforth of god or angel erst with joy
0	and rapture so oft beheld those heavenly shapes
0	will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze
0	insufferably bright o might i here
0	in solitude live savage in some glade
0	obscured where highest woods impenetrable
0	to star or sun light spread their umbrage broad
0	and brown as evening cover me ye pines 
0	ye cedars with innumerable boughs
0	hide me where i may never see them more 
0	but let us now as in bad plight devise
0	what best may for the present serve to hide
0	the parts of each from other that seem most
0	to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen 
0	some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sewed 
0	and girded on our loins may cover round
0	those middle parts that this new comer shame 
0	there sit not and reproach us as unclean 
0	so counselled he and both together went
0	into the thickest wood there soon they chose
0	the fig tree not that kind for fruit renowned 
0	but such as at this day to indians known 
0	in malabar or decan spreads her arms
0	branching so broad and long that in the ground
0	the bended twigs take root and daughters grow
0	about the mother tree a pillared shade
0	high over arched and echoing walks between 
0	there oft the indian herdsman shunning heat 
0	shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds
0	at loop holes cut through thickest shade those leaves
0	they gathered broad as amazonian targe 
0	and with what skill they had together sewed 
0	to gird their waist vain covering if to hide
0	their guilt and dreaded shame o how unlike
0	to that first naked glory such of late
0	columbus found the american so girt
0	with feathered cincture naked else and wild
0	among the trees on isles and woody shores 
0	thus fenced and as they thought their shame in part
0	covered but not at rest or ease of mind 
0	they sat them down to weep nor only tears
0	rained at their eyes but high winds worse within
0	began to rise high passions anger hate 
0	mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore
0	their inward state of mind calm region once
0	and full of peace now tost and turbulent 
0	for understanding ruled not and the will
0	heard not her lore both in subjection now
0	to sensual appetite who from beneath
0	usurping over sovran reason claimed
0	superiour sway from thus distempered breast 
0	adam estranged in look and altered style 
0	speech intermitted thus to eve renewed 
0	would thou hadst hearkened to my words and staid
0	with me as i besought thee when that strange
0	desire of wandering this unhappy morn 
0	i know not whence possessed thee we had then
0	remained still happy not as now despoiled
0	of all our good shamed naked miserable 
0	let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
0	the faith they owe when earnestly they seek
0	such proof conclude they then begin to fail 
0	to whom soon moved with touch of blame thus eve 
0	what words have passed thy lips adam severe 
0	imputest thou that to my default or will
0	of wandering as thou callest it which who knows
0	but might as ill have happened thou being by 
0	or to thyself perhaps hadst thou been there 
0	or here the attempt thou couldst not have discerned
0	fraud in the serpent speaking as he spake 
0	no ground of enmity between us known 
0	why he should mean me ill or seek to harm 
0	was i to have never parted from thy side 
0	as good have grown there still a lifeless rib 
0	being as i am why didst not thou the head 
0	command me absolutely not to go 
0	going into such danger as thou saidst 
0	too facile then thou didst not much gainsay 
0	nay didst permit approve and fair dismiss 
0	hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent 
0	neither had i transgressed nor thou with me 
0	to whom then first incensed adam replied 
0	is this the love is this the recompence
0	of mine to thee ingrateful eve expressed
0	immutable when thou wert lost not i 
0	who might have lived and joyed immortal bliss 
0	yet willingly chose rather death with thee 
0	and am i now upbraided as the cause
0	of thy transgressing not enough severe 
0	it seems in thy restraint what could i more
0	i warned thee i admonished thee foretold
0	the danger and the lurking enemy
0	that lay in wait beyond this had been force 
0	and force upon free will hath here no place 
0	but confidence then bore thee on secure
0	either to meet no danger or to find
0	matter of glorious trial and perhaps
0	i also erred in overmuch admiring
0	what seemed in thee so perfect that i thought
0	no evil durst attempt thee but i rue
0	the errour now which is become my crime 
0	and thou the accuser thus it shall befall
0	him who to worth in women overtrusting 
0	lets her will rule restraint she will not brook 
0	and left to herself if evil thence ensue 
0	she first his weak indulgence will accuse 
0	thus they in mutual accusation spent
0	the fruitless hours but neither self condemning 
0	and of their vain contest appeared no end 
0	mean while the heinous and despiteful act
0	of satan done in paradise and how
0	he in the serpent had perverted eve 
0	her husband she to taste the fatal fruit 
0	was known in heaven for what can scape the eye
0	of god all seeing or deceive his heart
0	omniscient who in all things wise and just 
0	hindered not satan to attempt the mind
0	of man with strength entire and free will armed 
0	complete to have discovered and repulsed
0	whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend 
0	for still they knew and ought to have still remembered 
0	the high injunction not to taste that fruit 
0	whoever tempted which they not obeying 
0	 incurred what could they less the penalty 
0	and manifold in sin deserved to fall 
0	up into heaven from paradise in haste
0	the angelick guards ascended mute and sad 
0	for man for of his state by this they knew 
0	much wondering how the subtle fiend had stolen
0	entrance unseen soon as the unwelcome news
0	from earth arrived at heaven gate displeased
0	all were who heard dim sadness did not spare
0	that time celestial visages yet mixed
0	with pity violated not their bliss 
0	about the new arrived in multitudes
0	the ethereal people ran to hear and know
0	how all befel they towards the throne supreme 
0	accountable made haste to make appear 
0	with righteous plea their utmost vigilance
0	and easily approved when the most high
0	eternal father from his secret cloud 
0	amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice 
0	assembled angels and ye powers returned
0	from unsuccessful charge be not dismayed 
0	nor troubled at these tidings from the earth 
0	which your sincerest care could not prevent 
0	foretold so lately what would come to pass 
0	when first this tempter crossed the gulf from hell 
0	i told ye then he should prevail and speed
0	on his bad errand man should be seduced 
0	and flattered out of all believing lies
0	against his maker no decree of mine
0	concurring to necessitate his fall 
0	or touch with lightest moment of impulse
0	his free will to her own inclining left
0	in even scale but fallen he is and now
0	what rests but that the mortal sentence pass
0	on his transgression death denounced that day 
0	which he presumes already vain and void 
0	because not yet inflicted as he feared 
0	by some immediate stroke but soon shall find
0	forbearance no acquittance ere day end 
0	justice shall not return as bounty scorned 
0	but whom send i to judge them whom but thee 
0	vicegerent son to thee i have transferred
0	all judgement whether in heaven or earth or hell 
0	easy it may be seen that i intend
0	mercy colleague with justice sending thee
0	man s friend his mediator his designed
0	both ransom and redeemer voluntary 
0	and destined man himself to judge man fallen 
0	so spake the father and unfolding bright
0	toward the right hand his glory on the son
0	blazed forth unclouded deity he full
0	resplendent all his father manifest
0	expressed and thus divinely answered mild 
0	father eternal thine is to decree 
0	mine both in heaven and earth to do thy will
0	supreme that thou in me thy son beloved 
0	mayest ever rest well pleased i go to judge
0	on earth these thy transgressours but thou knowest 
0	whoever judged the worst on me must light 
0	when time shall be for so i undertook
0	before thee and not repenting this obtain
0	of right that i may mitigate their doom
0	on me derived yet i shall temper so
0	justice with mercy as may illustrate most
0	them fully satisfied and thee appease 
0	attendance none shall need nor train where none
0	are to behold the judgement but the judged 
0	those two the third best absent is condemned 
0	convict by flight and rebel to all law 
0	conviction to the serpent none belongs 
0	thus saying from his radiant seat he rose
0	of high collateral glory him thrones and powers 
0	princedoms and dominations ministrant 
0	accompanied to heaven gate from whence
0	eden and all the coast in prospect lay 
0	down he descended straight the speed of gods
0	time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged 
0	now was the sun in western cadence low
0	from noon and gentle airs due at their hour 
0	to fan the earth now waked and usher in
0	the evening cool when he from wrath more cool 
0	came the mild judge and intercessour both 
0	to sentence man the voice of god they heard
0	now walking in the garden by soft winds
0	brought to their ears while day declined they heard 
0	and from his presence hid themselves among
0	the thickest trees both man and wife till god 
0	approaching thus to adam called aloud 
0	where art thou adam wont with joy to meet
0	my coming seen far off i miss thee here 
0	not pleased thus entertained with solitude 
0	where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought 
0	or come i less conspicuous or what change
0	absents thee or what chance detains come forth 
0	he came and with him eve more loth though first
0	to offend discountenanced both and discomposed 
0	love was not in their looks either to god 
0	or to each other but apparent guilt 
0	and shame and perturbation and despair 
0	anger and obstinacy and hate and guile 
0	whence adam faltering long thus answered brief 
0	i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
0	afraid being naked hid myself to whom
0	the gracious judge without revile replied 
0	my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not feared 
0	but still rejoiced how is it now become
0	so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who
0	hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree 
0	whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat 
0	to whom thus adam sore beset replied 
0	o heaven in evil strait this day i stand
0	before my judge either to undergo
0	myself the total crime or to accuse
0	my other self the partner of my life 
0	whose failing while her faith to me remains 
0	i should conceal and not expose to blame
0	by my complaint but strict necessity
0	subdues me and calamitous constraint 
0	lest on my head both sin and punishment 
0	however insupportable be all
0	devolved though should i hold my peace yet thou
0	wouldst easily detect what i conceal 
0	this woman whom thou madest to be my help 
0	and gavest me as thy perfect gift so good 
0	so fit so acceptable so divine 
0	that from her hand i could suspect no ill 
0	and what she did whatever in itself 
0	her doing seemed to justify the deed 
0	she gave me of the tree and i did eat 
0	to whom the sovran presence thus replied 
0	was she thy god that her thou didst obey
0	before his voice or was she made thy guide 
0	superiour or but equal that to her
0	thou didst resign thy manhood and the place
0	wherein god set thee above her made of thee 
0	and for thee whose perfection far excelled
0	hers in all real dignity adorned
0	she was indeed and lovely to attract
0	thy love not thy subjection and her gifts
0	were such as under government well seemed 
0	unseemly to bear rule which was thy part
0	and person hadst thou known thyself aright 
0	so having said he thus to eve in few 
0	say woman what is this which thou hast done 
0	to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelmed 
0	confessing soon yet not before her judge
0	bold or loquacious thus abashed replied 
0	the serpent me beguiled and i did eat 
0	which when the lord god heard without delay
0	to judgement he proceeded on the accused
0	serpent though brute unable to transfer
0	the guilt on him who made him instrument
0	of mischief and polluted from the end
0	of his creation justly then accursed 
0	as vitiated in nature more to know
0	concerned not man since he no further knew 
0	nor altered his offence yet god at last
0	to satan first in sin his doom applied 
0	though in mysterious terms judged as then best 
0	and on the serpent thus his curse let fall 
0	because thou hast done this thou art accursed
0	above all cattle each beast of the field 
0	upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go 
0	and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life 
0	between thee and the woman i will put
0	enmity and between thine and her seed 
0	her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel 
0	so spake this oracle then verified
0	when jesus son of mary second eve 
0	saw satan fall like lightning down from heaven 
0	prince of the air then rising from his grave
0	spoiled principalities and powers triumphed
0	in open show and with ascension bright 
0	captivity led captive through the air 
0	the realm itself of satan long usurped 
0	whom he shall tread at last under our feet 
0	even he who now foretold his fatal bruise 
0	and to the woman thus his sentence turned 
0	thy sorrow i will greatly multiply
0	by thy conception children thou shalt bring
0	in sorrow forth and to thy husband s will
0	thine shall submit he over thee shall rule 
0	on adam last thus judgement he pronounced 
0	because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife 
0	and eaten of the tree concerning which
0	i charged thee saying thou shalt not eat thereof 
0	cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
0	shalt eat thereof all the days of thy life 
0	thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
0	unbid and thou shalt eat the herb of the field 
0	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread 
0	till thou return unto the ground for thou
0	out of the ground wast taken know thy birth 
0	for dust thou art and shalt to dust return 
0	so judged he man both judge and saviour sent 
0	and the instant stroke of death denounced that day 
0	removed far off then pitying how they stood
0	before him naked to the air that now
0	must suffer change disdained not to begin
0	thenceforth the form of servant to assume 
0	as when he washed his servants feet so now 
0	as father of his family he clad
0	their nakedness with skins of beasts or slain 
0	or as the snake with youthful coat repaid 
0	and thought not much to clothe his enemies 
0	nor he their outward only with the skins
0	of beasts but inward nakedness much more 
0	opprobrious with his robe of righteousness 
0	arraying covered from his father s sight 
0	to him with swift ascent he up returned 
0	into his blissful bosom reassumed
0	in glory as of old to him appeased
0	all though all knowing what had passed with man
0	recounted mixing intercession sweet 
0	mean while ere thus was sinned and judged on earth 
0	within the gates of hell sat sin and death 
0	in counterview within the gates that now
0	stood open wide belching outrageous flame
0	far into chaos since the fiend passed through 
0	sin opening who thus now to death began 
0	o son why sit we here each other viewing
0	idly while satan our great author thrives
0	in other worlds and happier seat provides
0	for us his offspring dear it cannot be
0	but that success attends him if mishap 
0	ere this he had returned with fury driven
0	by his avengers since no place like this
0	can fit his punishment or their revenge 
0	methinks i feel new strength within me rise 
0	wings growing and dominion given me large
0	beyond this deep whatever draws me on 
0	or sympathy or some connatural force 
0	powerful at greatest distance to unite 
0	with secret amity things of like kind 
0	by secretest conveyance thou my shade
0	inseparable must with me along 
0	for death from sin no power can separate 
0	but lest the difficulty of passing back
0	stay his return perhaps over this gulf
0	impassable impervious let us try
0	adventurous work yet to thy power and mine
0	not unagreeable to found a path
0	over this main from hell to that new world 
0	where satan now prevails a monument
0	of merit high to all the infernal host 
0	easing their passage hence for intercourse 
0	or transmigration as their lot shall lead 
0	nor can i miss the way so strongly drawn
0	by this new felt attraction and instinct 
0	whom thus the meager shadow answered soon 
0	go whither fate and inclination strong 
0	leads thee i shall not lag behind nor err
0	the way thou leading such a scent i draw
0	of carnage prey innumerable and taste
0	the savour of death from all things there that live 
0	nor shall i to the work thou enterprisest
0	be wanting but afford thee equal aid 
0	so saying with delight he snuffed the smell
0	of mortal change on earth as when a flock
0	of ravenous fowl though many a league remote 
0	against the day of battle to a field 
0	where armies lie encamped come flying lured
0	with scent of living carcasses designed
0	for death the following day in bloody fight 
0	so scented the grim feature and upturned
0	his nostril wide into the murky air 
0	sagacious of his quarry from so far 
0	then both from out hell gates into the waste
0	wide anarchy of chaos damp and dark 
0	flew diverse and with power their power was great 
0	hovering upon the waters what they met
0	solid or slimy as in raging sea
0	tost up and down together crouded drove 
0	from each side shoaling towards the mouth of hell 
0	as when two polar winds blowing adverse
0	upon the cronian sea together drive
0	mountains of ice that stop the imagined way
0	beyond petsora eastward to the rich
0	cathaian coast the aggregated soil
0	death with his mace petrifick cold and dry 
0	as with a trident smote and fixed as firm
0	as delos floating once the rest his look
0	bound with gorgonian rigour not to move 
0	and with asphaltick slime broad as the gate 
0	deep to the roots of hell the gathered beach
0	they fastened and the mole immense wrought on
0	over the foaming deep high arched a bridge
0	of length prodigious joining to the wall
0	immoveable of this now fenceless world 
0	forfeit to death from hence a passage broad 
0	smooth easy inoffensive down to hell 
0	so if great things to small may be compared 
0	xerxes the liberty of greece to yoke 
0	from susa his memnonian palace high 
0	came to the sea and over hellespont
0	bridging his way europe with asia joined 
0	and scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves 
0	now had they brought the work by wonderous art
0	pontifical a ridge of pendant rock 
0	over the vexed abyss following the track
0	of satan to the self same place where he
0	first lighted from his wing and landed safe
0	from out of chaos to the outside bare
0	of this round world with pins of adamant
0	and chains they made all fast too fast they made
0	and durable and now in little space
0	the confines met of empyrean heaven 
0	and of this world and on the left hand hell
0	with long reach interposed three several ways
0	in sight to each of these three places led 
0	and now their way to earth they had descried 
0	to paradise first tending when behold 
0	satan in likeness of an angel bright 
0	betwixt the centaur and the scorpion steering
0	his zenith while the sun in aries rose 
0	disguised he came but those his children dear
0	their parent soon discerned though in disguise 
0	he after eve seduced unminded slunk
0	into the wood fast by and changing shape 
0	to observe the sequel saw his guileful act
0	by eve though all unweeting seconded
0	upon her husband saw their shame that sought
0	vain covertures but when he saw descend
0	the son of god to judge them terrified
0	he fled not hoping to escape but shun
0	the present fearing guilty what his wrath
0	might suddenly inflict that past returned
0	by night and listening where the hapless pair
0	sat in their sad discourse and various plaint 
0	thence gathered his own doom which understood
0	not instant but of future time with joy
0	and tidings fraught to hell he now returned 
0	and at the brink of chaos near the foot
0	of this new wonderous pontifice unhoped
0	met who to meet him came his offspring dear 
0	great joy was at their meeting and at sight
0	of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased 
0	long he admiring stood till sin his fair
0	enchanting daughter thus the silence broke 
0	o parent these are thy magnifick deeds 
0	thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own 
0	thou art their author and prime architect 
0	for i no sooner in my heart divined 
0	my heart which by a secret harmony
0	still moves with thine joined in connexion sweet 
0	that thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks
0	now also evidence but straight i felt 
0	though distant from thee worlds between yet felt 
0	that i must after thee with this thy son 
0	such fatal consequence unites us three 
0	hell could no longer hold us in our bounds 
0	nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure
0	detain from following thy illustrious track 
0	thou hast achieved our liberty confined
0	within hell gates till now thou us impowered
0	to fortify thus far and overlay 
0	with this portentous bridge the dark abyss 
0	thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won
0	what thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained
0	with odds what war hath lost and fully avenged
0	our foil in heaven here thou shalt monarch reign 
0	there didst not there let him still victor sway 
0	as battle hath adjudged from this new world
0	retiring by his own doom alienated 
0	and henceforth monarchy with thee divide
0	of all things parted by the empyreal bounds 
0	his quadrature from thy orbicular world 
0	or try thee now more dangerous to his throne 
0	whom thus the prince of darkness answered glad 
0	fair daughter and thou son and grandchild both 
0	high proof ye now have given to be the race
0	of satan for i glory in the name 
0	antagonist of heaven s almighty king 
0	amply have merited of me of all
0	the infernal empire that so near heaven s door
0	triumphal with triumphal act have met 
0	mine with this glorious work and made one realm 
0	hell and this world one realm one continent
0	of easy thorough fare therefore while i
0	descend through darkness on your road with ease 
0	to my associate powers them to acquaint
0	with these successes and with them rejoice 
0	you two this way among these numerous orbs 
0	all yours right down to paradise descend 
0	there dwell and reign in bliss thence on the earth
0	dominion exercise and in the air 
0	chiefly on man sole lord of all declared 
0	him first make sure your thrall and lastly kill 
0	my substitutes i send ye and create
0	plenipotent on earth of matchless might
0	issuing from me on your joint vigour now
0	my hold of this new kingdom all depends 
0	through sin to death exposed by my exploit 
0	if your joint power prevail the affairs of hell
0	no detriment need fear go and be strong 
0	so saying he dismissed them they with speed
0	their course through thickest constellations held 
0	spreading their bane the blasted stars looked wan 
0	and planets planet struck real eclipse
0	then suffered the other way satan went down
0	the causey to hell gate on either side
0	disparted chaos overbuilt exclaimed 
0	and with rebounding surge the bars assailed 
0	that scorned his indignation through the gate 
0	wide open and unguarded satan passed 
0	and all about found desolate for those 
0	appointed to sit there had left their charge 
0	flown to the upper world the rest were all
0	far to the inland retired about the walls
0	of pandemonium city and proud seat
0	of lucifer so by allusion called
0	of that bright star to satan paragoned 
0	there kept their watch the legions while the grand
0	in council sat solicitous what chance
0	might intercept their emperour sent so he
0	departing gave command and they observed 
0	as when the tartar from his russian foe 
0	by astracan over the snowy plains 
0	retires or bactrin sophi from the horns
0	of turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond
0	the realm of aladule in his retreat
0	to tauris or casbeen so these the late
0	heaven banished host left desart utmost hell
0	many a dark league reduced in careful watch
0	round their metropolis and now expecting
0	each hour their great adventurer from the search
0	of foreign worlds he through the midst unmarked 
0	in show plebeian angel militant
0	of lowest order passed and from the door
0	of that plutonian hall invisible
0	ascended his high throne which under state
0	of richest texture spread at the upper end
0	was placed in regal lustre down a while
0	he sat and round about him saw unseen 
0	at last as from a cloud his fulgent head
0	and shape star bright appeared or brighter clad
0	with what permissive glory since his fall
0	was left him or false glitter all amazed
0	at that so sudden blaze the stygian throng
0	bent their aspect and whom they wished beheld 
0	their mighty chief returned loud was the acclaim 
0	forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers 
0	raised from their dark divan and with like joy
0	congratulant approached him who with hand
0	silence and with these words attention won 
0	for in possession such not only of right 
0	i call ye and declare ye now returned
0	successful beyond hope to lead ye forth
0	triumphant out of this infernal pit
0	abominable accursed the house of woe 
0	and dungeon of our tyrant now possess 
0	as lords a spacious world to our native heaven
0	little inferiour by my adventure hard
0	with peril great achieved long were to tell
0	what i have done what suffered with what pain
0	voyaged th unreal vast unbounded deep
0	of horrible confusion over which
0	by sin and death a broad way now is paved 
0	to expedite your glorious march but i
0	toiled out my uncouth passage forced to ride
0	the untractable abyss plunged in the womb
0	of unoriginal night and chaos wild 
0	that jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed
0	my journey strange with clamorous uproar
0	protesting fate supreme thence how i found
0	the new created world which fame in heaven
0	long had foretold a fabrick wonderful
0	of absolute perfection therein man
0	placed in a paradise by our exile
0	made happy him by fraud i have seduced
0	from his creator and the more to encrease
0	your wonder with an apple he thereat
0	offended worth your laughter hath given up
0	both his beloved man and all his world 
0	to sin and death a prey and so to us 
0	without our hazard labour or alarm 
0	to range in and to dwell and over man
0	to rule as over all he should have ruled 
0	true is me also he hath judged or rather
0	me not but the brute serpent in whose shape
0	man i deceived that which to me belongs 
0	is enmity which he will put between
0	me and mankind i am to bruise his heel 
0	his seed when is not set shall bruise my head 
0	a world who would not purchase with a bruise 
0	or much more grievous pain ye have the account
0	of my performance what remains ye gods 
0	but up and enter now into full bliss 
0	so having said a while he stood expecting
0	their universal shout and high applause 
0	to fill his ear when contrary he hears
0	on all sides from innumerable tongues 
0	a dismal universal hiss the sound
0	of publick scorn he wondered but not long
0	had leisure wondering at himself now more 
0	his visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare 
0	his arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining
0	each other till supplanted down he fell
0	a monstrous serpent on his belly prone 
0	reluctant but in vain a greater power
0	now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned 
0	according to his doom he would have spoke 
0	but hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
0	to forked tongue for now were all transformed
0	alike to serpents all as accessories
0	to his bold riot dreadful was the din
0	of hissing through the hall thick swarming now
0	with complicated monsters head and tail 
0	scorpion and asp and amphisbaena dire 
0	cerastes horned hydrus and elops drear 
0	and dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil
0	bedropt with blood of gorgon or the isle
0	ophiusa but still greatest he the midst 
0	now dragon grown larger than whom the sun
0	ingendered in the pythian vale or slime 
0	huge python and his power no less he seemed
0	above the rest still to retain they all
0	him followed issuing forth to the open field 
0	where all yet left of that revolted rout 
0	heaven fallen in station stood or just array 
0	sublime with expectation when to see
0	in triumph issuing forth their glorious chief 
0	they saw but other sight instead a croud
0	of ugly serpents horrour on them fell 
0	and horrid sympathy for what they saw 
0	they felt themselves now changing down their arms 
0	down fell both spear and shield down they as fast 
0	and the dire hiss renewed and the dire form
0	catched by contagion like in punishment 
0	as in their crime thus was the applause they meant 
0	turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame
0	cast on themselves from their own mouths there stood
0	a grove hard by sprung up with this their change 
0	his will who reigns above to aggravate
0	their penance laden with fair fruit like that
0	which grew in paradise the bait of eve
0	used by the tempter on that prospect strange
0	their earnest eyes they fixed imagining
0	for one forbidden tree a multitude
0	now risen to work them further woe or shame 
0	yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce 
0	though to delude them sent could not abstain 
0	but on they rolled in heaps and up the trees
0	climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks
0	that curled megaera greedily they plucked
0	the fruitage fair to sight like that which grew
0	near that bituminous lake where sodom flamed 
0	this more delusive not the touch but taste
0	deceived they fondly thinking to allay
0	their appetite with gust instead of fruit
0	chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste
0	with spattering noise rejected oft they assayed 
0	hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft 
0	with hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws 
0	with soot and cinders filled so oft they fell
0	into the same illusion not as man
0	whom they triumphed once lapsed thus were they plagued
0	and worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss 
0	till their lost shape permitted they resumed 
0	yearly enjoined some say to undergo 
0	this annual humbling certain numbered days 
0	to dash their pride and joy for man seduced 
0	however some tradition they dispersed
0	among the heathen of their purchase got 
0	and fabled how the serpent whom they called
0	ophion with eurynome the wide 
0	encroaching eve perhaps had first the rule
0	of high olympus thence by saturn driven
0	and ops ere yet dictaean jove was born 
0	mean while in paradise the hellish pair
0	too soon arrived sin there in power before 
0	once actual now in body and to dwell
0	habitual habitant behind her death 
0	close following pace for pace not mounted yet
0	on his pale horse to whom sin thus began 
0	second of satan sprung all conquering death 
0	what thinkest thou of our empire now though earned
0	with travel difficult not better far
0	than still at hell s dark threshold to have sat watch 
0	unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved 
0	whom thus the sin born monster answered soon 
0	to me who with eternal famine pine 
0	there best where most with ravine i may meet 
0	which here though plenteous all too little seems
0	to stuff this maw this vast unhide bound corps 
0	to whom the incestuous mother thus replied 
0	thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers 
0	feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl 
0	no homely morsels and whatever thing
0	the sithe of time mows down devour unspared 
0	till i in man residing through the race 
0	his thoughts his looks words actions all infect 
0	and season him thy last and sweetest prey 
0	this said they both betook them several ways 
0	both to destroy or unimmortal make
0	all kinds and for destruction to mature
0	sooner or later which the almighty seeing 
0	from his transcendent seat the saints among 
0	to those bright orders uttered thus his voice 
0	see with what heat these dogs of hell advance
0	to waste and havock yonder world which i
0	so fair and good created and had still
0	kept in that state had not the folly of man
0	let in these wasteful furies who impute
0	folly to me so doth the prince of hell
0	and his adherents that with so much ease
0	i suffer them to enter and possess
0	a place so heavenly and conniving seem
0	to gratify my scornful enemies 
0	that laugh as if transported with some fit
0	of passion i to them had quitted all 
0	at random yielded up to their misrule 
0	and know not that i called and drew them thither 
0	my hell hounds to lick up the draff and filth
0	which man s polluting sin with taint hath shed
0	on what was pure til crammed and gorged nigh burst
0	with sucked and glutted offal at one sling
0	of thy victorious arm well pleasing son 
0	both sin and death and yawning grave at last 
0	through chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of hell
0	for ever and seal up his ravenous jaws 
0	then heaven and earth renewed shall be made pure
0	to sanctity that shall receive no stain 
0	till then the curse pronounced on both precedes 
0	he ended and the heavenly audience loud
0	sung halleluiah as the sound of seas 
0	through multitude that sung just are thy ways 
0	righteous are thy decrees on all thy works 
0	who can extenuate thee next to the son 
0	destined restorer of mankind by whom
0	new heaven and earth shall to the ages rise 
0	or down from heaven descend such was their song 
0	while the creator calling forth by name
0	his mighty angels gave them several charge 
0	as sorted best with present things the sun
0	had first his precept so to move so shine 
0	as might affect the earth with cold and heat
0	scarce tolerable and from the north to call
0	decrepit winter from the south to bring
0	solstitial summer s heat to the blanc moon
0	her office they prescribed to the other five
0	their planetary motions and aspects 
0	in sextile square and trine and opposite 
0	of noxious efficacy and when to join
0	in synod unbenign and taught the fixed
0	their influence malignant when to shower 
0	which of them rising with the sun or falling 
0	should prove tempestuous to the winds they set
0	their corners when with bluster to confound
0	sea air and shore the thunder when to roll
0	with terrour through the dark aereal hall 
0	some say he bid his angels turn ascanse
0	the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more 
0	from the sun s axle they with labour pushed
0	oblique the centrick globe some say the sun
0	was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
0	like distant breadth to taurus with the seven
0	up to the tropick crab thence down amain
0	as deep as capricorn to bring in change
0	of seasons to each clime else had the spring
0	perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers 
0	equal in days and nights except to those
0	beyond the polar circles to them day
0	had unbenighted shone while the low sun 
0	to recompense his distance in their sight
0	had rounded still the horizon and not known
0	or east or west which had forbid the snow
0	from cold estotiland and south as far
0	beneath magellan at that tasted fruit
0	the sun as from thyestean banquet turned
0	his course intended else how had the world
0	inhabited though sinless more than now 
0	avoided pinching cold and scorching heat 
0	these changes in the heavens though slow produced
0	like change on sea and land sideral blast 
0	vapour and mist and exhalation hot 
0	corrupt and pestilent now from the north
0	of norumbega and the samoed shore 
0	bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice 
0	and snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw 
0	boreas and caecias and argestes loud 
0	and thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn 
0	with adverse blast upturns them from the south
0	notus and afer black with thunderous clouds
0	from serraliona thwart of these as fierce 
0	forth rush the levant and the ponent winds 
0	eurus and zephyr with their lateral noise 
0	sirocco and libecchio thus began
0	outrage from lifeless things but discord first 
0	daughter of sin among the irrational
0	death introduced through fierce antipathy 
0	beast now with beast gan war and fowl with fowl 
0	and fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving 
0	devoured each other nor stood much in awe
0	of man but fled him or with countenance grim 
0	glared on him passing these were from without
0	the growing miseries which adam saw
0	already in part though hid in gloomiest shade 
0	to sorrow abandoned but worse felt within 
0	and in a troubled sea of passion tost 
0	thus to disburden sought with sad complaint 
0	o miserable of happy is this the end
0	of this new glorious world and me so late
0	the glory of that glory who now become
0	accursed of blessed hide me from the face
0	of god whom to behold was then my highth
0	of happiness yet well if here would end
0	the misery i deserved it and would bear
0	my own deservings but this will not serve 
0	all that i eat or drink or shall beget 
0	is propagated curse o voice once heard
0	delightfully encrease and multiply 
0	now death to hear for what can i encrease 
0	or multiply but curses on my head 
0	who of all ages to succeed but feeling
0	the evil on him brought by me will curse
0	my head ill fare our ancestor impure 
0	for this we may thank adam but his thanks
0	shall be the execration so besides
0	mine own that bide upon me all from me
0	shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound 
0	on me as on their natural center light
0	heavy though in their place o fleeting joys
0	of paradise dear bought with lasting woes 
0	did i request thee maker from my clay
0	to mould me man did i solicit thee
0	from darkness to promote me or here place
0	in this delicious garden as my will
0	concurred not to my being it were but right
0	and equal to reduce me to my dust 
0	desirous to resign and render back
0	all i received unable to perform
0	thy terms too hard by which i was to hold
0	the good i sought not to the loss of that 
0	sufficient penalty why hast thou added
0	the sense of endless woes inexplicable
0	thy justice seems yet to say truth too late
0	i thus contest then should have been refused
0	those terms whatever when they were proposed 
0	thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good 
0	then cavil the conditions and though god
0	made thee without thy leave what if thy son
0	prove disobedient and reproved retort 
0	 wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not 
0	wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
0	that proud excuse yet him not thy election 
0	but natural necessity begot 
0	god made thee of choice his own and of his own
0	to serve him thy reward was of his grace 
0	thy punishment then justly is at his will 
0	be it so for i submit his doom is fair 
0	that dust i am and shall to dust return 
0	o welcome hour whenever why delays
0	his hand to execute what his decree
0	fixed on this day why do i overlive 
0	why am i mocked with death and lengthened out
0	to deathless pain how gladly would i meet
0	mortality my sentence and be earth
0	insensible how glad would lay me down
0	as in my mother s lap there i should rest 
0	and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
0	would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
0	to me and to my offspring would torment me
0	with cruel expectation yet one doubt
0	pursues me still lest all i cannot die 
0	lest that pure breath of life the spirit of man
0	which god inspired cannot together perish
0	with this corporeal clod then in the grave 
0	or in some other dismal place who knows
0	but i shall die a living death o thought
0	horrid if true yet why it was but breath
0	of life that sinned what dies but what had life
0	and sin the body properly had neither 
0	all of me then shall die let this appease
0	the doubt since human reach no further knows 
0	for though the lord of all be infinite 
0	is his wrath also be it man is not so 
0	but mortal doomed how can he exercise
0	wrath without end on man whom death must end 
0	can he make deathless death that were to make
0	strange contradiction which to god himself
0	impossible is held as argument
0	of weakness not of power will he draw out 
0	for anger s sake finite to infinite 
0	in punished man to satisfy his rigour 
0	satisfied never that were to extend
0	his sentence beyond dust and nature s law 
0	by which all causes else according still
0	to the reception of their matter act 
0	not to the extent of their own sphere but say
0	that death be not one stroke as i supposed 
0	bereaving sense but endless misery
0	from this day onward which i feel begun
0	both in me and without me and so last
0	to perpetuity ay me that fear
0	comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
0	on my defenceless head both death and i
0	am found eternal and incorporate both 
0	nor i on my part single in me all
0	posterity stands cursed fair patrimony
0	that i must leave ye sons o were i able
0	to waste it all myself and leave ye none 
0	so disinherited how would you bless
0	me now your curse ah why should all mankind 
0	for one man s fault thus guiltless be condemned 
0	it guiltless but from me what can proceed 
0	but all corrupt both mind and will depraved
0	not to do only but to will the same
0	with me how can they then acquitted stand
0	in sight of god him after all disputes 
0	forced i absolve all my evasions vain 
0	and reasonings though through mazes lead me still
0	but to my own conviction first and last
0	on me me only as the source and spring
0	of all corruption all the blame lights due 
0	so might the wrath fond wish couldst thou support
0	that burden heavier than the earth to bear 
0	than all the world much heavier though divided
0	with that bad woman thus what thou desirest 
0	and what thou fearest alike destroys all hope
0	of refuge and concludes thee miserable
0	beyond all past example and future 
0	to satan only like both crime and doom 
0	o conscience into what abyss of fears
0	and horrours hast thou driven me out of which
0	i find no way from deep to deeper plunged 
0	thus adam to himself lamented loud 
0	through the still night not now as ere man fell 
0	wholesome and cool and mild but with black air
0	accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom 
0	which to his evil conscience represented
0	all things with double terrour on the ground
0	outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft
0	cursed his creation death as oft accused
0	the day of his offence why comes not death 
0	said he with one thrice acceptable stroke
0	to end me shall truth fail to keep her word 
0	justice divine not hasten to be just 
0	but death comes not at call justice divine
0	mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries 
0	o woods o fountains hillocks dales and bowers 
0	with other echo late i taught your shades
0	to answer and resound far other song 
0	whom thus afflicted when sad eve beheld 
0	desolate where she sat approaching nigh 
0	soft words to his fierce passion she assayed 
0	but her with stern regard he thus repelled 
0	out of my sight thou serpent that name best
0	befits thee with him leagued thyself as false
0	and hateful nothing wants but that thy shape 
0	like his and colour serpentine may show
0	thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
0	henceforth lest that too heavenly form pretended
0	to hellish falshood snare them but for thee
0	i had persisted happy had not thy pride
0	and wandering vanity when least was safe 
0	rejected my forewarning and disdained
0	not to be trusted longing to be seen 
0	though by the devil himself him overweening
0	to over reach but with the serpent meeting 
0	fooled and beguiled by him thou i by thee
0	to trust thee from my side imagined wise 
0	constant mature proof against all assaults 
0	and understood not all was but a show 
0	rather than solid virtue all but a rib
0	crooked by nature bent as now appears 
0	more to the part sinister from me drawn 
0	well if thrown out as supernumerary
0	to my just number found o why did god 
0	creator wise that peopled highest heaven
0	with spirits masculine create at last
0	this novelty on earth this fair defect
0	of nature and not fill the world at once
0	with men as angels without feminine 
0	or find some other way to generate
0	mankind this mischief had not been befallen 
0	and more that shall befall innumerable
0	disturbances on earth through female snares 
0	and strait conjunction with this sex for either
0	he never shall find out fit mate but such
0	as some misfortune brings him or mistake 
0	or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
0	through her perverseness but shall see her gained
0	by a far worse or if she love withheld
0	by parents or his happiest choice too late
0	shall meet already linked and wedlock bound
0	to a fell adversary his hate or shame 
0	which infinite calamity shall cause
0	to human life and houshold peace confound 
0	he added not and from her turned but eve 
0	not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing
0	and tresses all disordered at his feet
0	fell humble and embracing them besought
0	his peace and thus proceeded in her plaint 
0	forsake me not thus adam witness heaven
0	what love sincere and reverence in my heart
0	i bear thee and unweeting have offended 
0	unhappily deceived thy suppliant
0	i beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not 
0	whereon i live thy gentle looks thy aid 
0	thy counsel in this uttermost distress 
0	my only strength and stay forlorn of thee 
0	whither shall i betake me where subsist 
0	while yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps 
0	between us two let there be peace both joining 
0	as joined in injuries one enmity
0	against a foe by doom express assigned us 
0	that cruel serpent on me exercise not
0	thy hatred for this misery befallen 
0	on me already lost me than thyself
0	more miserable both have sinned but thou
0	against god only i against god and thee 
0	and to the place of judgement will return 
0	there with my cries importune heaven that all
0	the sentence from thy head removed may light
0	on me sole cause to thee of all this woe 
0	me me only just object of his ire 
0	she ended weeping and her lowly plight 
0	immoveable till peace obtained from fault
0	acknowledged and deplored in adam wrought
0	commiseration soon his heart relented
0	towards her his life so late and sole delight 
0	now at his feet submissive in distress 
0	creature so fair his reconcilement seeking 
0	his counsel whom she had displeased his aid 
0	as one disarmed his anger all he lost 
0	and thus with peaceful words upraised her soon 
0	unwary and too desirous as before 
0	so now of what thou knowest not who desirest
0	the punishment all on thyself alas 
0	bear thine own first ill able to sustain
0	his full wrath whose thou feelest as yet least part 
0	and my displeasure bearest so ill if prayers
0	could alter high decrees i to that place
0	would speed before thee and be louder heard 
0	that on my head all might be visited 
0	thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven 
0	to me committed and by me exposed 
0	but rise let us no more contend nor blame
0	each other blamed enough elsewhere but strive
0	in offices of love how we may lighten
0	each other s burden in our share of woe 
0	since this day s death denounced if aught i see 
0	will prove no sudden but a slow paced evil 
0	a long day s dying to augment our pain 
0	and to our seed o hapless seed derived 
0	to whom thus eve recovering heart replied 
0	adam by sad experiment i know
0	how little weight my words with thee can find 
0	found so erroneous thence by just event
0	found so unfortunate nevertheless 
0	restored by thee vile as i am to place
0	of new acceptance hopeful to regain
0	thy love the sole contentment of my heart
0	living or dying from thee i will not hide
0	what thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen 
0	tending to some relief of our extremes 
0	or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable 
0	as in our evils and of easier choice 
0	if care of our descent perplex us most 
0	which must be born to certain woe devoured
0	by death at last and miserable it is
0	to be to others cause of misery 
0	our own begotten and of our loins to bring
0	into this cursed world a woeful race 
0	that after wretched life must be at last
0	food for so foul a monster in thy power
0	it lies yet ere conception to prevent
0	the race unblest to being yet unbegot 
0	childless thou art childless remain so death
0	shall be deceived his glut and with us two
0	be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw 
0	but if thou judge it hard and difficult 
0	conversing looking loving to abstain
0	from love s due rights nuptial embraces sweet 
0	and with desire to languish without hope 
0	before the present object languishing
0	with like desire which would be misery
0	and torment less than none of what we dread 
0	then both ourselves and seed at once to free
0	from what we fear for both let us make short 
0	let us seek death or he not found supply
0	with our own hands his office on ourselves 
0	why stand we longer shivering under fears 
0	that show no end but death and have the power 
0	of many ways to die the shortest choosing 
0	destruction with destruction to destroy 
0	she ended here or vehement despair
0	broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts
0	had entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale 
0	but adam with such counsel nothing swayed 
0	to better hopes his more attentive mind
0	labouring had raised and thus to eve replied 
0	eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
0	to argue in thee something more sublime
0	and excellent than what thy mind contemns 
0	but self destruction therefore sought refutes
0	that excellence thought in thee and implies 
0	not thy contempt but anguish and regret
0	for loss of life and pleasure overloved 
0	or if thou covet death as utmost end
0	of misery so thinking to evade
0	the penalty pronounced doubt not but god
0	hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so
0	to be forestalled much more i fear lest death 
0	so snatched will not exempt us from the pain
0	we are by doom to pay rather such acts
0	of contumacy will provoke the highest
0	to make death in us live then let us seek
0	some safer resolution which methinks
0	i have in view calling to mind with heed
0	part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise
0	the serpent s head piteous amends unless
0	be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe 
0	satan who in the serpent hath contrived
0	against us this deceit to crush his head
0	would be revenge indeed which will be lost
0	by death brought on ourselves or childless days
0	resolved as thou proposest so our foe
0	shal scape his punishment ordained and we
0	instead shall double ours upon our heads 
0	no more be mentioned then of violence
0	against ourselves and wilful barrenness 
0	that cuts us off from hope and savours only
0	rancour and pride impatience and despite 
0	reluctance against god and his just yoke
0	laid on our necks remember with what mild
0	and gracious temper he both heard and judged 
0	without wrath or reviling we expected
0	immediate dissolution which we thought
0	was meant by death that day when lo to thee
0	pains only in child bearing were foretold 
0	and bringing forth soon recompensed with joy 
0	fruit of thy womb on me the curse aslope
0	glanced on the ground with labour i must earn
0	my bread what harm idleness had been worse 
0	my labour will sustain me and lest cold
0	or heat should injure us his timely care
0	hath unbesought provided and his hands
0	clothed us unworthy pitying while he judged 
0	how much more if we pray him will his ear
0	be open and his heart to pity incline 
0	and teach us further by what means to shun
0	the inclement seasons rain ice hail and snow 
0	which now the sky with various face begins
0	to show us in this mountain while the winds
0	blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks
0	of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek
0	some better shroud some better warmth to cherish
0	our limbs benummed ere this diurnal star
0	leave cold the night how we his gathered beams
0	reflected may with matter sere foment 
0	or by collision of two bodies grind
0	the air attrite to fire as late the clouds
0	justling or pushed with winds rude in their shock 
0	tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driven down
0	kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine 
0	and sends a comfortable heat from far 
0	which might supply the sun such fire to use 
0	and what may else be remedy or cure
0	to evils which our own misdeeds have wrought 
0	he will instruct us praying and of grace
0	beseeching him so as we need not fear
0	to pass commodiously this life sustained
0	by him with many comforts till we end
0	in dust our final rest and native home 
0	what better can we do than to the place
0	repairing where he judged us prostrate fall
0	before him reverent and there confess
0	humbly our faults and pardon beg with tears
0	watering the ground and with our sighs the air
0	frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
0	of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek 
0	undoubtedly he will relent and turn
0	from his displeasure in whose look serene 
0	when angry most he seemed and most severe 
0	what else but favour grace and mercy shone 
0	so spake our father penitent nor eve
0	felt less remorse they forthwith to the place
0	repairing where he judged them prostrate fell
0	before him reverent and both confessed
0	humbly their faults and pardon begged with tears
0	watering the ground and with their sighs the air
0	frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
0	of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek 
0	thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
0	praying for from the mercy seat above
0	prevenient grace descending had removed
0	the stony from their hearts and made new flesh
0	regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed
0	unutterable which the spirit of prayer
0	inspired and winged for heaven with speedier flight
0	than loudest oratory yet their port
0	not of mean suitors nor important less
0	seemed their petition than when the ancient pair
0	in fables old less ancient yet than these 
0	deucalion and chaste pyrrha to restore
0	the race of mankind drowned before the shrine
0	of themis stood devout to heaven their prayers
0	flew up nor missed the way by envious winds
0	blown vagabond or frustrate in they passed
0	dimensionless through heavenly doors then clad
0	with incense where the golden altar fumed 
0	by their great intercessour came in sight
0	before the father s throne them the glad son
0	presenting thus to intercede began 
0	see father what first fruits on earth are sprung
0	from thy implanted grace in man these sighs
0	and prayers which in this golden censer mixed
0	with incense i thy priest before thee bring 
0	fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed
0	sown with contrition in his heart than those
0	which his own hand manuring all the trees
0	of paradise could have produced ere fallen
0	from innocence now therefore bend thine ear
0	to supplication hear his sighs though mute 
0	unskilful with what words to pray let me
0	interpret for him me his advocate
0	and propitiation all his works on me 
0	good or not good ingraft my merit those
0	shall perfect and for these my death shall pay 
0	accept me and in me from these receive
0	the smell of peace toward mankind let him live
0	before thee reconciled at least his days
0	numbered though sad till death his doom which i
0	to mitigate thus plead not to reverse 
0	to better life shall yield him where with me
0	all my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss 
0	made one with me as i with thee am one 
0	to whom the father without cloud serene 
0	all thy request for man accepted son 
0	obtain all thy request was my decree 
0	but longer in that paradise to dwell 
0	the law i gave to nature him forbids 
0	those pure immortal elements that know 
0	no gross no unharmonious mixture foul 
0	eject him tainted now and purge him off 
0	as a distemper gross to air as gross 
0	and mortal food as may dispose him best
0	for dissolution wrought by sin that first
0	distempered all things and of incorrupt
0	corrupted i at first with two fair gifts
0	created him endowed with happiness 
0	and immortality that fondly lost 
0	this other served but to eternize woe 
0	till i provided death so death becomes
0	his final remedy and after life 
0	tried in sharp tribulation and refined
0	by faith and faithful works to second life 
0	waked in the renovation of the just 
0	resigns him up with heaven and earth renewed 
0	but let us call to synod all the blest 
0	through heaven s wide bounds from them i will not hide
0	my judgements how with mankind i proceed 
0	as how with peccant angels late they saw 
0	and in their state though firm stood more confirmed 
0	he ended and the son gave signal high
0	to the bright minister that watched he blew
0	his trumpet heard in oreb since perhaps
0	when god descended and perhaps once more
0	to sound at general doom the angelick blast
0	filled all the regions from their blisful bowers
0	of amarantine shade fountain or spring 
0	by the waters of life where er they sat
0	in fellowships of joy the sons of light
0	hasted resorting to the summons high 
0	and took their seats till from his throne supreme
0	the almighty thus pronounced his sovran will 
0	o sons like one of us man is become
0	to know both good and evil since his taste
0	of that defended fruit but let him boast
0	his knowledge of good lost and evil got 
0	happier had it sufficed him to have known
0	good by itself and evil not at all 
0	he sorrows now repents and prays contrite 
0	my motions in him longer than they move 
0	his heart i know how variable and vain 
0	self left lest therefore his now bolder hand
0	reach also of the tree of life and eat 
0	and live for ever dream at least to live
0	for ever to remove him i decree 
0	and send him from the garden forth to till
0	the ground whence he was taken fitter soil 
0	michael this my behest have thou in charge 
0	take to thee from among the cherubim
0	thy choice of flaming warriours lest the fiend 
0	or in behalf of man or to invade
0	vacant possession some new trouble raise 
0	haste thee and from the paradise of god
0	without remorse drive out the sinful pair 
0	from hallowed ground the unholy and denounce
0	to them and to their progeny from thence
0	perpetual banishment yet lest they faint
0	at the sad sentence rigorously urged 
0	 for i behold them softened and with tears
0	bewailing their excess all terrour hide 
0	if patiently thy bidding they obey 
0	dismiss them not disconsolate reveal
0	to adam what shall come in future days 
0	as i shall thee enlighten intermix
0	my covenant in the woman s seed renewed 
0	so send them forth though sorrowing yet in peace 
0	and on the east side of the garden place 
0	where entrance up from eden easiest climbs 
0	cherubick watch and of a sword the flame
0	wide waving all approach far off to fright 
0	and guard all passage to the tree of life 
0	lest paradise a receptacle prove
0	to spirits foul and all my trees their prey 
0	with whose stolen fruit man once more to delude 
0	he ceased and the arch angelick power prepared
0	for swift descent with him the cohort bright
0	of watchful cherubim four faces each
0	had like a double janus all their shape
0	spangled with eyes more numerous than those
0	of argus and more wakeful than to drouse 
0	charmed with arcadian pipe the pastoral reed
0	of hermes or his opiate rod mean while 
0	to re salute the world with sacred light 
0	leucothea waked and with fresh dews imbalmed
0	the earth when adam and first matron eve
0	had ended now their orisons and found
0	strength added from above new hope to spring
0	out of despair joy but with fear yet linked 
0	which thus to eve his welcome words renewed 
0	eve easily my faith admit that all
0	the good which we enjoy from heaven descends 
0	but that from us aught should ascend to heaven
0	so prevalent as to concern the mind
0	of god high blest or to incline his will 
0	hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer
0	or one short sigh of human breath upborne
0	even to the seat of god for since i sought
0	by prayer the offended deity to appease 
0	kneeled and before him humbled all my heart 
0	methought i saw him placable and mild 
0	bending his ear persuasion in me grew
0	that i was heard with favour peace returned
0	home to my breast and to my memory
0	his promise that thy seed shall bruise our foe 
0	which then not minded in dismay yet now
0	assures me that the bitterness of death
0	is past and we shall live whence hail to thee 
0	eve rightly called mother of all mankind 
0	mother of all things living since by thee
0	man is to live and all things live for man 
0	to whom thus eve with sad demeanour meek 
0	ill worthy i such title should belong
0	to me transgressour who for thee ordained
0	a help became thy snare to me reproach
0	rather belongs distrust and all dispraise 
0	but infinite in pardon was my judge 
0	that i who first brought death on all am graced
0	the source of life next favourable thou 
0	who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf st 
0	far other name deserving but the field
0	to labour calls us now with sweat imposed 
0	though after sleepless night for see the morn 
0	all unconcerned with our unrest begins
0	her rosy progress smiling let us forth 
0	i never from thy side henceforth to stray 
0	where er our day s work lies though now enjoined
0	laborious till day droop while here we dwell 
0	what can be toilsome in these pleasant walks 
0	here let us live though in fallen state content 
0	so spake so wished much humbled eve but fate
0	subscribed not nature first gave signs impressed
0	on bird beast air air suddenly eclipsed 
0	after short blush of morn nigh in her sight
0	the bird of jove stooped from his aery tour 
0	two birds of gayest plume before him drove 
0	down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods 
0	first hunter then pursued a gentle brace 
0	goodliest of all the forest hart and hind 
0	direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight 
0	adam observed and with his eye the chase
0	pursuing not unmoved to eve thus spake 
0	o eve some further change awaits us nigh 
0	which heaven by these mute signs in nature shows
0	forerunners of his purpose or to warn
0	us haply too secure of our discharge
0	from penalty because from death released
0	some days how long and what till then our life 
0	who knows or more than this that we are dust 
0	and thither must return and be no more 
0	why else this double object in our sight
0	of flight pursued in the air and o er the ground 
0	one way the self same hour why in the east
0	darkness ere day s mid course and morning light
0	more orient in yon western cloud that draws
0	o er the blue firmament a radiant white 
0	and slow descends with something heavenly fraught 
0	he erred not for by this the heavenly bands
0	down from a sky of jasper lighted now
0	in paradise and on a hill made halt 
0	a glorious apparition had not doubt
0	and carnal fear that day dimmed adam s eye 
0	not that more glorious when the angels met
0	jacob in mahanaim where he saw
0	the field pavilioned with his guardians bright 
0	nor that which on the flaming mount appeared
0	in dothan covered with a camp of fire 
0	against the syrian king who to surprise
0	one man assassin like had levied war 
0	war unproclaimed the princely hierarch
0	in their bright stand there left his powers to seise
0	possession of the garden he alone 
0	to find where adam sheltered took his way 
0	not unperceived of adam who to eve 
0	while the great visitant approached thus spake 
0	eve now expect great tidings which perhaps
0	of us will soon determine or impose
0	new laws to be observed for i descry 
0	from yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill 
0	one of the heavenly host and by his gait 
0	none of the meanest some great potentate
0	or of the thrones above such majesty
0	invests him coming yet not terrible 
0	that i should fear nor sociably mild 
0	as raphael that i should much confide 
0	but solemn and sublime whom not to offend 
0	with reverence i must meet and thou retire 
0	he ended and the arch angel soon drew nigh 
0	not in his shape celestial but as man
0	clad to meet man over his lucid arms
0	a military vest of purple flowed 
0	livelier than meliboean or the grain
0	of sarra worn by kings and heroes old
0	in time of truce iris had dipt the woof 
0	his starry helm unbuckled showed him prime
0	in manhood where youth ended by his side 
0	as in a glistering zodiack hung the sword 
0	satan s dire dread and in his hand the spear 
0	adam bowed low he kingly from his state
0	inclined not but his coming thus declared 
0	adam heaven s high behest no preface needs 
0	sufficient that thy prayers are heard and death 
0	then due by sentence when thou didst transgress 
0	defeated of his seisure many days
0	given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent 
0	and one bad act with many deeds well done
0	mayest cover well may then thy lord appeased 
0	redeem thee quite from death s rapacious claim 
0	but longer in this paradise to dwell
0	permits not to remove thee i am come 
0	and send thee from the garden forth to till
0	the ground whence thou wast taken fitter soil 
0	he added not for adam at the news
0	heart struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood 
0	that all his senses bound eve who unseen
0	yet all had heard with audible lament
0	discovered soon the place of her retire 
0	o unexpected stroke worse than of death 
0	must i thus leave thee paradise thus leave
0	thee native soil these happy walks and shades 
0	fit haunt of gods where i had hope to spend 
0	quiet though sad the respite of that day
0	that must be mortal to us both o flowers 
0	that never will in other climate grow 
0	my early visitation and my last
0	at even which i bred up with tender hand
0	from the first opening bud and gave ye names 
0	who now shall rear ye to the sun or rank
0	your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount 
0	thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned
0	with what to sight or smell was sweet from thee
0	how shall i part and whither wander down
0	into a lower world to this obscure
0	and wild how shall we breathe in other air
0	less pure accustomed to immortal fruits 
0	whom thus the angel interrupted mild 
0	lament not eve but patiently resign
0	what justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart 
0	thus over fond on that which is not thine 
0	thy going is not lonely with thee goes
0	thy husband whom to follow thou art bound 
0	where he abides think there thy native soil 
0	adam by this from the cold sudden damp
0	recovering and his scattered spirits returned 
0	to michael thus his humble words addressed 
0	celestial whether among the thrones or named
0	of them the highest for such of shape may seem
0	prince above princes gently hast thou told
0	thy message which might else in telling wound 
0	and in performing end us what besides
0	of sorrow and dejection and despair 
0	our frailty can sustain thy tidings bring 
0	departure from this happy place our sweet
0	recess and only consolation left
0	familiar to our eyes all places else
0	inhospitable appear and desolate 
0	nor knowing us nor known and if by prayer
0	incessant i could hope to change the will
0	of him who all things can i would not cease
0	to weary him with my assiduous cries 
0	but prayer against his absolute decree
0	no more avails than breath against the wind 
0	blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth 
0	therefore to his great bidding i submit 
0	this most afflicts me that departing hence 
0	as from his face i shall be hid deprived
0	his blessed countenance here i could frequent
0	with worship place by place where he vouchsafed
0	presence divine and to my sons relate 
0	on this mount he appeared under this tree
0	stood visible among these pines his voice
0	i heard here with him at this fountain talked 
0	so many grateful altars i would rear
0	of grassy turf and pile up every stone
0	of lustre from the brook in memory 
0	or monument to ages and theron
0	offer sweet smelling gums and fruits and flowers 
0	in yonder nether world where shall i seek
0	his bright appearances or foot step trace 
0	for though i fled him angry yet recalled
0	to life prolonged and promised race i now
0	gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
0	of glory and far off his steps adore 
0	to whom thus michael with regard benign 
0	adam thou knowest heaven his and all the earth 
0	not this rock only his omnipresence fills
0	land sea and air and every kind that lives 
0	fomented by his virtual power and warmed 
0	all the earth he gave thee to possess and rule 
0	no despicable gift surmise not then
0	his presence to these narrow bounds confined
0	of paradise or eden this had been
0	perhaps thy capital seat from whence had spread
0	all generations and had hither come
0	from all the ends of the earth to celebrate
0	and reverence thee their great progenitor 
0	but this pre eminence thou hast lost brought down
0	to dwell on even ground now with thy sons 
0	yet doubt not but in valley and in plain 
0	god is as here and will be found alike
0	present and of his presence many a sign
0	still following thee still compassing thee round
0	with goodness and paternal love his face
0	express and of his steps the track divine 
0	which that thou mayest believe and be confirmed
0	ere thou from hence depart know i am sent
0	to show thee what shall come in future days
0	to thee and to thy offspring good with bad
0	expect to hear supernal grace contending
0	with sinfulness of men thereby to learn
0	true patience and to temper joy with fear
0	and pious sorrow equally inured
0	by moderation either state to bear 
0	prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead
0	safest thy life and best prepared endure
0	thy mortal passage when it comes ascend
0	this hill let eve for i have drenched her eyes 
0	here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest 
0	as once thou sleptst while she to life was formed 
0	to whom thus adam gratefully replied 
0	ascend i follow thee safe guide the path
0	thou leadest me and to the hand of heaven submit 
0	however chastening to the evil turn
0	my obvious breast arming to overcome
0	by suffering and earn rest from labour won 
0	if so i may attain so both ascend
0	in the visions of god it was a hill 
0	of paradise the highest from whose top
0	the hemisphere of earth in clearest ken 
0	stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay 
0	not higher that hill nor wider looking round 
0	whereon for different cause the tempter set
0	our second adam in the wilderness 
0	to show him all earth s kingdoms and their glory 
0	his eye might there command wherever stood
0	city of old or modern fame the seat
0	of mightiest empire from the destined walls
0	of cambalu seat of cathaian can 
0	and samarchand by oxus temir s throne 
0	to paquin of sinaean kings and thence
0	to agra and lahor of great mogul 
0	down to the golden chersonese or where
0	the persian in ecbatan sat or since
0	in hispahan or where the russian ksar
0	turchestan born nor could his eye not ken
0	the empire of negus to his utmost port
0	ercoco and the less maritim kings
0	and sofala thought ophir to the realm
0	of congo and angola farthest south 
0	or thence from niger flood to atlas mount
0	the kingdoms of almansor fez and sus 
0	on europe thence and where rome was to sway
0	the world in spirit perhaps he also saw
0	rich mexico the seat of montezume 
0	and cusco in peru the richer seat
0	of atabalipa and yet unspoiled
0	guiana whose great city geryon s sons
0	call el dorado but to nobler sights
0	michael from adam s eyes the film removed 
0	which that false fruit that promised clearer sight
0	had bred then purged with euphrasy and rue
0	the visual nerve for he had much to see 
0	and from the well of life three drops instilled 
0	so deep the power of these ingredients pierced 
0	even to the inmost seat of mental sight 
0	that adam now enforced to close his eyes 
0	sunk down and all his spirits became entranced 
0	but him the gentle angel by the hand
0	soon raised and his attention thus recalled 
0	adam now ope thine eyes and first behold
0	the effects which thy original crime hath wrought
0	in some to spring from thee who never touched
0	the excepted tree nor with the snake conspired 
0	nor sinned thy sin yet from that sin derive
0	corruption to bring forth more violent deeds 
0	his eyes he opened and beheld a field 
0	part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves
0	new reaped the other part sheep walks and folds 
0	i the midst an altar as the land mark stood 
0	rustick of grassy sord thither anon
0	a sweaty reaper from his tillage brought
0	first fruits the green ear and the yellow sheaf 
0	unculled as came to hand a shepherd next 
0	more meek came with the firstlings of his flock 
0	choicest and best then sacrificing laid
0	the inwards and their fat with incense strowed 
0	on the cleft wood and all due rights performed 
0	his offering soon propitious fire from heaven
0	consumed with nimble glance and grateful steam 
0	the other s not for his was not sincere 
0	whereat he inly raged and as they talked 
0	smote him into the midriff with a stone
0	that beat out life he fell and deadly pale 
0	groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused 
0	much at that sight was adam in his heart
0	dismayed and thus in haste to the angel cried 
0	o teacher some great mischief hath befallen
0	to that meek man who well had sacrificed 
0	is piety thus and pure devotion paid 
0	to whom michael thus he also moved replied 
0	these two are brethren adam and to come
0	out of thy loins the unjust the just hath slain 
0	for envy that his brother s offering found
0	from heaven acceptance but the bloody fact
0	will be avenged and the other s faith approved 
0	lose no reward though here thou see him die 
0	rolling in dust and gore to which our sire 
0	alas both for the deed and for the cause 
0	but have i now seen death is this the way
0	i must return to native dust o sight
0	of terrour foul and ugly to behold 
0	horrid to think how horrible to feel 
0	to whom thus michael death thou hast seen
0	in his first shape on man but many shapes
0	of death and many are the ways that lead
0	to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense
0	more terrible at the entrance than within 
0	some as thou sawest by violent stroke shall die 
0	by fire flood famine by intemperance more
0	in meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring
0	diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
0	before thee shall appear that thou mayest know
0	what misery the inabstinence of eve
0	shall bring on men immediately a place
0	before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark 
0	a lazar house it seemed wherein were laid
0	numbers of all diseased all maladies
0	of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms
0	of heart sick agony all feverous kinds 
0	convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs 
0	intestine stone and ulcer colick pangs 
0	demoniack phrenzy moaping melancholy 
0	and moon struck madness pining atrophy 
0	marasmus and wide wasting pestilence 
0	dropsies and asthmas and joint racking rheums 
0	dire was the tossing deep the groans despair
0	tended the sick busiest from couch to couch 
0	and over them triumphant death his dart
0	shook but delayed to strike though oft invoked
0	with vows as their chief good and final hope 
0	sight so deform what heart of rock could long
0	dry eyed behold adam could not but wept 
0	though not of woman born compassion quelled
0	his best of man and gave him up to tears
0	a space till firmer thoughts restrained excess 
0	and scarce recovering words his plaint renewed 
0	o miserable mankind to what fall
0	degraded to what wretched state reserved 
0	better end here unborn why is life given
0	to be thus wrested from us rather why
0	obtruded on us thus who if we knew
0	what we receive would either no accept
0	life offered or soon beg to lay it down 
0	glad to be so dismissed in peace can thus
0	the image of god in man created once
0	so goodly and erect though faulty since 
0	to such unsightly sufferings be debased
0	under inhuman pains why should not man 
0	retaining still divine similitude
0	in part from such deformities be free 
0	and for his maker s image sake exempt 
0	their maker s image answered michael then
0	forsook them when themselves they vilified
0	to serve ungoverned appetite and took
0	his image whom they served a brutish vice 
0	inductive mainly to the sin of eve 
0	therefore so abject is their punishment 
0	disfiguring not god s likeness but their own 
0	or if his likeness by themselves defaced 
0	while they pervert pure nature s healthful rules
0	to loathsome sickness worthily since they
0	god s image did not reverence in themselves 
0	i yield it just said adam and submit 
0	but is there yet no other way besides
0	these painful passages how we may come
0	to death and mix with our connatural dust 
0	there is said michael if thou well observe
0	the rule of not too much by temperance taught 
0	in what thou eatest and drinkest seeking from thence
0	due nourishment not gluttonous delight 
0	till many years over thy head return 
0	so mayest thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop
0	into thy mother s lap or be with ease
0	gathered nor harshly plucked for death mature 
0	this is old age but then thou must outlive
0	thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change
0	to withered weak and gray thy senses then 
0	obtuse all taste of pleasure must forego 
0	to what thou hast and for the air of youth 
0	hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reign
0	a melancholy damp of cold and dry
0	to weigh thy spirits down and last consume
0	the balm of life to whom our ancestor 
0	henceforth i fly not death nor would prolong
0	life much bent rather how i may be quit 
0	fairest and easiest of this cumbrous charge 
0	which i must keep till my appointed day
0	of rendering up and patiently attend
0	my dissolution michael replied 
0	nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livest
0	live well how long or short permit to heaven 
0	and now prepare thee for another sight 
0	he looked and saw a spacious plain whereon
0	were tents of various hue by some were herds
0	of cattle grazing others whence the sound
0	of instruments that made melodious chime 
0	was heard of harp and organ and who moved
0	their stops and chords was seen his volant touch 
0	instinct through all proportions low and high 
0	fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue 
0	in other part stood one who at the forge
0	labouring two massy clods of iron and brass
0	had melted whether found where casual fire
0	had wasted woods on mountain or in vale 
0	down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot
0	to some cave s mouth or whether washed by stream
0	from underground the liquid ore he drained
0	into fit moulds prepared from which he formed
0	first his own tools then what might else be wrought
0	fusil or graven in metal after these 
0	but on the hither side a different sort
0	from the high neighbouring hills which was their seat 
0	down to the plain descended by their guise
0	just men they seemed and all their study bent
0	to worship god aright and know his works
0	not hid nor those things last which might preserve
0	freedom and peace to men they on the plain
0	long had not walked when from the tents behold 
0	a bevy of fair women richly gay
0	in gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung
0	soft amorous ditties and in dance came on 
0	the men though grave eyed them and let their eyes
0	rove without rein till in the amorous net
0	fast caught they liked and each his liking chose 
0	and now of love they treat till the evening star 
0	love s harbinger appeared then all in heat
0	they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke
0	hymen then first to marriage rites invoked 
0	with feast and musick all the tents resound 
0	such happy interview and fair event
0	of love and youth not lost songs garlands flowers 
0	and charming symphonies attached the heart
0	of adam soon inclined to admit delight 
0	the bent of nature which he thus expressed 
0	true opener of mine eyes prime angel blest 
0	much better seems this vision and more hope
0	of peaceful days portends than those two past 
0	those were of hate and death or pain much worse 
0	here nature seems fulfilled in all her ends 
0	to whom thus michael judge not what is best
0	by pleasure though to nature seeming meet 
0	created as thou art to nobler end
0	holy and pure conformity divine 
0	those tents thou sawest so pleasant were the tents
0	of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race
0	who slew his brother studious they appear
0	of arts that polish life inventers rare 
0	unmindful of their maker though his spirit
0	taught them but they his gifts acknowledged none 
0	yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget 
0	for that fair female troop thou sawest that seemed
0	of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay 
0	yet empty of all good wherein consists
0	woman s domestick honour and chief praise 
0	bred only and completed to the taste
0	of lustful appetence to sing to dance 
0	to dress and troll the tongue and roll the eye 
0	to these that sober race of men whose lives
0	religious titled them the sons of god 
0	shall yield up all their virtue all their fame
0	ignobly to the trains and to the smiles
0	of these fair atheists and now swim in joy 
0	erelong to swim at large and laugh for which
0	the world erelong a world of tears must weep 
0	to whom thus adam of short joy bereft 
0	o pity and shame that they who to live well
0	entered so fair should turn aside to tread
0	paths indirect or in the mid way faint 
0	but still i see the tenour of man s woe
0	holds on the same from woman to begin 
0	from man s effeminate slackness it begins 
0	said the angel who should better hold his place
0	by wisdom and superiour gifts received 
0	but now prepare thee for another scene 
0	he looked and saw wide territory spread
0	before him towns and rural works between 
0	cities of men with lofty gates and towers 
0	concourse in arms fierce faces threatening war 
0	giants of mighty bone and bold emprise 
0	part wield their arms part curb the foaming steed 
0	single or in array of battle ranged
0	both horse and foot nor idly mustering stood 
0	one way a band select from forage drives
0	a herd of beeves fair oxen and fair kine 
0	from a fat meadow ground or fleecy flock 
0	ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain 
0	their booty scarce with life the shepherds fly 
0	but call in aid which makes a bloody fray 
0	with cruel tournament the squadrons join 
0	where cattle pastured late now scattered lies
0	with carcasses and arms the ensanguined field 
0	deserted others to a city strong
0	lay siege encamped by battery scale and mine 
0	assaulting others from the wall defend
0	with dart and javelin stones and sulphurous fire 
0	on each hand slaughter and gigantick deeds 
0	in other part the sceptered heralds call
0	to council in the city gates anon
0	gray headed men and grave with warriours mixed 
0	assemble and harangues are heard but soon 
0	in factious opposition till at last 
0	of middle age one rising eminent
0	in wise deport spake much of right and wrong 
0	of justice or religion truth and peace 
0	and judgement from above him old and young
0	exploded and had seized with violent hands 
0	had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
0	unseen amid the throng so violence
0	proceeded and oppression and sword law 
0	through all the plain and refuge none was found 
0	adam was all in tears and to his guide
0	lamenting turned full sad o what are these 
0	death s ministers not men who thus deal death
0	inhumanly to men and multiply
0	ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
0	his brother for of whom such massacre
0	make they but of their brethren men of men
0	but who was that just man whom had not heaven
0	rescued had in his righteousness been lost 
0	to whom thus michael these are the product
0	of those ill mated marriages thou sawest 
0	where good with bad were matched who of themselves
0	abhor to join and by imprudence mixed 
0	produce prodigious births of body or mind 
0	such were these giants men of high renown 
0	for in those days might only shall be admired 
0	and valour and heroick virtue called 
0	to overcome in battle and subdue
0	nations and bring home spoils with infinite
0	man slaughter shall be held the highest pitch
0	of human glory and for glory done
0	of triumph to be styled great conquerours
0	patrons of mankind gods and sons of gods 
0	destroyers rightlier called and plagues of men 
0	thus fame shall be achieved renown on earth 
0	and what most merits fame in silence hid 
0	but he the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst
0	the only righteous in a world preverse 
0	and therefore hated therefore so beset
0	with foes for daring single to be just 
0	and utter odious truth that god would come
0	to judge them with his saints him the most high
0	rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
0	did as thou sawest receive to walk with god
0	high in salvation and the climes of bliss 
0	exempt from death to show thee what reward
0	awaits the good the rest what punishment 
0	which now direct thine eyes and soon behold 
0	he looked and saw the face of things quite changed 
0	the brazen throat of war had ceased to roar 
0	all now was turned to jollity and game 
0	to luxury and riot feast and dance 
0	marrying or prostituting as befel 
0	rape or adultery where passing fair
0	allured them thence from cups to civil broils 
0	at length a reverend sire among them came 
0	and of their doings great dislike declared 
0	and testified against their ways he oft
0	frequented their assemblies whereso met 
0	triumphs or festivals and to them preached
0	conversion and repentance as to souls
0	in prison under judgements imminent 
0	but all in vain which when he saw he ceased
0	contending and removed his tents far off 
0	then from the mountain hewing timber tall 
0	began to build a vessel of huge bulk 
0	measured by cubit length and breadth and highth 
0	smeared round with pitch and in the side a door
0	contrived and of provisions laid in large 
0	for man and beast when lo a wonder strange 
0	of every beast and bird and insect small 
0	came sevens and pairs and entered in as taught
0	their order last the sire and his three sons 
0	with their four wives and god made fast the door 
0	mean while the south wind rose and with black wings
0	wide hovering all the clouds together drove
0	from under heaven the hills to their supply
0	vapour and exhalation dusk and moist 
0	sent up amain and now the thickened sky
0	like a dark ceiling stood down rushed the rain
0	impetuous and continued till the earth
0	no more was seen the floating vessel swum
0	uplifted and secure with beaked prow
0	rode tilting o er the waves all dwellings else
0	flood overwhelmed and them with all their pomp
0	deep under water rolled sea covered sea 
0	sea without shore and in their palaces 
0	where luxury late reigned sea monsters whelped
0	and stabled of mankind so numerous late 
0	all left in one small bottom swum imbarked 
0	how didst thou grieve then adam to behold
0	the end of all thy offspring end so sad 
0	depopulation thee another flood 
0	of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned 
0	and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reared
0	by the angel on thy feet thou stoodest at last 
0	though comfortless as when a father mourns
0	his children all in view destroyed at once 
0	and scarce to the angel utter dst thus thy plaint 
0	o visions ill foreseen better had i
0	lived ignorant of future so had borne
0	my part of evil only each day s lot
0	enough to bear those now that were dispensed
0	the burden of many ages on me light
0	at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth
0	abortive to torment me ere their being 
0	with thought that they must be let no man seek
0	henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
0	him or his children evil he may be sure 
0	which neither his foreknowing can prevent 
0	and he the future evil shall no less
0	in apprehension than in substance feel 
0	grievous to bear but that care now is past 
0	man is not whom to warn those few escaped
0	famine and anguish will at last consume 
0	wandering that watery desart i had hope 
0	when violence was ceased and war on earth 
0	all would have then gone well peace would have crowned
0	with length of happy days the race of man 
0	but i was far deceived for now i see
0	peace to corrupt no less than war to waste 
0	how comes it thus unfold celestial guide 
0	and whether here the race of man will end 
0	to whom thus michael those whom last thou sawest
0	in triumph and luxurious wealth are they
0	first seen in acts of prowess eminent
0	and great exploits but of true virtue void 
0	who having spilt much blood and done much wast
0	subduing nations and achieved thereby
0	fame in the world high titles and rich prey 
0	shall change their course to pleasure ease and sloth 
0	surfeit and lust till wantonness and pride
0	raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace 
0	the conquered also and enslaved by war 
0	shall with their freedom lost all virtue lose
0	and fear of god from whom their piety feigned
0	in sharp contest of battle found no aid
0	against invaders therefore cooled in zeal 
0	thenceforth shall practice how to live secure 
0	worldly or dissolute on what their lords
0	shall leave them to enjoy for the earth shall bear
0	more than enough that temperance may be tried 
0	so all shall turn degenerate all depraved 
0	justice and temperance truth and faith forgot 
0	one man except the only son of light
0	in a dark age against example good 
0	against allurement custom and a world
0	offended fearless of reproach and scorn 
0	or violence he of their wicked ways
0	shall them admonish and before them set
0	the paths of righteousness how much more safe
0	and full of peace denouncing wrath to come
0	on their impenitence and shall return
0	of them derided but of god observed
0	the one just man alive by his command
0	shall build a wonderous ark as thou beheldst 
0	to save himself and houshold from amidst
0	a world devote to universal wrack 
0	no sooner he with them of man and beast
0	select for life shall in the ark be lodged 
0	and sheltered round but all the cataracts
0	of heaven set open on the earth shall pour
0	rain day and night all fountains of the deep 
0	broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp
0	beyond all bounds till inundation rise
0	above the highest hills then shall this mount
0	of paradise by might of waves be moved
0	out of his place pushed by the horned flood 
0	with all his verdure spoiled and trees adrift 
0	down the great river to the opening gulf 
0	and there take root an island salt and bare 
0	the haunt of seals and orcs and sea mews clang 
0	to teach thee that god attributes to place
0	no sanctity if none be thither brought
0	by men who there frequent or therein dwell 
0	and now what further shall ensue behold 
0	he looked and saw the ark hull on the flood 
0	which now abated for the clouds were fled 
0	driven by a keen north wind that blowing dry 
0	wrinkled the face of deluge as decayed 
0	and the clear sun on his wide watery glass
0	gazed hot and of the fresh wave largely drew 
0	as after thirst which made their flowing shrink
0	from standing lake to tripping ebb that stole
0	with soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt
0	his sluces as the heaven his windows shut 
0	the ark no more now floats but seems on ground 
0	fast on the top of some high mountain fixed 
0	and now the tops of hills as rocks appear 
0	with clamour thence the rapid currents drive 
0	towards the retreating sea their furious tide 
0	forthwith from out the ark a raven flies 
0	and after him the surer messenger 
0	a dove sent forth once and again to spy
0	green tree or ground whereon his foot may light 
0	the second time returning in his bill
0	an olive leaf he brings pacifick sign 
0	anon dry ground appears and from his ark
0	the ancient sire descends with all his train 
0	then with uplifted hands and eyes devout 
0	grateful to heaven over his head beholds
0	a dewy cloud and in the cloud a bow
0	conspicuous with three lifted colours gay 
0	betokening peace from god and covenant new 
0	whereat the heart of adam erst so sad 
0	greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth 
0	o thou who future things canst represent
0	as present heavenly instructer i revive
0	at this last sight assured that man shall live 
0	with all the creatures and their seed preserve 
0	far less i now lament for one whole world
0	of wicked sons destroyed than i rejoice
0	for one man found so perfect and so just 
0	that god vouchsafes to raise another world
0	from him and all his anger to forget 
0	but say what mean those coloured streaks in heaven
0	distended as the brow of god appeased 
0	or serve they as a flowery verge to bind
0	the fluid skirts of that same watery cloud 
0	lest it again dissolve and shower the earth 
0	to whom the arch angel dextrously thou aimest 
0	so willingly doth god remit his ire 
0	though late repenting him of man depraved 
0	grieved at his heart when looking down he saw
0	the whole earth filled with violence and all flesh
0	corrupting each their way yet those removed 
0	such grace shall one just man find in his sight 
0	that he relents not to blot out mankind 
0	and makes a covenant never to destroy
0	the earth again by flood nor let the sea
0	surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world 
0	with man therein or beast but when he brings
0	over the earth a cloud will therein set
0	his triple coloured bow whereon to look 
0	and call to mind his covenant day and night 
0	seed time and harvest heat and hoary frost 
0	shall hold their course till fire purge all things new 
0	both heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell 
0	as one who in his journey bates at noon 
0	though bent on speed so here the arch angel paused
0	betwixt the world destroyed and world restored 
0	if adam aught perhaps might interpose 
0	then with transition sweet new speech resumes 
0	thus thou hast seen one world begin and end 
0	and man as from a second stock proceed 
0	much thou hast yet to see but i perceive
0	thy mortal sight to fail objects divine
0	must needs impair and weary human sense 
0	henceforth what is to come i will relate 
0	thou therefore give due audience and attend 
0	this second source of men while yet but few 
0	and while the dread of judgement past remains
0	fresh in their minds fearing the deity 
0	with some regard to what is just and right
0	shall lead their lives and multiply apace 
0	labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop 
0	corn wine and oil and from the herd or flock 
0	oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid 
0	with large wine offerings poured and sacred feast 
0	shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell
0	long time in peace by families and tribes 
0	under paternal rule till one shall rise
0	of proud ambitious heart who not content
0	with fair equality fraternal state 
0	will arrogate dominion undeserved
0	over his brethren and quite dispossess
0	concord and law of nature from the earth 
0	hunting and men not beasts shall be his game 
0	with war and hostile snare such as refuse
0	subjection to his empire tyrannous 
0	a mighty hunter thence he shall be styled
0	before the lord as in despite of heaven 
0	or from heaven claiming second sovranty 
0	and from rebellion shall derive his name 
0	though of rebellion others he accuse 
0	he with a crew whom like ambition joins
0	with him or under him to tyrannize 
0	marching from eden towards the west shall find
0	the plain wherein a black bituminous gurge
0	boils out from under ground the mouth of hell 
0	of brick and of that stuff they cast to build
0	a city and tower whose top may reach to heaven 
0	and get themselves a name lest far dispersed
0	in foreign lands their memory be lost 
0	regardless whether good or evil fame 
0	but god who oft descends to visit men
0	unseen and through their habitations walks
0	to mark their doings them beholding soon 
0	comes down to see their city ere the tower
0	obstruct heaven towers and in derision sets
0	upon their tongues a various spirit to rase
0	quite out their native language and instead 
0	to sow a jangling noise of words unknown 
0	forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud 
0	among the builders each to other calls
0	not understood till hoarse and all in rage 
0	as mocked they storm great laughter was in heaven 
0	and looking down to see the hubbub strange 
0	and hear the din thus was the building left
0	ridiculous and the work confusion named 
0	whereto thus adam fatherly displeased 
0	o execrable son so to aspire
0	above his brethren to himself assuming
0	authority usurped from god not given 
0	he gave us only over beast fish fowl 
0	dominion absolute that right we hold
0	by his donation but man over men
0	he made not lord such title to himself
0	reserving human left from human free 
0	but this usurper his encroachment proud
0	stays not on man to god his tower intends
0	siege and defiance wretched man what food
0	will he convey up thither to sustain
0	himself and his rash army where thin air
0	above the clouds will pine his entrails gross 
0	and famish him of breath if not of bread 
0	to whom thus michael justly thou abhorrest
0	that son who on the quiet state of men
0	such trouble brought affecting to subdue
0	rational liberty yet know withal 
0	since thy original lapse true liberty
0	is lost which always with right reason dwells
0	twinned and from her hath no dividual being 
0	reason in man obscured or not obeyed 
0	immediately inordinate desires 
0	and upstart passions catch the government
0	from reason and to servitude reduce
0	man till then free therefore since he permits
0	within himself unworthy powers to reign
0	over free reason god in judgement just 
0	subjects him from without to violent lords 
0	who oft as undeservedly enthrall
0	his outward freedom tyranny must be 
0	though to the tyrant thereby no excuse 
0	yet sometimes nations will decline so low
0	from virtue which is reason that no wrong 
0	but justice and some fatal curse annexed 
0	deprives them of their outward liberty 
0	their inward lost witness the irreverent son
0	of him who built the ark who for the shame
0	done to his father heard this heavy curse 
0	servant of servants on his vicious race 
0	thus will this latter as the former world 
0	still tend from bad to worse till god at last 
0	wearied with their iniquities withdraw
0	his presence from among them and avert
0	his holy eyes resolving from thenceforth
0	to leave them to their own polluted ways 
0	and one peculiar nation to select
0	from all the rest of whom to be invoked 
0	a nation from one faithful man to spring 
0	him on this side euphrates yet residing 
0	bred up in idol worship o that men
0	 canst thou believe should be so stupid grown 
0	while yet the patriarch lived who scaped the flood 
0	as to forsake the living god and fall
0	to worship their own work in wood and stone
0	for gods yet him god the most high vouchsafes
0	to call by vision from his father s house 
0	his kindred and false gods into a land
0	which he will show him and from him will raise
0	a mighty nation and upon him shower
0	his benediction so that in his seed
0	all nations shall be blest he straight obeys 
0	not knowing to what land yet firm believes 
0	i see him but thou canst not with what faith
0	he leaves his gods his friends and native soil 
0	ur of chaldaea passing now the ford
0	to haran after him a cumbrous train
0	of herds and flocks and numerous servitude 
0	not wandering poor but trusting all his wealth
0	with god who called him in a land unknown 
0	canaan he now attains i see his tents
0	pitched about sechem and the neighbouring plain
0	of moreh there by promise he receives
0	gift to his progeny of all that land 
0	from hameth northward to the desart south 
0	 things by their names i call though yet unnamed 
0	from hermon east to the great western sea 
0	mount hermon yonder sea each place behold
0	in prospect as i point them on the shore
0	mount carmel here the double founted stream 
0	jordan true limit eastward but his sons
0	shall dwell to senir that long ridge of hills 
0	this ponder that all nations of the earth
0	shall in his seed be blessed by that seed
0	is meant thy great deliverer who shall bruise
0	the serpent s head whereof to thee anon
0	plainlier shall be revealed this patriarch blest 
0	whom faithful abraham due time shall call 
0	a son and of his son a grand child leaves 
0	like him in faith in wisdom and renown 
0	the grandchild with twelve sons increased departs
0	from canaan to a land hereafter called
0	see where it flows disgorging at seven mouths
0	into the sea to sojourn in that land
0	he comes invited by a younger son
0	in time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds
0	raise him to be the second in that realm
0	of pharaoh there he dies and leaves his race
0	growing into a nation and now grown
0	suspected to a sequent king who seeks
0	to stop their overgrowth as inmate guests
0	too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves
0	inhospitably and kills their infant males 
0	till by two brethren these two brethren call
0	moses and aaron sent from god to claim
0	his people from enthralment they return 
0	with glory and spoil back to their promised land 
0	but first the lawless tyrant who denies
0	to know their god or message to regard 
0	must be compelled by signs and judgements dire 
0	to blood unshed the rivers must be turned 
0	frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill
0	with loathed intrusion and fill all the land 
0	his cattle must of rot and murren die 
0	botches and blains must all his flesh emboss 
0	and all his people thunder mixed with hail 
0	and wheel on the earth devouring where it rolls 
0	what it devours not herb or fruit or grain 
0	a darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
0	must eat and on the ground leave nothing green 
0	darkness must overshadow all his bounds 
0	palpable darkness and blot out three days 
0	last with one midnight stroke all the first born
0	the river dragon tamed at length submits
0	to let his sojourners depart and oft
0	humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice
0	more hardened after thaw till in his rage
0	pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea
0	swallows him with his host but them lets pass 
0	as on dry land between two crystal walls 
0	awed by the rod of moses so to stand
0	divided till his rescued gain their shore 
0	such wondrous power god to his saint will lend 
0	though present in his angel who shall go
0	before them in a cloud and pillar of fire 
0	by day a cloud by night a pillar of fire 
0	to guide them in their journey and remove
0	behind them while the obdurate king pursues 
0	all night he will pursue but his approach
0	darkness defends between till morning watch 
0	then through the fiery pillar and the cloud 
0	god looking forth will trouble all his host 
0	and craze their chariot wheels when by command
0	moses once more his potent rod extends
0	over the sea the sea his rod obeys 
0	on their embattled ranks the waves return 
0	and overwhelm their war the race elect
0	safe toward canaan from the shore advance
0	through the wild desart not the readiest way 
0	lest entering on the canaanite alarmed 
0	war terrify them inexpert and fear
0	inglorious life with servitude for life
0	to noble and ignoble is more sweet
0	untrained in arms where rashness leads not on 
0	this also shall they gain by their delay
0	in the wide wilderness there they shall found
0	their government and their great senate choose
0	through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordained 
0	god from the mount of sinai whose gray top
0	shall tremble he descending will himself
0	in thunder lightning and loud trumpets sound 
0	ordain them laws part such as appertain
0	to civil justice part religious rites
0	of sacrifice informing them by types
0	and shadows of that destined seed to bruise
0	the serpent by what means he shall achieve
0	mankind s deliverance but the voice of god
0	to mortal ear is dreadful they beseech
0	that moses might report to them his will 
0	and terrour cease he grants what they besought 
0	instructed that to god is no access
0	without mediator whose high office now
0	moses in figure bears to introduce
0	one greater of whose day he shall foretel 
0	and all the prophets in their age the times
0	of great messiah shall sing thus laws and rites
0	established such delight hath god in men
0	obedient to his will that he vouchsafes
0	among them to set up his tabernacle 
0	the holy one with mortal men to dwell 
0	by his prescript a sanctuary is framed
0	of cedar overlaid with gold therein
0	an ark and in the ark his testimony 
0	the records of his covenant over these
0	a mercy seat of gold between the wings
0	of two bright cherubim before him burn
0	seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
0	the heavenly fires over the tent a cloud
0	shall rest by day a fiery gleam by night 
0	save when they journey and at length they come 
0	conducted by his angel to the land
0	promised to abraham and his seed the rest
0	were long to tell how many battles fought
0	how many kings destroyed and kingdoms won 
0	or how the sun shall in mid heaven stand still
0	a day entire and night s due course adjourn 
0	man s voice commanding sun in gibeon stand 
0	and thou moon in the vale of aialon 
0	till israel overcome so call the third
0	from abraham son of isaac and from him
0	his whole descent who thus shall canaan win 
0	here adam interposed o sent from heaven 
0	enlightener of my darkness gracious things
0	thou hast revealed those chiefly which concern
0	just abraham and his seed now first i find
0	mine eyes true opening and my heart much eased 
0	erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become
0	of me and all mankind but now i see
0	his day in whom all nations shall be blest 
0	favour unmerited by me who sought
0	forbidden knowledge by forbidden means 
0	this yet i apprehend not why to those
0	among whom god will deign to dwell on earth
0	so many and so various laws are given 
0	so many laws argue so many sins
0	among them how can god with such reside 
0	to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin
0	will reign among them as of thee begot 
0	and therefore was law given them to evince
0	their natural pravity by stirring up
0	sin against law to fight that when they see
0	law can discover sin but not remove 
0	save by those shadowy expiations weak 
0	the blood of bulls and goats they may conclude
0	some blood more precious must be paid for man 
0	just for unjust that in such righteousness
0	to them by faith imputed they may find
0	justification towards god and peace
0	of conscience which the law by ceremonies
0	cannot appease nor man the mortal part
0	perform and not performing cannot live 
0	so law appears imperfect and but given
0	with purpose to resign them in full time 
0	up to a better covenant disciplined
0	from shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit 
0	from imposition of strict laws to free
0	acceptance of large grace from servile fear
0	to filial works of law to works of faith 
0	and therefore shall not moses though of god
0	highly beloved being but the minister
0	of law his people into canaan lead 
0	but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call 
0	his name and office bearing who shall quell
0	the adversary serpent and bring back
0	through the world s wilderness long wandered man
0	safe to eternal paradise of rest 
0	mean while they in their earthly canaan placed 
0	long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins
0	national interrupt their publick peace 
0	provoking god to raise them enemies 
0	from whom as oft he saves them penitent
0	by judges first then under kings of whom
0	the second both for piety renowned
0	and puissant deeds a promise shall receive
0	irrevocable that his regal throne
0	for ever shall endure the like shall sing
0	all prophecy that of the royal stock
0	of david so i name this king shall rise
0	a son the woman s seed to thee foretold 
0	foretold to abraham as in whom shall trust
0	all nations and to kings foretold of kings
0	the last for of his reign shall be no end 
0	but first a long succession must ensue 
0	and his next son for wealth and wisdom famed 
0	the clouded ark of god till then in tents
0	wandering shall in a glorious temple enshrine 
0	such follow him as shall be registered
0	part good part bad of bad the longer scroll 
0	whose foul idolatries and other faults
0	heaped to the popular sum will so incense
0	god as to leave them and expose their land 
0	their city his temple and his holy ark 
0	with all his sacred things a scorn and prey
0	to that proud city whose high walls thou sawest
0	left in confusion babylon thence called 
0	there in captivity he lets them dwell
0	the space of seventy years then brings them back 
0	remembering mercy and his covenant sworn
0	to david stablished as the days of heaven 
0	returned from babylon by leave of kings
0	their lords whom god disposed the house of god
0	they first re edify and for a while
0	in mean estate live moderate till grown
0	in wealth and multitude factious they grow 
0	but first among the priests dissention springs 
0	men who attend the altar and should most
0	endeavour peace their strife pollution brings
0	upon the temple itself at last they seise
0	the scepter and regard not david s sons 
0	then lose it to a stranger that the true
0	anointed king messiah might be born
0	barred of his right yet at his birth a star 
0	unseen before in heaven proclaims him come 
0	and guides the eastern sages who inquire
0	his place to offer incense myrrh and gold 
0	his place of birth a solemn angel tells
0	to simple shepherds keeping watch by night 
0	they gladly thither haste and by a quire
0	of squadroned angels hear his carol sung 
0	a virgin is his mother but his sire
0	the power of the most high he shall ascend
0	the throne hereditary and bound his reign
0	with earth s wide bounds his glory with the heavens 
0	he ceased discerning adam with such joy
0	surcharged as had like grief been dewed in tears 
0	without the vent of words which these he breathed 
0	o prophet of glad tidings finisher
0	of utmost hope now clear i understand
0	what oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain 
0	why our great expectation should be called
0	the seed of woman virgin mother hail 
0	high in the love of heaven yet from my loins
0	thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son
0	of god most high so god with man unites 
0	needs must the serpent now his capital bruise
0	expect with mortal pain say where and when
0	their fight what stroke shall bruise the victor s heel 
0	to whom thus michael dream not of their fight 
0	as of a duel or the local wounds
0	of head or heel not therefore joins the son
0	manhood to godhead with more strength to foil
0	thy enemy nor so is overcome
0	satan whose fall from heaven a deadlier bruise 
0	disabled not to give thee thy death s wound 
0	which he who comes thy saviour shall recure 
0	not by destroying satan but his works
0	in thee and in thy seed nor can this be 
0	but by fulfilling that which thou didst want 
0	obedience to the law of god imposed
0	on penalty of death and suffering death 
0	the penalty to thy transgression due 
0	and due to theirs which out of thine will grow 
0	so only can high justice rest appaid 
0	the law of god exact he shall fulfil
0	both by obedience and by love though love
0	alone fulfil the law thy punishment
0	he shall endure by coming in the flesh
0	to a reproachful life and cursed death 
0	proclaiming life to all who shall believe
0	in his redemption and that his obedience 
0	imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
0	to save them not their own though legal works 
0	for this he shall live hated be blasphemed 
0	seised on by force judged and to death condemned
0	a shameful and accursed nailed to the cross
0	by his own nation slain for bringing life 
0	but to the cross he nails thy enemies 
0	the law that is against thee and the sins
0	of all mankind with him there crucified 
0	never to hurt them more who rightly trust
0	in this his satisfaction so he dies 
0	but soon revives death over him no power
0	shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
0	return the stars of morn shall see him rise
0	out of his grave fresh as the dawning light 
0	thy ransom paid which man from death redeems 
0	his death for man as many as offered life
0	neglect not and the benefit embrace
0	by faith not void of works this god like act
0	annuls thy doom the death thou shouldest have died 
0	in sin for ever lost from life this act
0	shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength 
0	defeating sin and death his two main arms 
0	and fix far deeper in his head their stings
0	than temporal death shall bruise the victor s heel 
0	or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep 
0	a gentle wafting to immortal life 
0	nor after resurrection shall he stay
0	longer on earth than certain times to appear
0	to his disciples men who in his life
0	still followed him to them shall leave in charge
0	to teach all nations what of him they learned
0	and his salvation them who shall believe
0	baptizing in the profluent stream the sign
0	of washing them from guilt of sin to life
0	pure and in mind prepared if so befall 
0	for death like that which the redeemer died 
0	all nations they shall teach for from that day 
0	not only to the sons of abraham s loins
0	salvation shall be preached but to the sons
0	of abraham s faith wherever through the world 
0	so in his seed all nations shall be blest 
0	then to the heaven of heavens he shall ascend
0	with victory triumphing through the air
0	over his foes and thine there shall surprise
0	the serpent prince of air and drag in chains
0	through all his realm and there confounded leave 
0	then enter into glory and resume
0	his seat at god s right hand exalted high
0	above all names in heaven and thence shall come 
0	when this world s dissolution shall be ripe 
0	with glory and power to judge both quick and dead 
0	to judge the unfaithful dead but to reward
0	his faithful and receive them into bliss 
0	whether in heaven or earth for then the earth
0	shall all be paradise far happier place
0	than this of eden and far happier days 
0	so spake the arch angel michael then paused 
0	as at the world s great period and our sire 
0	replete with joy and wonder thus replied 
0	o goodness infinite goodness immense 
0	that all this good of evil shall produce 
0	and evil turn to good more wonderful
0	than that which by creation first brought forth
0	light out of darkness full of doubt i stand 
0	whether i should repent me now of sin
0	by me done and occasioned or rejoice
0	much more that much more good thereof shall spring 
0	to god more glory more good will to men
0	from god and over wrath grace shall abound 
0	but say if our deliverer up to heaven
0	must re ascend what will betide the few
0	his faithful left among the unfaithful herd 
0	the enemies of truth who then shall guide
0	his people who defend will they not deal
0	worse with his followers than with him they dealt 
0	be sure they will said the angel but from heaven
0	he to his own a comforter will send 
0	the promise of the father who shall dwell
0	his spirit within them and the law of faith 
0	working through love upon their hearts shall write 
0	to guide them in all truth and also arm
0	with spiritual armour able to resist
0	satan s assaults and quench his fiery darts 
0	what man can do against them not afraid 
0	though to the death against such cruelties
0	with inward consolations recompensed 
0	and oft supported so as shall amaze
0	their proudest persecutors for the spirit 
0	poured first on his apostles whom he sends
0	to evangelize the nations then on all
0	baptized shall them with wonderous gifts endue
0	to speak all tongues and do all miracles 
0	as did their lord before them thus they win
0	great numbers of each nation to receive
0	with joy the tidings brought from heaven at length
0	their ministry performed and race well run 
0	their doctrine and their story written left 
0	they die but in their room as they forewarn 
0	wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves 
0	who all the sacred mysteries of heaven
0	to their own vile advantages shall turn
0	of lucre and ambition and the truth
0	with superstitions and traditions taint 
0	left only in those written records pure 
0	though not but by the spirit understood 
0	then shall they seek to avail themselves of names 
0	places and titles and with these to join
0	secular power though feigning still to act
0	by spiritual to themselves appropriating
0	the spirit of god promised alike and given
0	to all believers and from that pretence 
0	spiritual laws by carnal power shall force
0	on every conscience laws which none shall find
0	left them inrolled or what the spirit within
0	shall on the heart engrave what will they then
0	but force the spirit of grace itself and bind
0	his consort liberty what but unbuild
0	his living temples built by faith to stand 
0	their own faith not another s for on earth 
0	who against faith and conscience can be heard
0	infallible yet many will presume 
0	whence heavy persecution shall arise
0	on all who in the worship persevere
0	of spirit and truth the rest far greater part 
0	will deem in outward rites and specious forms
0	religion satisfied truth shall retire
0	bestuck with slanderous darts and works of faith
0	rarely be found so shall the world go on 
0	to good malignant to bad men benign 
0	under her own weight groaning till the day
0	appear of respiration to the just 
0	and vengeance to the wicked at return
0	of him so lately promised to thy aid 
0	the woman s seed obscurely then foretold 
0	now ampler known thy saviour and thy lord 
0	last in the clouds from heaven to be revealed
0	in glory of the father to dissolve
0	satan with his perverted world then raise
0	from the conflagrant mass purged and refined 
0	new heavens new earth ages of endless date 
0	founded in righteousness and peace and love 
0	to bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss 
0	he ended and thus adam last replied 
0	how soon hath thy prediction seer blest 
0	measured this transient world the race of time 
0	till time stand fixed beyond is all abyss 
0	eternity whose end no eye can reach 
0	greatly instructed i shall hence depart 
0	greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
0	of knowledge what this vessel can contain 
0	beyond which was my folly to aspire 
0	henceforth i learn that to obey is best 
0	and love with fear the only god to walk
0	as in his presence ever to observe
0	his providence and on him sole depend 
0	merciful over all his works with good
0	still overcoming evil and by small
0	accomplishing great things by things deemed weak
0	subverting worldly strong and worldly wise
0	by simply meek that suffering for truth s sake
0	is fortitude to highest victory 
0	and to the faithful death the gate of life 
0	taught this by his example whom i now
0	acknowledge my redeemer ever blest 
0	to whom thus also the angel last replied 
0	this having learned thou hast attained the sum
0	of wisdom hope no higher though all the stars
0	thou knewest by name and all the ethereal powers 
0	all secrets of the deep all nature s works 
0	or works of god in heaven air earth or sea 
0	and all the riches of this world enjoyedst 
0	and all the rule one empire only add
0	deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith 
0	add virtue patience temperance add love 
0	by name to come called charity the soul
0	of all the rest then wilt thou not be loth
0	to leave this paradise but shalt possess
0	a paradise within thee happier far 
0	let us descend now therefore from this top
0	of speculation for the hour precise
0	exacts our parting hence and see the guards 
0	by me encamped on yonder hill expect
0	their motion at whose front a flaming sword 
0	in signal of remove waves fiercely round 
0	we may no longer stay go waken eve 
0	her also i with gentle dreams have calmed
0	portending good and all her spirits composed
0	to meek submission thou at season fit 
0	let her with thee partake what thou hast heard 
0	chiefly what may concern her faith to know 
0	the great deliverance by her seed to come
0	 for by the woman s seed on all mankind 
0	that ye may live which will be many days 
0	both in one faith unanimous though sad 
0	with cause for evils past yet much more cheered
0	with meditation on the happy end 
0	he ended and they both descend the hill 
0	descended adam to the bower where eve
0	lay sleeping ran before but found her waked 
0	and thus with words not sad she him received 
0	whence thou returnest and whither wentest i know 
0	for god is also in sleep and dreams advise 
0	which he hath sent propitious some great good
0	presaging since with sorrow and heart s distress
0	wearied i fell asleep but now lead on 
0	in me is no delay with thee to go 
0	is to stay here without thee here to stay 
0	is to go hence unwilling thou to me
0	art all things under heaven all places thou 
0	who for my wilful crime art banished hence 
0	this further consolation yet secure
0	i carry hence though all by me is lost 
0	such favour i unworthy am vouchsafed 
0	by me the promised seed shall all restore 
0	so spake our mother eve and adam heard
0	well pleased but answered not for now too nigh
0	the arch angel stood and from the other hill
0	to their fixed station all in bright array
0	the cherubim descended on the ground
0	gliding meteorous as evening mist
0	risen from a river o er the marish glides 
0	and gathers ground fast at the labourer s heel
0	homeward returning high in front advanced 
0	the brandished sword of god before them blazed 
0	fierce as a comet which with torrid heat 
0	and vapour as the libyan air adust 
0	began to parch that temperate clime whereat
0	in either hand the hastening angel caught
0	our lingering parents and to the eastern gate
0	led them direct and down the cliff as fast
0	to the subjected plain then disappeared 
0	they looking back all the eastern side beheld
0	of paradise so late their happy seat 
0	waved over by that flaming brand the gate
0	with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms 
0	some natural tears they dropt but wiped them soon 
0	the world was all before them where to choose
0	their place of rest and providence their guide 
0	they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow 
0	through eden took their solitary way 
0	 of cerberus and blackest midnight born
0	in stygian cave forlorn
0	unholy 
0	find out some uncouth cell 
0	 where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings 
0	and the night raven sings 
0	as ragged as thy locks 
0	but come thou goddess fair and free 
0	in heaven yclept euphrosyne 
0	and by men heart easing mirth 
0	whom lovely venus at a birth 
0	with two sister graces more 
0	to ivy crowned bacchus bore 
0	hence loathed melancholy 
0	or whether as some sager sing 
0	the frolic wind that breathes the spring 
0	zephyr with aurora playing 
0	as he met her once a maying 
0	there on beds of violets blue 
0	and fresh blown roses washed in dew 
0	filled her with thee a daughter fair 
0	so buxom blithe and debonair 
0	haste thee nymph and bring with thee
0	jest and youthful jollity 
0	quips and cranks and wanton wiles 
0	nods and becks and wreathed smiles
0	such as hang on hebe s cheek 
0	and love to live in dimple sleek 
0	sport that wrinkled care derides 
0	and laughter holding both his sides 
0	come and trip it as you go 
0	on the light fantastic toe 
0	and in thy right hand lead with thee
0	the mountain nymph sweet liberty 
0	and if i give thee honour due 
0	mirth admit me of thy crew 
0	to live with her and live with thee 
0	in unreproved pleasures free 
0	to hear the lark begin his flight 
0	and singing startle the dull night 
0	from his watch tower in the skies 
0	till the dappled dawn doth rise 
0	then to come in spite of sorrow 
0	and at my window bid good morrow 
0	through the sweet briar or the vine 
0	or the twisted eglantine 
0	while the cock with lively din 
0	scatters the rear of darkness thin 
0	and to the stack or the barn door 
0	stoutly struts his dames before 
0	oft listening how the hounds and horn
0	cheerly rouse the slumbering morn 
0	from the side of some hoar hill 
0	through the high wood echoing shrill 
0	sometime walking not unseen 
0	by hedgerow elms on hillocks green 
0	right against the eastern gate
0	where the great sun begins his state 
0	robed in flames and amber light 
0	the clouds in thousand liveries dight 
0	while the ploughman near at hand 
0	whistles o er the furrowed land 
0	and the milkmaid singeth blithe 
0	and the mower whets his scythe 
0	and every shepherd tells his tale
0	under the hawthorn in the dale 
0	straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures 
0	whilst the landskip round it measures 
0	russet lawns and fallows grey 
0	where the nibbling flocks do stray 
0	mountains on whose barren breast
0	the labouring clouds do often rest 
0	meadows trim with daisies pied 
0	shallow brooks and rivers wide 
0	towers and battlements it sees
0	bosomed high in tufted trees 
0	where perhaps some beauty lies 
0	the cynosure of neighbouring eyes 
0	hard by a cottage chimney smokes
0	from betwixt two aged oaks 
0	are at their savoury dinner set
0	of herbs and other country messes 
0	which the neat handed phyllis dresses 
0	and then in haste her bower she leaves 
0	with thestylis to bind the sheaves 
0	or if the earlier season lead 
0	to the tanned haycock in the mead 
0	sometimes with secure delight 
0	the upland hamlets will invite 
0	when the merry bells ring round 
0	and the jocund rebecks sound
0	to many a youth and many a maid
0	dancing in the chequered shade 
0	and young and old come forth to play
0	on a sunshine holiday 
0	till the livelong daylight fail 
0	then to the spicy nut brown ale 
0	with stories told of many a feat 
0	how faery mab the junkets eat 
0	she was pinched and pulled she said 
0	and he by friar s lantern led 
0	tells how the drudging goblin sweat
0	to earn his cream bowl duly set 
0	when in one night ere glimpse of morn 
0	his shadowy flail hath threshed the corn
0	that ten day labourers could not end 
0	then lies him down the lubber fiend 
0	and stretched out all the chimney s length 
0	basks at the fire his hairy strength 
0	and crop full out of doors he flings 
0	ere the first cock his matin rings 
0	thus done the tales to bed they creep 
0	by whispering winds soon lulled asleep 
0	towered cities please us then 
0	and the busy hum of men 
0	where throngs of knights and barons bold 
0	in weeds of peace high triumphs hold
0	with store of ladies whose bright eyes
0	rain influence and judge the prize
0	of wit or arms while both contend
0	to win her grace whom all commend 
0	there let hymen oft appear
0	in saffron robe with taper clear 
0	and pomp and feast and revelry 
0	with mask and antique pageantry 
0	such sights as youthful poets dream
0	on summer eves by haunted stream 
0	then to the well trod stage anon 
0	if jonson s learned sock be on 
0	or sweetest shakespeare fancy s child 
0	warble his native wood notes wild 
0	and ever against eating cares 
0	lap me in soft lydian airs 
0	married to immortal verse 
0	such as the meeting soul may pierce 
0	in notes with many a winding bout
0	of linked sweetness long drawn out
0	with wanton heed and giddy cunning 
0	the melting voice through mazes running 
0	untwisting all the chains that tie
0	the hidden soul of harmony 
0	that orpheus self may heave his head
0	from golden slumber on a bed
0	of heaped elysian flowers and hear
0	such strains as would have won the ear
0	of pluto to have quite set free
0	his half regained eurydice 
0	these delights if thou canst give 
0	mirth with thee i mean to live 
0	hence vain deluding joys 
0	how little you bested
0	 or fill the fixed mind with all your toys 
0	dwell in some idle brain 
0	 and fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess 
0	as thick and numberless
0	or likest hovering dreams 
0	but hail thou goddess sage and holy 
0	hail divinest melancholy 
0	whose saintly visage is too bright
0	to hit the sense of human sight 
0	and therefore to our weaker view
0	o erlaid with black staid wisdom s hue 
0	black but such as in esteem
0	prince memnon s sister might beseem 
0	or that starred ethiop queen that strove
0	to set her beauty s praise above
0	the sea nymphs and their powers offended 
0	yet thou art higher far descended 
0	thee bright haired vesta long of yore
0	to solitary saturn bore 
0	his daughter she in saturn s reign
0	such mixture was not held a stain 
0	oft in glimmering bowers and glades
0	he met her and in secret shades
0	of woody ida s inmost grove 
0	whilst yet there was no fear of jove 
0	come pensive nun devout and pure 
0	sober steadfast and demure 
0	all in a robe of darkest grain 
0	flowing with majestic train 
0	and sable stole of cypress lawn
0	over thy decent shoulders drawn 
0	come but keep thy wonted state 
0	with even step and musing gait 
0	and looks commercing with the skies 
0	thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes 
0	there held in holy passion still 
0	forget thyself to marble till
0	with a sad leaden downward cast
0	thou fix them on the earth as fast 
0	and join with thee calm peace and quiet 
0	spare fast that oft with gods doth diet 
0	and hears the muses in a ring
0	aye round about jove s altar sing 
0	and add to these retired leisure 
0	that in trim gardens takes his pleasure 
0	but first and chiefest with thee bring
0	him that yon soars on golden wing 
0	guiding the fiery wheeled throne 
0	and the mute silence hist along 
0	 less philomel will deign a song 
0	in her sweetest saddest plight 
0	smoothing the rugged brow of night 
0	while cynthia checks her dragon yoke
0	gently o er the accustomed oak 
0	sweet bird that shunn st the noise of folly 
0	most musical most melancholy 
0	thee chauntress oft the woods among
0	i woo to hear thy even song 
0	and missing thee i walk unseen
0	on the dry smooth shaven green 
0	to behold the wandering moon 
0	riding near her highest noon 
0	like one that had been led astray
0	through the heaven s wide pathless way 
0	and oft as if her head she bowed 
0	stooping through a fleecy cloud 
0	oft on a plat of rising ground 
0	i hear the far off curfew sound 
0	over some wide watered shore 
0	swinging slow with sullen roar 
0	or if the air will not permit 
0	some still removed place will fit 
0	where glowing embers through the room
0	teach light to counterfeit a gloom 
0	far from all resort of mirth 
0	save the cricket on the hearth 
0	or the bellman s drowsy charm
0	to bless the doors from nightly harm 
0	or let my lamp at midnight hour 
0	be seen in some high lonely tower 
0	with thrice great hermes or unsphere
0	the spirit of plato to unfold
0	what worlds or what vast regions hold
0	the immortal mind that hath forsook
0	her mansion in this fleshly nook 
0	and of those demons that are found
0	in fire air flood or underground 
0	whose power hath a true consent
0	with planet or with element 
0	sometime let gorgeous tragedy
0	in sceptred pall come sweeping by 
0	presenting thebes or pelops line 
0	or the tale of troy divine 
0	or what though rare of later age
0	ennobled hath the buskined stage 
0	but o sad virgin that thy power
0	might raise musaeus from his bower 
0	or bid the soul of orpheus sing
0	such notes as warbled to the string 
0	drew iron tears down pluto s cheek 
0	and made hell grant what love did seek 
0	or call up him that left half told
0	the story of cambuscan bold 
0	and who had canace to wife 
0	that owned the virtuous ring and glass 
0	and of the wondrous horse of brass
0	on which the tartar king did ride 
0	and if aught else great bards beside
0	in sage and solemn tunes have sung 
0	of turneys and of trophies hung 
0	of forests and enchantments drear 
0	where more is meant than meets the ear 
0	thus night oft see me in thy pale career 
0	till civil suited morn appear 
0	not tricked and frounced as she was wont
0	with the attic boy to hunt 
0	but kerchieft in a comely cloud
0	while rocking winds are piping loud 
0	or ushered with a shower still 
0	when the gust hath blown his fill 
0	ending on the rustling leaves 
0	with minute drops from off the eaves 
0	and when the sun begins to fling
0	his flaring beams me goddess bring
0	to arched walks of twilight groves 
0	and shadows brown that sylvan loves 
0	of pine or monumental oak 
0	where the rude axe with heaved stroke
0	was never heard the nymphs to daunt 
0	or fright them from their hallowed haunt 
0	there in close covert by some brook 
0	where no profaner eye may look 
0	hide me from day s garish eye 
0	while the bee with honeyed thigh 
0	that at her flowery work doth sing 
0	and the waters murmuring 
0	with such consort as they keep 
0	entice the dewy feathered sleep 
0	and let some strange mysterious dream
0	wave at his wings in airy stream
0	of lively portraiture displayed 
0	softly on my eyelids laid 
0	and as i wake sweet music breathe
0	above about or underneath 
0	sent by some spirit to mortals good 
0	or the unseen genius of the wood 
0	but let my due feet never fail
0	to walk the studious cloister s pale 
0	and love the high embowed roof 
0	with antique pillars massy proof 
0	and storied windows richly dight 
0	casting a dim religious light 
0	there let the pealing organ blow 
0	to the full voiced quire below 
0	in service high and anthems clear 
0	as may with sweetness through mine ear 
0	dissolve me into ecstasies 
0	and bring all heaven before mine eyes 
0	and may at last my weary age
0	find out the peaceful hermitage 
0	the hairy gown and mossy cell 
0	where i may sit and rightly spell
0	of every star that heaven doth shew 
0	and every herb that sips the dew 
0	till old experience do attain
0	to something like prophetic strain 
0	these pleasures melancholy give 
0	and i with thee will choose to live 
0	the attendant spirit afterwards in the habit of thyrsis 
0	comus with his crew 
0	sabrina the nymph 
0	the chief persons which presented were 
0	the first scene discovers a wild wood 
0	the attendant spirit descends or enters 
0	before the starry threshold of jove s court
0	my mansion is where those immortal shapes
0	of bright aerial spirits live insphered
0	in regions mild of calm and serene air 
0	above the smoke and stir of this dim spot
0	which men call earth and with low thoughted care 
0	confined and pestered in this pinfold here 
0	strive to keep up a frail and feverish being 
0	unmindful of the crown that virtue gives 
0	after this mortal change to her true servants
0	amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats 
0	yet some there be that by due steps aspire
0	to lay their just hands on that golden key
0	that opes the palace of eternity 
0	to such my errand is and but for such 
0	i would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds
0	with the rank vapours of this sin worn mould 
0	but to my task neptune besides the sway
0	of every salt flood and each ebbing stream 
0	took in by lot twixt high and nether jove 
0	imperial rule of all the sea girt isles
0	that like to rich and various gems inlay
0	the unadorned bosom of the deep 
0	which he to grace his tributary gods 
0	by course commits to several government 
0	and gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns
0	and wield their little tridents but this isle 
0	the greatest and the best of all the main 
0	he quarters to his blue haired deities 
0	and all this tract that fronts the falling sun
0	a noble peer of mickle trust and power
0	has in his charge with tempered awe to guide
0	an old and haughty nation proud in arms 
0	where his fair offspring nursed in princely lore 
0	are coming to attend their father s state 
0	and new intrusted sceptre but their way
0	lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood 
0	the nodding horror of whose shady brows
0	threats the forlorn and wandering passenger 
0	and here their tender age might suffer peril 
0	but that by quick command from sovran jove 
0	i was despatched for their defence and guard 
0	and listen why for i will tell you now
0	what never yet was heard in tale or song 
0	from old or modern bard in hall or bower 
0	bacchus that first from out the purple grape
0	crushed the sweet poison of misused wine 
0	after the tuscan mariners transformed 
0	coasting the tyrrhene shore as the winds listed 
0	on circe s island fell who knows not circe 
0	the daughter of the sun whose charmed cup
0	whoever tasted lost his upright shape 
0	and downward fell into a grovelling swine 
0	this nymph that gazed upon his clustering locks 
0	with ivy berries wreathed and his blithe youth 
0	had by him ere he parted thence a son
0	much like his father but his mother more 
0	whom therefore she brought up and comus named 
0	who ripe and frolic of his full grown age 
0	roving the celtic and iberian fields 
0	at last betakes him to this ominous wood 
0	and in thick shelter of black shades imbowered 
0	excels his mother at her mighty art 
0	offering to every weary traveller
0	his orient liquor in a crystal glass 
0	to quench the drouth of phoebus which as they taste
0	 for most do taste through fond intemperate thirst 
0	soon as the potion works their human count nance 
0	the express resemblance of the gods is changed
0	into some brutish form of wolf or bear 
0	or ounce or tiger hog or bearded goat 
0	all other parts remaining as they were 
0	and they so perfect is their misery 
0	not once perceive their foul disfigurement 
0	but boast themselves more comely than before 
0	and all their friends and native home forget 
0	to roll with pleasure in a sensual sty 
0	therefore when any favoured of high jove
0	chances to pass through this adventurous glade 
0	swift as the sparkle of a glancing star
0	i shoot from heaven to give him safe convoy 
0	as now i do but first i must put off
0	these my sky robes spun out of iris woof 
0	and take the weeds and likeness of a swain
0	that to the service of this house belongs 
0	who with his soft pipe and smooth dittied song 
0	well knows to still the wild winds when they roar 
0	and hush the waving woods nor of less faith
0	and in this office of his mountain watch
0	likeliest and nearest to the present aid
0	of this occasion but i hear the tread
0	of hateful steps i must be viewless now 
0	comus enters with a charming rod in one hand his glass in the
0	other with him a rout of monsters headed like sundry sorts of
0	beasts but otherwise like men and women their apparel
0	glistering 
0	they come in making a riotous and unruly noise with torches in
0	their hands 
0	comus the star that bids the shepherd fold
0	now the top of heaven doth hold 
0	and the gilded car of day
0	his glowing axle doth allay
0	in the steep atlantic stream 
0	and the slope sun his upward beam
0	shoots against the dusky pole 
0	pacing toward the other goal
0	of his chamber in the east 
0	meanwhile welcome joy and feast 
0	midnight shout and revelry 
0	tipsy dance and jollity 
0	braid your locks with rosy twine 
0	dropping odours dropping wine 
0	rigour now is gone to bed 
0	and advice with scrupulous head 
0	strict age and sour severity 
0	with their grave saws in slumber lie 
0	we that are of purer fire 
0	imitate the starry quire 
0	who in their nightly watchful spheres 
0	lead in swift round the months and years 
0	the sounds and seas with all their finny drove 
0	now to the moon in wavering morrice move 
0	and on the tawny sands and shelves
0	trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves 
0	by dimpled brook and fountain brim 
0	the wood nymphs decked with daisies trim 
0	their merry wakes and pastimes keep 
0	what hath night to do with sleep 
0	night hath better sweets to prove 
0	venus now wakes and wakens love 
0	come let us our rights begin 
0	 t is only daylight that makes sin 
0	which these dun shades will ne er report 
0	hail goddess of nocturnal sport 
0	dark veiled cotytto to whom the secret flame
0	of midnight torches burns mysterious dame 
0	that ne er art called but when the dragon womb
0	of stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom 
0	and makes one blot of all the air 
0	stay thy cloudy ebon chair 
0	wherein thou ridest with hecat and befriend
0	us thy vowed priests till utmost end
0	of all thy dues be done and none left out 
0	ere the blabbing eastern scout 
0	the nice morn on the indian steep 
0	from her cabined loop hole peep 
0	and to the tell tale sun descry
0	our concealed solemnity 
0	come knit hands and beat the ground
0	in a light fantastic round 
0	break off break off i feel the different pace
0	of some chaste footing near about this ground 
0	run to your shrouds within these brakes and trees 
0	our number may affright some virgin sure
0	 for so i can distinguish by mine art 
0	benighted in these woods now to my charms 
0	and to my wily trains i shall ere long
0	be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed
0	about my mother circe thus i hurl
0	my dazzling spells into the spongy air 
0	of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion 
0	and give it false presentments lest the place
0	and my quaint habits breed astonishment 
0	and put the damsel to suspicious flight 
0	which must not be for that s against my course 
0	i under fair pretence of friendly ends 
0	and well placed words of glozing courtesy 
0	baited with reasons not unplausible 
0	wind me into the easy hearted man 
0	and hug him into snares when once her eye
0	hath met the virtue of this magic dust 
0	i shall appear some harmless villager
0	whom thrift keeps up about his country gear 
0	but here she comes i fairly step aside 
0	and hearken if i may her business hear 
0	the lady enters 
0	lady this way the noise was if mine ear be true 
0	my best guide now methought it was the sound
0	of riot and ill managed merriment 
0	such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe
0	stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds 
0	when for their teeming flocks and granges full 
0	in wanton dance they praise the bounteous pan 
0	and thank the gods amiss i should be loth
0	to meet the rudeness and swilled insolence
0	of such late wassailers yet oh where else
0	shall i inform my unacquainted feet
0	in the blind mazes of this tangled wood 
0	my brothers when they saw me wearied out
0	with this long way resolving here to lodge
0	under the spreading favour of these pines 
0	stepped as they said to the next thicket side
0	to bring me berries or such cooling fruit
0	as the kind hospitable woods provide 
0	they left me then when the grey hooded even 
0	like a sad votarist in palmer s weed 
0	rose from the hindmost wheels of phoebus wain 
0	but where they are and why they came not back 
0	is now the labour of my thoughts tis likeliest
0	they had engaged their wandering steps too far 
0	and envious darkness ere they could return 
0	had stole them from me else o thievish night 
0	why shouldst thou but for some felonious end 
0	in thy dark lantern thus close up the stars
0	that nature hung in heaven and filled their lamps
0	with everlasting oil to give due light
0	to the misled and lonely traveller 
0	this is the place as well as i may guess 
0	whence even now the tumult of loud mirth
0	was rife and perfect in my listening ear 
0	yet nought but single darkness do i find 
0	what might this be a thousand fantasies
0	begin to throng into my memory 
0	of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire 
0	and airy tongues that syllable men s names
0	on sands and shores and desert wildernesses 
0	these thoughts may startle well but not astound
0	the virtuous mind that ever walks attended
0	by a strong siding champion conscience 
0	o welcome pure eyed faith white handed hope 
0	thou hovering angel girt with golden wings 
0	and thou unblemished form of chastity 
0	i see ye visibly and now believe
0	that he the supreme good to whom all things ill
0	are but as slavish officers of vengeance 
0	would send a glistering guardian if need were 
0	to keep my life and honour unassailed 
0	was i deceived or did a sable cloud
0	turn forth her silver lining on the night 
0	i did not err there does a sable cloud
0	turn forth her silver lining on the night 
0	and casts a gleam over this tufted grove 
0	i cannot hallo to my brothers but
0	such noise as i can make to be heard farthest
0	i ll venture for my new enlivened spirits
0	prompt me and they perhaps are not far off 
0	sweet echo sweetest nymph that liv st unseen
0	within thy airy shell
0	by slow meander s margent green 
0	and in the violet embroidered vale
0	where the love lorn nightingale
0	nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well 
0	canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair
0	that likest thy narcissus are 
0	o if thou have
0	hid them in some flowery cave 
0	tell me but where 
0	so may st thou be translated to the skies 
0	and give resounding grace to all heaven s harmonies 
0	comus can any mortal mixture of earth s mould
0	breathe such divine enchanting ravishment 
0	sure something holy lodges in that breast 
0	and with these raptures moves the vocal air
0	to testify his hidden residence 
0	how sweetly did they float upon the wings
0	of silence through the empty vaulted night 
0	at every fall smoothing the raven down
0	of darkness till it smiled i have oft heard
0	my mother circe with the sirens three 
0	amidst the flowery kirtled naiades 
0	culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs 
0	who as they sung would take the prisoned soul 
0	and lap it in elysium scylla wept 
0	and chid her barking waves into attention 
0	and fell charybdis murmured soft applause 
0	yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense 
0	and in sweet madness robbed it of itself 
0	but such a sacred and home felt delight 
0	such sober certainty of waking bliss 
0	i never heard till now i ll speak to her 
0	and she shall be my queen hail foreign wonder 
0	whom certain these rough shades did never breed 
0	unless the goddess that in rural shrine
0	dwell st here with pan or sylvan by blest song
0	forbidding every bleak unkindly fog
0	to touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood 
0	lady nay gentle shepherd ill is lost that praise
0	that is addressed to unattending ears 
0	not any boast of skill but extreme shift
0	how to regain my severed company 
0	compelled me to awake the courteous echo
0	to give me answer from her mossy couch 
0	comus what chance good lady hath bereft you thus 
0	lady dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth 
0	comus could that divide you from near ushering guides 
0	lady they left me weary on a grassy turf 
0	comus by falsehood or discourtesy or why 
0	lady to seek i the valley some cool friendly spring 
0	comus and left your fair side all unguarded lady 
0	lady they were but twain and purposed quick return 
0	comus perhaps forestalling night prevented them 
0	lady how easy my misfortune is to hit 
0	comus imports their loss beside the present need 
0	lady no less than if i should my brothers lose 
0	comus were they of manly prime or youthful bloom 
0	lady as smooth as hebe s their unrazored lips 
0	comus two such i saw what time the laboured ox
0	in his loose traces from the furrow came 
0	and the swinked hedger at his supper sat 
0	i saw them under a green mantling vine 
0	that crawls along the side of yon small hill 
0	plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots 
0	their port was more than human as they stood 
0	i took it for a faery vision
0	of some gay creatures of the element 
0	that in the colours of the rainbow live 
0	and play i the plighted clouds i was awe strook 
0	and as i passed i worshiped if those you seek 
0	it were a journey like the path to heaven
0	to help you find them 
0	lady gentle villager 
0	what readiest way would bring me to that place 
0	comus due west it rises from this shrubby point 
0	lady to find out that good shepherd i suppose 
0	in such a scant allowance of star light 
0	would overtask the best land pilot s art 
0	without the sure guess of well practised feet 
0	comus i know each lane and every alley green 
0	dingle or bushy dell of this wild wood 
0	and every bosky bourn from side to side 
0	my daily walks and ancient neighbourhood 
0	and if your stray attendance be yet lodged 
0	or shroud within these limits i shall know
0	ere morrow wake or the low roosted lark
0	from her thatched pallet rouse if otherwise 
0	i can conduct you lady to a low
0	but loyal cottage where you may be safe
0	till further quest 
0	lady shepherd i take thy word 
0	and trust thy honest offered courtesy 
0	which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds 
0	with smoky rafters than in tapestry halls
0	and courts of princes where it first was named 
0	and yet is most pretended in a place
0	less warranted than this or less secure 
0	i cannot be that i should fear to change it 
0	eye me blest providence and square my trial
0	to my proportioned strength shepherd lead on 
0	eld bro unmuffle ye faint stars and thou fair moon 
0	that wont st to love the traveller s benison 
0	stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud 
0	and disinherit chaos that reigns here
0	in double night of darkness and of shades 
0	or if your influence be quite dammed up
0	with black usurping mists some gentle taper 
0	though a rush candle from the wicker hole
0	of some clay habitation visit us
0	with thy long levelled rule of streaming light 
0	and thou shalt be our star of arcady 
0	sec bro or if our eyes
0	be barred that happiness might we but hear
0	the folded flocks penned in their wattled cotes 
0	or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops 
0	or whistle from the lodge or village cock
0	count the night watches to his feathery dames 
0	 t would be some solace yet some little cheering 
0	in this close dungeon of innumerous boughs 
0	but oh that hapless virgin our lost sister 
0	where may she wander now whither betake her
0	from the chill dew amongst rude burs and thistles
0	perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now 
0	or gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm
0	leans her unpillowed head fraught with sad fears 
0	what if in wild amazement and affright 
0	or while we speak within the direful grasp
0	of savage hunger or of savage heat 
0	eld bro peace brother be not over exquisite
0	to cast the fashion of uncertain evils 
0	for grant they be so while they rest unknown 
0	what need a man forestall his date of grief 
0	and run to meet what he would most avoid 
0	or if they be but false alarms of fear 
0	how bitter is such self delusion 
0	i do not think my sister so to seek 
0	or so unprincipled in virtue s book 
0	and the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever 
0	as that the single want of light and noise
0	 not being in danger as i trust she is not 
0	could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts 
0	and put them into misbecoming plight 
0	virtue could see to do what virtue would
0	by her own radiant light though sun and moon
0	were in the flat sea sunk and wisdom s self
0	oft seeks to sweet retired solitude 
0	where with her best nurse contemplation 
0	she plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings 
0	that in the various bustle of resort 
0	were all to ruffled and sometimes impaired 
0	he that has light within his own clear breast
0	may sit i the centre and enjoy bright day 
0	but he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
0	benighted walks under the mid day sun 
0	himself is his own dungeon 
0	sec bro tis most true
0	that musing meditation most affects
0	the pensive secrecy of desert cell 
0	far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds 
0	and sits as safe as in a senate house
0	for who would rob a hermit of his weeds 
0	his few books or his beads or maple dish 
0	or do his grey hairs any violence 
0	but beauty like the fair hesperian tree
0	laden with blooming gold had need the guard
0	of dragon watch with unenchanted eye
0	to save her blossoms and defend her fruit 
0	from the rash hand of bold incontinence 
0	you may as well spread out the unsunned heaps
0	of miser s treasure by an outlaw s den 
0	and tell me it is safe as bid me hope
0	danger will wink on opportunity 
0	and let a single helpless maiden pass
0	uninjured in this wild surrounding waste 
0	of night or loneliness it recks me not 
0	i fear the dread events that dog them both 
0	lest some ill greeting touch attempt the person
0	of our unowned sister 
0	eld bro i do not brother 
0	infer as if i thought my sister s state
0	secure without all doubt or controversy 
0	yet where an equal poise of hope and fear
0	does arbitrate the event my nature is
0	that i incline to hope rather than fear 
0	and gladly banish squint suspicion 
0	my sister is not so defenceless left
0	as you imagine she has a hidden strength 
0	which you remember not 
0	sec bro what hidden strength 
0	unless the strength of heaven if you mean that 
0	eld bro i mean that too but yet a hidden strength 
0	which if heaven gave it may be termed her own 
0	 tis chastity my brother chastity 
0	she that has that is clad in complete steel 
0	and like a quivered nymph with arrows keen 
0	may trace huge forests and unharboured heaths 
0	infamous hills and sandy perilous wilds 
0	where through the sacred rays of chastity 
0	no savage fierce bandite or mountaineer 
0	will dare to soil her virgin purity 
0	yea there where very desolation dwells 
0	by grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades 
0	she may pass on with unblenched majesty 
0	be it not done in pride or in presumption 
0	some say no evil thing that walks by night 
0	in fog or fire by lake or moorish fen 
0	blue meagre hag or stubborn unlaid ghost 
0	that breaks his magic chains at curfew time 
0	no goblin or swart faery of the mine 
0	hath hurtful power o er true virginity 
0	do ye believe me yet or shall i call
0	antiquity from the old schools of greece
0	to testify the arms of chastity 
0	hence had the huntress dian her dread bow
0	fair silver shafted queen for ever chaste 
0	wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness
0	and spotted mountain pard but set at nought
0	the frivolous bolt of cupid gods and men
0	feared her stern frown and she was queen o the woods 
0	what was that snaky headed gorgon shield
0	that wise minerva wore unconquered virgin 
0	wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone 
0	but rigid looks of chaste austerity 
0	and noble grace that dashed brute violence
0	with sudden adoration and blank awe 
0	so dear to heaven is saintly chastity
0	that when a soul is found sincerely so 
0	a thousand liveried angels lackey her 
0	driving far off each thing of sin and guilt 
0	and in clear dream and solemn vision
0	tell her of things that no gross ear can hear 
0	till oft converse with heavenly habitants
0	begin to cast a beam on the outward shape 
0	the unpolluted temple of the mind 
0	and turns it by degrees to the soul s essence 
0	till all be made immortal but when lust 
0	by unchaste looks loose gestures and foul talk 
0	but most by lewd and lavish act of sin 
0	lets in defilement to the inward parts 
0	the soul grows clotted by contagion 
0	imbodies and imbrutes till she quite loose
0	the divine property of her first being 
0	such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp
0	oft seen in charnel vaults and sepulchres 
0	lingering and sitting by a new made grave 
0	as loth to leave the body that it loved 
0	and linked itself by carnal sensualty
0	to a degenerate and degraded state 
0	sec bro how charming is divine philosophy 
0	not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose 
0	but musical as is apollo s lute 
0	and a perpetual feast of nectared sweets 
0	where no crude surfeit reigns

0	shew 
0	spir i ll tell ye t is not vain or fabulous
0	 though so esteemed by shallow ignorance 
0	what the sage poets taught by the heavenly muse 
0	storied of old in high immortal verse
0	of dire chimeras and enchanted isles 
0	and rifted rocks whose entrance leads to hell 
0	for such there be but unbelief is blind 
0	within the navel of this hideous wood 
0	immured in cypress shades a sorcerer dwells 
0	of bacchus and of circe born great comus 
0	deep skilled in all his mother s witcheries 
0	and here to every thirsty wanderer
0	by sly enticement gives his baneful cup 
0	with many murmurs mixed whose pleasing poison
0	the visage quite transforms of him that drinks 
0	and the inglorious likeness of a beast
0	fixes instead unmoulding reason s mintage
0	charactered in the face this have i learnt
0	tending my flocks hard by i the hilly crofts
0	that brow this bottom glade whence night by night
0	he and his monstrous rout are heard to howl
0	like stabled wolves or tigers at their prey 
0	doing abhorred rites to hecate
0	in their obscured haunts of inmost bowers 
0	yet have they many baits and guileful spells
0	to inveigle and invite the unwary sense
0	of them that pass unweeting by the way 
0	this evening late by then the chewing flocks
0	had ta en their supper on the savoury herb
0	of knot grass dew besprent and were in fold 
0	i sat me down to watch upon a bank
0	with ivy canopied and interwove
0	with flaunting honeysuckle and began 
0	wrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy 
0	to meditate my rural minstrelsy 
0	till fancy had her fill but ere a close
0	the wonted roar was up amidst the woods 
0	and filled the air with barbarous dissonance 
0	at which i ceased and listened them awhile 
0	till an unusual stop of sudden silence
0	gave respite to the drowsy flighted steeds
0	that draw the litter of close curtained sleep 
0	at last a soft and solemn breathing sound
0	rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes 
0	and stole upon the air that even silence
0	was took ere she was ware and wished she might
0	deny her nature and be never more 
0	still to be so displaced i was all ear 
0	and took in strains that might create a soul
0	under the ribs of death but oh ere long
0	too well i did perceive it was the voice
0	of my most honoured lady your dear sister 
0	amazed i stood harrowed with grief and fear 
0	and o poor hapless nightingale thought i 
0	 how sweet thou sing st how near the deadly snare 
0	then down the lawns i ran with headlong haste 
0	through paths and turnings often trod by day 
0	till guided by mine ear i found the place
0	where that damned wizard hid in sly disguise
0	 for so by certain signs i knew had met
0	already ere my best speed could prevent 
0	the aidless innocent lady his wished prey 
0	who gently asked if he had seen such two 
0	supposing him some neighbour villager 
0	longer i durst not stay but soon i guessed
0	ye were the two she meant with that i sprung
0	into swift flight till i had found you here 
0	but further know i not 
0	sec bro o night and shades 
0	how are ye joined with hell in triple knot
0	against the unarmed weakness of one virgin 
0	alone and helpless is this the confidence
0	you gave me brother 
0	eld bro yes and keep it still 
0	lean on it safely not a period
0	shall be unsaid for me against the threats
0	of malice or of sorcery or that power
0	which erring men call chance this i hold firm 
0	virtue may be assailed but never hurt 
0	surprised by unjust force but not enthralled 
0	yea even that which mischief meant most harm
0	shall in the happy trial prove most glory 
0	but evil on itself shall back recoil 
0	and mix no more with goodness when at last 
0	gathered like scum and settled to itself 
0	it shall be in eternal restless change
0	self fed and self consumed if this fail 
0	the pillared firmament is rottenness 
0	and earth s base built on stubble but come let s on 
0	against the opposing will and arm of heaven
0	may never this just sword be lifted up 
0	but for that damned magician let him be girt
0	with all the grisly legions that troop
0	under the sooty flag of acheron 
0	harpies and hydras or all the monstrous forms
0	 twixt africa and ind i ll find him out 
0	and force him to return his purchase back 
0	or drag him by the curls to a foul death 
0	cursed as his life 
0	spir alas good venturous youth 
0	i love thy courage yet and bold emprise 
0	but here thy sword can do thee little stead 
0	far other arms and other weapons must
0	be those that quell the might of hellish charms 
0	he with his bare wand can unthread thy joints 
0	and crumble all thy sinews 
0	eld bro why prithee 
0	how durst thou then thyself approach so near
0	as to make this relation 
0	spir care and utmost
0	shifts
0	how to secure the lady from surprisal
0	brought to my mind a certain shepherd lad 
0	of small regard to see to yet well skilled
0	in every virtuous plant and healing herb
0	that spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray 
0	he loved me well and oft would beg me sing 
0	which when i did he on the tender grass
0	would sit and hearken even to ecstasy 
0	and in requital ope his leathern scrip 
0	and show me simples of a thousand names 
0	telling their strange and vigorous faculties 
0	amongst the rest a small unsightly root 
0	but of divine effect he culled me out 
0	the leaf was darkish and had prickles on it 
0	but in another country as he said 
0	bore a bright golden flower but not in this soil 
0	unknown and like esteemed and the dull swain
0	treads on it daily with his clouted shoon 
0	and yet more med cinal is it than that moly
0	that hermes once to wise ulysses gave 
0	he called it haemony and gave it me 
0	and bade me keep it as of sovran use
0	 gainst all enchantments mildew blast or damp 
0	or ghastly furies apparition 
0	i pursed it up but little reckoning made 
0	till now that this extremity compelled 
0	but now i find it true for by this means
0	i knew the foul enchanter though disguised 
0	entered the very lime twigs of his spells 
0	and yet came off if you have this about you
0	 as i will give you when we go you may
0	boldly assault the necromancer s hall 
0	where if he be with dauntless hardihood
0	and brandished blade rush on him break his glass 
0	and shed the luscious liquor on the ground 
0	but seize his wand though he and his curst crew
0	fierce sign of battle make and menace high 
0	or like the sons of vulcan vomit smoke 
0	yet will they soon retire if he but shrink 
0	eld bro thyrsis lead on apace i ll follow thee 
0	and some good angel bear a shield before us 
0	the scene changes to a stately palace set out with all manner of
0	whom he offers his glass which she puts by and goes about to
0	rise 
0	comus nay lady sit if i but wave this wand 
0	your nerves are all chained up in alabaster 
0	and you a statue or as daphne was 
0	root bound that fled apollo 
0	lady fool do not boast 
0	thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind
0	with all thy charms although this corporal rind
0	thou hast immanacled while heaven sees good 
0	comus why are you vexed lady why do you frown 
0	here dwell no frowns nor anger from these gates
0	sorrow flies far see here be all the pleasures
0	that fancy can beget on youthful thoughts 
0	when the fresh blood grows lively and returns
0	brisk as the april buds in primrose season 
0	and first behold this cordial julep here 
0	that flames and dances in his crystal bounds 
0	with spirits of balm and fragrant syrups mixed 
0	not that nepenthes which the wife of thone
0	is of such power to stir up joy as this 
0	to life so friendly or so cool to thirst 
0	why should you be so cruel to yourself 
0	and to those dainty limbs which nature lent
0	for gentle usage and soft delicacy 
0	but you invert the covenants of her trust 
0	and harshly deal like an ill borrower 
0	with that which you received on other terms 
0	scorning the unexempt condition
0	by which all mortal frailty must subsist 
0	refreshment after toil ease after pain 
0	that have been tired all day without repast 
0	and timely rest have wanted but fair virgin 
0	this will restore all soon 
0	lady t will not false
0	traitor 
0	 t will not restore the truth and honesty
0	that thou hast banished from thy tongue with lies 
0	was this the cottage and the safe abode
0	thou told st me of what grim aspects are these 
0	these oughly headed monsters mercy guard me 
0	hence with thy brewed enchantments foul deceiver 
0	hast thou betrayed my credulous innocence
0	with vizored falsehood and base forgery 
0	and would st thou seek again to trap me here
0	with liquorish baits fit to ensnare a brute 
0	were it a draught for juno when she banquets 
0	i would not taste thy treasonous offer none
0	but such as are good men can give good things 
0	and that which is not good is not delicious
0	to a well governed and wise appetite 
0	comus o foolishness of men that lend their ears
0	to those budge doctors of the stoic fur 
0	and fetch their precepts from the cynic tub 
0	praising the lean and sallow abstinence 
0	wherefore did nature pour her bounties forth
0	with such a full and unwithdrawing hand 
0	covering the earth with odours fruits and flocks 
0	thronging the seas with spawn innumerable 
0	but all to please and sate the curious taste 
0	and set to work millions of spinning worms 
0	that in their green shops weave the smooth haired silk 
0	to deck her sons and that no corner might
0	be vacant of her plenty in her own loins
0	she hutched the all worshipped ore and precious gems 
0	to store her children with if all the world
0	should in a pet of temperance feed on pulse 
0	drink the clear stream and nothing wear but frieze 
0	the all giver would be unthanked would be unpraised 
0	not half his riches known and yet despised 
0	and we should serve him as a grudging master 
0	who would be quite surcharged with her own weight

0	the earth cumbered and the winged air darked with plumes 
0	the herds would over multitude their lords 
0	the sea o erfraught would swell and the unsought diamonds
0	would so emblaze the forehead of the deep

0	consists in mutual and partaken bliss 
0	unsavoury in the enjoyment of itself 
0	if you let slip time like a neglected rose

0	spir what have you let the false enchanter scape 
0	o ye mistook ye should have snatched his wand 
0	and bound him fast without his rod reversed 
0	and backward mutters of dissevering power 
0	we cannot free the lady that sits here
0	in stony fetters fixed and motionless 
0	yet stay be not disturbed now i bethink me 
0	some other means i have which may be used 
0	which once of meliboeus old i learnt 
0	the soothest shepherd that e er piped on plains 
0	there is a gentle nymph not far from hence 
0	that with moist curb sways the smooth severn stream 
0	sabrina is her name a virgin pure 
0	whilom she was the daughter of locrine 
0	that had the sceptre from his father brute 
0	she guiltless damsel flying the mad pursuit
0	of her enraged stepdame guendolen 
0	commended her fair innocence to the flood
0	that stayed her flight with his cross flowing course 
0	the water nymphs that in the bottom played 
0	held up their pearled wrists and took her in 
0	bearing her straight to aged nereus hall 
0	who piteous of her woes reared her lank head 
0	and gave her to his daughters to imbathe
0	in nectared lavers strewed with asphodil 
0	and through the porch and inlet of each sense
0	dropt in ambrosial oils till she revived 
0	and underwent a quick immortal change 
0	made goddess of the river still she retains
0	her maiden gentleness and oft at eve
0	visits the herds along the twilight meadows 
0	helping all urchin blasts and ill luck signs
0	that the shrewd meddling elf delights to make 
0	which she with precious vialed liquors heals 
0	for which the shepherds at their festivals 
0	carol her goodness loud in rustic lays 
0	and throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream
0	of pansies pinks and gaudy daffodils 
0	and as the old swain said she can unlock
0	the clasping charm and thaw the numbing spell 
0	if she be right invoked in warbled song 
0	for maidenhood she loves and will be swift
0	to aid a virgin such as was herself 
0	in hard besetting need this will i try 
0	and add the power of some adjuring verse 
0	sabrina fair

0	under the glassy cool translucent wave 
0	in twisted braids of lilies knitting

0	and with forced fingers rude
0	shatter your leaves before the mellowing year 
0	bitter constraint and sad occasion dear
0	compels me to disturb your season due 
0	for lycidas is dead dead ere his prime 
0	young lycidas and hath not left his peer 
0	who would not sing for lycidas he knew
0	himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme 
0	he must not float upon his watery bier
0	unwept and welter to the parching wind 
0	without the meed of some melodious tear 
0	begin then sisters of the sacred well
0	that from beneath the seat of jove doth spring 
0	begin and somewhat loudly sweep the string 
0	hence with denial vain and coy excuse 
0	so may some gentle muse
0	with lucky words favour my destined urn 
0	and as he passes turn 
0	and bid fair peace be to my sable shroud 
0	for we were nursed upon the self same hill 
0	fed the same flock by fountain shade and rill 
0	together both ere the high lawns appeared
0	under the opening eyelids of the morn 
0	we drove a field and both together heard
0	what time the grey fly winds her sultry horn 
0	battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night 
0	oft till the star that rose at evening bright
0	toward heaven s descent had sloped his westering wheel 
0	meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute 
0	tempered to the oaten flute 
0	rough satyrs danced and fauns with cloven heel
0	from the glad sound would not be absent long 
0	and old damoetas loved to hear our song 
0	but oh the heavy change now thou art gone 
0	now thou art gone and never must return 
0	thee shepherd thee the woods and desert caves 
0	with wild thyme and the gadding vine o ergrown 
0	and all their echoes mourn 
0	the willows and the hazel copses green 
0	shall now no more be seen
0	fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays 
0	as killing as the canker to the rose 
0	or taint worm to the weanling herds that graze 
0	or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear 
0	when first the white thorn blows 
0	such lycidas thy loss to shepherd s ear 
0	where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep
0	closed o er the head of your loved lycidas 
0	for neither were ye playing on the steep
0	where your old bards the famous druids lie 
0	nor on the shaggy top of mona high 
0	nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream 
0	ay me i fondly dream
0	rhad ye been there s for what could that have done 
0	what could the muse herself that orpheus bore 
0	the muse herself for her enchanting son 
0	whom universal nature did lament 
0	when by the rout that made the hideous roar 
0	his gory visage down the stream was sent 
0	down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore 
0	alas what boots it with uncessant care
0	to tend the homely slighted shepherd s trade 
0	and strictly meditate the thankless muse 
0	were it not better done as others use 
0	to sport with amaryllis in the shade 
0	or with the tangles of neaera s hair 
0	fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
0	 that last infirmity of noble mind 
0	to scorn delights and live laborious days 
0	but the fair guerdon when we hope to find 
0	and think to burst out into sudden blaze 
0	comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears 
0	and slits the thin spun life but not the praise 
0	phoebus replied and touched my trembling ears 
0	 fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil 
0	nor in the glistering foil
0	set off to the world nor in broad rumour lies 
0	but lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes
0	and perfect witness of all judging jove 
0	as he pronounces lastly on each deed 
0	of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed 
0	o fountain arethuse and thou honoured flood 
0	smooth sliding mincius crowned with vocal reeds 
0	that strain i heard was of a higher mood 
0	but now my oat proceeds 
0	and listens to the herald of the sea 
0	that came in neptune s plea 
0	he asked the waves and asked the felon winds 
0	what hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain 
0	and questioned every gust of rugged wings
0	that blows from off each beaked promontory 
0	they knew not of his story 
0	and sage hippotades their answer brings 
0	that not a blast was from his dungeon strayed 
0	the air was calm and on the level brine
0	sleek panope with all her sisters played 
0	it was that fatal and perfidious bark 
0	built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark 
0	that sunk so low that sacred head of thine 
0	next camus reverend sire went footing slow 
0	his mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge 
0	inwrought with figures dim and on the edge
0	like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe 
0	 ah who hath reft quoth he my dearest pledge 
0	last came and last did go 
0	two massy keys he bore of metals twain 
0	 the golden opes the iron shuts amain 
0	he shook his mitred locks and stern bespake 
0	 how well could i have spared for thee young swain 
0	enow of such as for their bellies sake 
0	creep and intrude and climb into the fold 
0	of other care they little reckoning make
0	than how to scramble at the shearers feast 
0	and shove away the worthy bidden guest 
0	blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold
0	a sheep hook or have learnt aught else the least
0	that to the faithful herdman s art belongs 
0	what recks it them what need they they are sped 
0	and when they list their lean and flashy songs
0	grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw 
0	the hungry sheep look up and are not fed 
0	but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw 
0	rot inwardly and foul contagion spread 
0	besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
0	daily devours apace and nothing said 
0	but that two handed engine at the door
0	stands ready to smite once and smite no more 
0	return alpheus the dread voice is past
0	that shrunk thy streams return sicilian muse 
0	and call the vales and bid them hither cast
0	their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues 
0	ye valleys low where the mild whispers use
0	of shades and wanton winds and gushing brooks 
0	on whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks 
0	throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes 
0	that on the green turf suck the honeyed showers 
0	and purple all the ground with vernal flowers 
0	bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies 
0	the tufted crow toe and pale jessamine 
0	the white pink and the pansy freaked with jet 
0	the glowing violet 
0	the musk rose and the well attired woodbine 
0	with cowslips wan that hang the pensive head 
0	and every flower that sad embroidery wears 
0	bid amaranthus all his beauty shed 
0	and daffadillies fill their cups with tears 
0	to strew the laureate hearse where lycid lies 
0	for so to interpose a little ease 
0	let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise 
0	ay me whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
0	wash far away where er thy bones are hurled 
0	whether beyond the stormy hebrides 
0	where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
0	visit st the bottom of the monstrous world 
0	or whether thou to our moist vows denied 
0	sleep st by the fable of bellerus old 
0	where the great vision of the guarded mount
0	looks toward namancos and bayona s hold 
0	look homeward angel now and melt with ruth 
0	and o ye dolphins waft the hapless youth 
0	weep no more woeful shepherds weep no more 
0	for lycidas your sorrow is not dead 
0	sunk though he be beneath the watery floor 
0	so sinks the day star in the ocean bed 
0	and yet anon repairs his drooping head 
0	and tricks his beams and with new spangled ore
0	flames in the forehead of the morning sky 
0	so lycidas sunk low but mounted high 
0	through the dear might of him that walked the waves 
0	where other groves and other streams along 
0	with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves 
0	and hears the unexpressive nuptial song 
0	in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love 
0	there entertain him all the saints above 
0	in solemn troops and sweet societies 
0	that sing and singing in their glory move 
0	and wipe the tears for ever from his eyes 
0	now lycidas the shepherds weep no more 
0	henceforth thou art the genius of the shore 
0	in thy large recompense and shalt be good
0	to all that wander in that perilous flood 
0	thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills 
0	while the still morn went out with sandals grey 
0	he touched the tender stops of various quills 
0	with eager thought warbling his doric lay 
0	and now the sun had stretched out all the hills 
0	and now was dropt into the western bay 
0	at last he rose and twitched his mantle blue 
0	tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new 
0	beneath the hollow round
0	on the morning of christ s nativity
0	in the puritan theology and its implications he cannot take much
0	evidently the father thought he saw in his son that promise of
0	intellectual vigor and of sound moral stamina which justified the
0	returning at the close of his university course to the paternal
0	memorable among his italian experiences was his visit to the aged
0	all students of milton have to acknowledge their indebtedness to
0	this is the month and this the happy morn 
0	wherein the son of heaven s eternal king 
0	of wedded maid and virgin mother born 
0	our great redemption from above did bring 
0	for so the holy sages once did sing 
0	that he our deadly forfeit should release 
0	and with his father work us a perpetual peace 
0	that glorious form that light unsufferable 
0	and that far beaming blaze of majesty 
0	wherewith he wont at heaven s high council table
0	to sit the midst of trinal unity 
0	he laid aside and here with us to be 
0	forsook the courts of everlasting day 
0	and chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay 
0	say heavenly muse shall not thy sacred vein
0	afford a present to the infant god 
0	hast thou no verse no hymn or solemn strain 
0	to welcome him to this his new abode 
0	now while the heaven by the sun s team untrod 
0	hath took no print of the approaching light 
0	and all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright 
0	see how from far upon the eastern road
0	the star led wizards haste with odors sweet 
0	oh run prevent them with thy humble ode 
0	and lay it lowly at his blessed feet 
0	have thou the honor first thy lord to greet 
0	and join thy voice unto the angel quire 
0	from out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire 
0	it was the winter wild 
0	while the heaven born child
0	all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies 
0	nature in awe to him 
0	had doffed her gaudy trim 
0	with her great master so to sympathize 
0	it was no season then for her
0	to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour 
0	only with speeches fair
0	she woos the gentle air
0	to hide her guilty front with innocent snow 
0	and on her naked shame 
0	pollute with sinful blame 
0	the saintly veil of maiden white to throw 
0	confounded that her maker s eyes
0	should look so near upon her foul deformities 
0	but he her fears to cease 
0	sent down the meek eyed peace 
0	she crowned with olive green came softly sliding
0	down through the turning sphere 
0	his ready harbinger 
0	with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing 
0	and waving wide her myrtle wand 
0	she strikes a universal peace through sea and land 
0	no war or battle s sound 
0	was heard the world around 
0	the idle spear and shield were high uphung 
0	the hooked chariot stood 
0	unstained with hostile blood 
0	the trumpet spake not to the armed throng 
0	and kings sat still with awful eye 
0	as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by 
0	but peaceful was the night
0	his reign of peace upon the earth began 
0	the winds with wonder whist 
0	smoothly the waters kissed 
0	whispering new joys to the mild ocean 
0	who now hath quite forgot to rave 
0	while birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave 
0	the stars with deep amaze 
0	stand fixed in steadfast gaze 
0	bending one way their precious influence 
0	and will not take their flight 
0	for all the morning light 
0	or lucifer that often warned them thence 
0	but in their glimmering orbs did glow 
0	until their lord himself bespake and bid them go 
0	and though the shady gloom
0	had given day her room 
0	the sun himself withheld his wonted speed 
0	and hid his head for shame 
0	as his inferior flame
0	the new enlightened world no more should need 
0	he saw a greater sun appear
0	than his bright throne or burning axletree could bear 
0	the shepherds on the lawn 
0	or ere the point of dawn 
0	sat simply chatting in a rustic row 
0	full little thought they than
0	that the mighty pan
0	was kindly come to live with them below 
0	perhaps their loves or else their sheep 
0	was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep 
0	when such music sweet
0	their hearts and ears did greet
0	as never was by mortal finger strook 
0	divinely warbled voice
0	answering the stringed noise 
0	as all their souls in blissful rapture took 
0	the air such pleasure loth to lose 
0	with thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close 
0	nature that heard such sound
0	of cynthia s seat the airy region thrilling 
0	now was almost won
0	to think her part was done 
0	and that her reign had here its last fulfilling 
0	she knew such harmony alone
0	could hold all heaven and earth in happier union 
0	at last surrounds their sight
0	a globe of circular light 
0	that with long beams the shamefaced night arrayed 
0	the helmed cherubim
0	and sworded seraphim
0	are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed 
0	harping in loud and solemn quire 
0	with unexpressive notes to heaven s new born heir 
0	such music as tis said 
0	before was never made 
0	but when of old the sons of morning sung 
0	while the creator great
0	his constellations set 
0	and the well balanced world on hinges hung 
0	and cast the dark foundations deep 
0	and bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep 
0	ring out ye crystal spheres 
0	once bless our human ears 
0	if ye have power to touch our senses so 
0	and let your silver chime
0	move in melodious time 
0	and let the bass of heaven s deep organ blow 
0	and with your ninefold harmony
0	make up full consort to the angelic symphony 
0	for if such holy song
0	enwrap our fancy long 
0	time will run back and fetch the age of gold 
0	and speckled vanity
0	will sicken soon and die 
0	and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould 
0	and hell itself will pass away 
0	and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day 
0	yea truth and justice then
0	will down return to men 
0	orbed in a rainbow and like glories wearing 
0	mercy will sit between 
0	throned in celestial sheen 
0	with radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering 
0	and heaven as at some festival 
0	will open wide the gates of her high palace hall 
0	but wisest fate says no 
0	this must not yet be so 
0	the babe yet lies in smiling infancy
0	that on the bitter cross
0	must redeem our loss 
0	so both himself and us to glorify 
0	yet first to those ychained in sleep 
0	the wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep 
0	with such a horrid clang
0	as on mount sinai rang 
0	while the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake 
0	the aged earth aghast
0	with terror of that blast 
0	shall from the surface to the centre shake 
0	when at the world s last session 
0	the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne 
0	and then at last our bliss
0	full and perfect is 
0	but now begins for from this happy day
0	the old dragon under ground 
0	in straiter limits bound 
0	not half so far casts his usurped sway 
0	and wroth to see his kingdom fail 
0	swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail 
0	no voice or hideous hum
0	runs through the arched roof in words deceiving 
0	apollo from his shrine
0	can no more divine 
0	with hollow shriek the steep of delphos leaving 
0	no nightly trance or breathed spell 
0	inspires the pale eyed priest from the prophetic cell 
0	the lonely mountains o er 
0	and the resounding shore 
0	a voice of weeping heard and loud lament 
0	from haunted spring and dale
0	edged with poplar pale 
0	the parting genius is with sighing sent 
0	with flower inwoven tresses torn
0	the nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn 
0	in consecrated earth 
0	and on the holy hearth 
0	the lars and lemures moan with midnight plaint 
0	in urns and altars round 
0	a drear and dying sound
0	affrights the flamens at their service quaint 
0	and the chill marble seems to sweat 
0	while each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat 
0	forsake their temples dim 
0	with that twice battered god of palestine 
0	and mooned ashtaroth 
0	heaven s queen and mother both 
0	now sits not girt with tapers holy shine 
0	the lybic hammon shrinks his horn 
0	in vain the tyrian maids their wounded thammuz mourn 
0	and sullen moloch fled 
0	hath left in shadows dread
0	his burning idol all of blackest hue 
0	in vain with cymbals ring
0	they call the grisly king 
0	in dismal dance about the furnace blue 
0	the brutish gods of nile as fast 
0	isis and orus and the dog anubis haste 
0	nor is osiris seen
0	in memphian grove or green 
0	trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud 
0	nor can he be at rest
0	within his sacred chest 
0	nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud 
0	in vain with timbrelled anthems dark 
0	the sable stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark 
0	he feels from juda s land
0	the dreaded infant s hand 
0	the rays of bethlehem blind his dusky eyn 
0	nor all the gods beside
0	longer dare abide 
0	not typhon huge ending in snaky twine 
0	our babe to show his godhead true 
0	can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew 
0	so when the sun in bed 
0	curtained with cloudy red 
0	pillows his chin upon an orient wave 
0	the flocking shadows pale
0	troop to the infernal jail 
0	each fettered ghost slips to his several grave 
0	and the yellow skirted fays
0	fly after the night steeds leaving their moon loved maze 
0	but see the virgin blest
0	hath laid her babe to rest 
0	time is our tedious song should here have ending 
0	heaven s youngest teemed star
0	hath fixed her polished car 
0	her sleeping lord with handmaid lamp attending 
0	and all about the courtly stable
0	bright harnessed angels sit in order serviceable 
0	what needs my shakespeare for his honored bones
0	the labor of an age in piled stones 
0	or that his hallowed reliques should be hid
0	under a star ypointing pyramid 
0	dear son of memory great heir of fame 
0	what need st thou such weak witness of thy name 
0	thou in our wonder and astonishment
0	hast built thyself a livelong monument 
0	for whilst to the shame of slow endeavoring art
0	thy easy numbers flow and that each heart
0	hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book
0	those delphic lines with deep impression took 
0	then thou our fancy of itself bereaving 
0	dost make us marble with too much conceiving 
0	and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie
0	that kings for such a tomb would wish to die 
0	hence loathed melancholy 
0	of cerberus and blackest midnight born
0	in stygian cave forlorn
0	 mongst horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy 
0	find out some uncouth cell 
0	where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings 
0	and the night raven sings 
0	there under ebon shades and low browed rocks 
0	as ragged as thy locks 
0	in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell 
0	but come thou goddess fair and free 
0	in heaven yclept euphrosyne 
0	and by men heart easing mirth 
0	whom lovely venus at a birth 
0	with two sister graces more 
0	to ivy crowned bacchus bore 
0	or whether as some sager sing 
0	the frolic wind that breathes the spring 
0	zephyr with aurora playing 
0	as he met her once a maying 
0	there on beds of violets blue 
0	and fresh blown roses washed in dew 
0	filled her with thee a daughter fair 
0	so buxom blithe and debonair 
0	haste thee nymph and bring with thee
0	jest and youthful jollity 
0	quips and cranks and wanton wiles 
0	nods and becks and wreathed smiles 
0	such as hang on hebe s cheek 
0	and love to live in dimple sleek 
0	sport that wrinkled care derides 
0	and laughter holding both his sides 
0	come and trip it as you go 
0	on the light fantastic toe 
0	and in thy right hand lead with thee
0	the mountain nymph sweet liberty 
0	and if i give thee honor due 
0	mirth admit me of thy crew 
0	to live with her and live with thee 
0	in unreproved pleasures free 
0	to hear the lark begin his flight 
0	and singing startle the dull night 
0	from his watch tower in the skies 
0	till the dappled dawn doth rise 
0	then to come in spite of sorrow 
0	and at my window bid good morrow 
0	through the sweet briar or the vine 
0	or the twisted eglantine 
0	while the cock with lively din 
0	scatters the rear of darkness thin 
0	and to the stack or the barn door 
0	stoutly struts his dames before 
0	oft listening how the hounds and horn
0	cheerly rouse the slumbering morn 
0	from the side of some hoar hill 
0	through the high wood echoing shrill 
0	sometime walking not unseen 
0	by hedgerow elms on hillocks green 
0	right against the eastern gate
0	where the great sun begins his state 
0	robed in flames and amber light 
0	the clouds in thousand liveries dight 
0	while the ploughman near at hand 
0	whistles o er the furrowed land 
0	and the milkmaid singeth blithe 
0	and the mower whets his scythe 
0	and every shepherd tells his tale
0	under the hawthorn in the dale 
0	straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures 
0	whilst the landskip round it measures 
0	russet lawns and fallows gray 
0	where the nibbling flocks do stray 
0	mountains on whose barren breast
0	the laboring clouds do often rest 
0	meadows trim with daisies pied 
0	shallow brooks and rivers wide 
0	towers and battlements it sees
0	bosomed high in tufted trees 
0	where perhaps some beauty lies 
0	the cynosure of neighboring eyes 
0	hard by a cottage chimney smokes
0	from betwixt two aged oaks 
0	are at their savory dinner set
0	of herbs and other country messes 
0	which the neat handed phyllis dresses 
0	and then in haste her bower she leaves 
0	with thestylis to bind the sheaves 
0	or if the earlier season lead 
0	to the tanned haycock in the mead 
0	sometimes with secure delight 
0	the upland hamlets will invite 
0	when the merry bells ring round 
0	and the jocund rebecks sound
0	to many a youth and many a maid
0	dancing in the chequered shade 
0	and young and old come forth to play
0	on a sunshine holiday 
0	till the livelong daylight fail 
0	then to the spicy nut brown ale 
0	with stories told of many a feat 
0	how faery mab the junkets eat 
0	she was pinched and pulled she said 
0	and he by friar s lantern led 
0	tells how the drudging goblin sweat
0	to earn his cream bowl duly set 
0	when in one night ere glimpse of morn 
0	his shadowy flail hath threshed the corn
0	that ten day laborers could not end 
0	then lies him down the lubber fiend 
0	and stretched out all the chimney s length 
0	basks at the fire his hairy strength 
0	and crop full out of doors he flings 
0	ere the first cock his matin rings 
0	thus done the tales to bed they creep 
0	by whispering winds soon lulled asleep 
0	towered cities please us then 
0	and the busy hum of men 
0	where throngs of knights and barons bold 
0	in weeds of peace high triumphs hold 
0	with store of ladies whose bright eyes
0	rain influence and judge the prize
0	of wit or arms while both contend
0	to win her grace whom all commend 
0	there let hymen oft appear
0	in saffron robe with taper clear 
0	and pomp and feast and revelry 
0	with mask and antique pageantry 
0	such sights as youthful poets dream 
0	on summer eves by haunted stream 
0	then to the well trod stage anon 
0	if jonson s learned sock be on 
0	or sweetest shakespeare fancy s child 
0	warble his native wood notes wild 
0	and ever against eating cares 
0	lap me in soft lydian airs 
0	married to immortal verse 
0	such as the meeting soul may pierce 
0	in notes with many a winding bout
0	of linked sweetness long drawn out
0	with wanton heed and giddy cunning 
0	the melting voice through mazes running 
0	untwisting all the chains that tie
0	the hidden soul of harmony 
0	that orpheus self may heave his head
0	from golden slumber on a bed
0	of heaped elysian flowers and hear
0	such strains as would have won the ear
0	of pluto to have quite set free
0	his half regained eurydice 
0	these delights if thou canst give 
0	mirth with thee i mean to live 
0	hence vain deluding joys 
0	the brood of folly without father bred 
0	how little you bested 
0	or fill the fixed mind with all your toys 
0	dwell in some idle brain 
0	and fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess 
0	as thick and numberless
0	as the gay motes that people the sun beams 
0	or likest hovering dreams 
0	the fickle pensioners of morpheus train 
0	but hail thou goddess sage and holy 
0	hail divinest melancholy 
0	whose saintly visage is too bright
0	to hit the sense of human sight 
0	and therefore to our weaker view 
0	o erlaid with black staid wisdom s hue 
0	black but such as in esteem
0	prince memnon s sister might beseem 
0	or that starred ethiop queen that strove
0	to set her beauty s praise above
0	the sea nymphs and their powers offended 
0	yet thou art higher far descended 
0	thee bright haired vesta long of yore
0	to solitary saturn bore 
0	his daughter she in saturn s reign
0	such mixture was not held a stain 
0	oft in glimmering bowers and glades
0	he met her and in secret shades
0	of woody ida s inmost grove 
0	whilst yet there was no fear of jove 
0	come pensive nun devout and pure 
0	sober steadfast and demure 
0	all in a robe of darkest grain 
0	flowing with majestic train 
0	and sable stole of cypress lawn
0	over thy decent shoulders drawn 
0	come but keep thy wonted state 
0	with even step and musing gait 
0	and looks commercing with the skies
0	thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes 
0	there held in holy passion still 
0	forget thyself to marble till
0	with a sad leaden downward cast
0	thou fix them on the earth as fast 
0	and join with thee calm peace and quiet 
0	spare fast that oft with gods doth diet 
0	and hears the muses in a ring
0	aye round about jove s altar sing 
0	and add to these retired leisure 
0	that in trim gardens takes his pleasure 
0	but first and chiefest with thee bring
0	him that yon soars on golden wing 
0	guiding the fiery wheeled throne 
0	and the mute silence hist along 
0	 less philomel will deign a song 
0	in her sweetest saddest plight 
0	smoothing the rugged brow of night 
0	while cynthia checks her dragon yoke
0	gently o er the accustomed oak 
0	sweet bird that shunn st the noise of folly 
0	most musical most melancholy 
0	thee chauntress oft the woods among
0	i woo to hear thy even song 
0	and missing thee i walk unseen
0	on the dry smooth shaven green 
0	to behold the wandering moon 
0	riding near her highest noon 
0	like one that had been led astray
0	through the heaven s wide pathless way 
0	and oft as if her head she bowed 
0	stooping through a fleecy cloud 
0	oft on a plat of rising ground 
0	i hear the far off curfew sound 
0	over some wide watered shore 
0	swinging slow with sullen roar 
0	or if the air will not permit 
0	some still removed place will fit 
0	where glowing embers through the room
0	teach light to counterfeit a gloom 
0	far from all resort of mirth 
0	save the cricket on the hearth 
0	or the bellman s drowsy charm
0	to bless the doors from nightly harm 
0	or let my lamp at midnight hour 
0	be seen in some high lonely tower 
0	with thrice great hermes or unsphere
0	the spirit of plato to unfold
0	what worlds or what vast regions hold
0	the immortal mind that hath forsook
0	her mansion in this fleshly nook 
0	and of those demons that are found
0	in fire air flood or underground 
0	whose power hath a true consent
0	with planet or with element 
0	sometime let gorgeous tragedy
0	in sceptred pall come sweeping by 
0	presenting thebes or pelops line 
0	or the tale of troy divine 
0	or what though rare of later age
0	ennobled hath the buskined stage 
0	but o sad virgin that thy power
0	might raise musaeus from his bower 
0	or bid the soul of orpheus sing
0	such notes as warbled to the string 
0	drew iron tears down pluto s cheek 
0	and made hell grant what love did seek 
0	or call up him that left half told
0	the story of cambuscan bold 
0	and who had canace to wife 
0	that owned the virtuous ring and glass 
0	and of the wondrous horse of brass
0	on which the tartar king did ride 
0	and if aught else great bards beside
0	in sage and solemn tunes have sung 
0	of turneys and of trophies hung 
0	of forests and enchantments drear 
0	where more is meant than meets the ear 
0	thus night oft see me in thy pale career 
0	till civil suited morn appear 
0	not tricked and frounced as she was wont
0	with the attic boy to hunt 
0	but kerchieft in a comely cloud 
0	while rocking winds are piping loud
0	or ushered with a shower still 
0	when the gust hath blown his fill 
0	ending on the rustling leaves 
0	with minute drops from off the eaves 
0	and when the sun begins to fling
0	his flaring beams me goddess bring
0	to arched walks of twilight groves 
0	and shadows brown that sylvan loves 
0	of pine or monumental oak 
0	where the rude axe with heaved stroke
0	was never heard the nymphs to daunt 
0	or fright them from their hallowed haunt 
0	there in close covert by some brook 
0	where no profaner eye may look 
0	hide me from day s garish eye 
0	while the bee with honeyed thigh 
0	that at her flowery work doth sing 
0	and the waters murmuring 
0	with such consort as they keep 
0	entice the dewy feathered sleep 
0	and let some strange mysterious dream
0	wave at his wings in airy stream
0	of lively portraiture displayed 
0	softly on my eyelids laid 
0	and as i wake sweet music breathe
0	above about or underneath 
0	sent by some spirit to mortals good 
0	or the unseen genius of the wood 
0	but let my due feet never fail
0	to walk the studious cloister s pale 
0	and love the high embowed roof 
0	with antique pillars massy proof 
0	and storied windows richly dight 
0	casting a dim religious light 
0	there let the pealing organ blow 
0	to the full voiced quire below 
0	in service high and anthems clear 
0	as may with sweetness through mine ear 
0	dissolve me into ecstasies 
0	and bring all heaven before mine eyes 
0	and may at last my weary age
0	find out the peaceful hermitage 
0	the hairy gown and mossy cell 
0	where i may sit and rightly spell
0	of every star that heaven doth shew 
0	and every herb that sips the dew 
0	till old experience do attain
0	to something like prophetic strain 
0	these pleasures melancholy give 
0	and i with thee will choose to live 
0	look nymphs and shepherds look 
0	what sudden blaze of majesty
0	is that which we from hence descry 
0	too divine to be mistook 
0	this this is she
0	to whom our vows and wishes bend 
0	here our solemn search hath end 
0	fame that her high worth to raise
0	seemed erst so lavish and profuse 
0	we may justly now accuse
0	of detraction from her praise 
0	less than half we find expressed 
0	envy bid conceal the rest 
0	mark what radiant state she spreads 
0	in circle round her shining throne
0	shooting her beams like silver threads 
0	this this is she alone 
0	sitting like a goddess bright
0	in the centre of her light 
0	might she the wise latona be 
0	or the towered cybele 
0	mother of a hundred gods 
0	juno dares not give her odds 
0	who had thought this clime had held
0	a deity so unparalleled 
0	as they come forward the genius of the wood appears 
0	and turning toward them speaks 
0	 gen stay gentle swains for though in this disguise 
0	i see bright honor sparkle through your eyes 
0	of famous arcady ye are and sprung
0	of that renowned flood so often sung 
0	divine alpheus who by secret sluice 
0	stole under seas to meet his arethuse 
0	and ye the breathing roses of the wood 
0	fair silver buskined nymphs as great and good 
0	i know this quest of yours and free intent
0	was all in honor and devotion meant
0	to the great mistress of yon princely shrine 
0	whom with low reverence i adore as mine 
0	and with all helpful service will comply
0	to further this night s glad solemnity 
0	and lead ye where ye may more near behold
0	what shallow searching fame hath left untold 
0	which i full oft amidst those shades alone 
0	have sat to wonder at and gaze upon 
0	for know by lot from jove i am the power
0	of this fair wood and live in oaken bower 
0	to nurse the saplings tall and curl the grove
0	with ringlets quaint and wanton windings wove 
0	and all my plants i save from nightly ill
0	of noisome winds and blasting vapors chill 
0	and from the boughs brush off the evil dew 
0	and heal the harms of thwarting thunder blue 
0	or what the cross dire looking planet smites 
0	or hurtful worm with cankered venom bites 
0	when evening gray doth rise i fetch my round
0	over the mount and all this hallowed ground 
0	and early ere the odorous breath of morn
0	awakes the slumbering leaves or tasselled horn
0	shakes the high thicket haste i all about 
0	number my ranks and visit every sprout
0	with puissant words and murmurs made to bless 
0	but else in deep of night when drowsiness
0	hath locked up mortal sense then listen i
0	to the celestial sirens harmony 
0	that sit upon the nine infolded spheres 
0	and sing to those that hold the vital shears 
0	and turn the adamantine spindle round
0	on which the fate of gods and men is wound 
0	such sweet compulsion doth in music lie 
0	to lull the daughters of necessity 
0	and keep unsteady nature to her law 
0	and the low world in measured motion draw
0	after the heavenly tune which none can hear
0	of human mould with gross unpurged ear 
0	and yet such music worthiest were to blaze
0	the peerless height of her immortal praise
0	whose lustre leads us and for her most fit 
0	if my inferior hand or voice could hit
0	inimitable sounds yet as we go 
0	whate er the skill of lesser gods can show
0	i will assay her worth to celebrate 
0	and so attend ye toward her glittering state 
0	where ye may all that are of noble stem 
0	approach and kiss her sacred vesture s hem 
0	o er the smooth enamelled green 
0	where no print of step hath been 
0	follow me as i sing
0	and touch the warbled string 
0	under the shady roof
0	of branching elm star proof
0	i will bring you where she sits 
0	clad in splendor as befits
0	her deity 
0	such a rural queen
0	all arcadia hath not seen 
0	nymphs and shepherds dance no more
0	by sandy ladon s lilied banks 
0	on old lycaeus or cyllene hoar 
0	trip no more in twilight ranks 
0	though erymanth your loss deplore 
0	a better soil shall give ye thanks 
0	from the stony maenalus
0	bring your flocks and live with us 
0	here ye shall have greater grace 
0	to serve the lady of this place 
0	though syrinx your pan s mistress were 
0	yet syrinx well might wait on her 
0	such a rural queen
0	all arcadia hath not seen 
0	blest pair of sirens pledges of heaven s joy 
0	sphere born harmonious sisters voice and verse 
0	wed your divine sounds and mixed power employ 
0	dead things with inbreathed sense able to pierce 
0	and to our high raised phantasy present
0	that undisturbed song of pure concent 
0	aye sung before the sapphire colored throne
0	to him that sits thereon 
0	with saintly shout and solemn jubilee 
0	where the bright seraphim in burning row
0	their loud uplifted angel trumpets blow 
0	and the cherubic host in thousand quires
0	touch their immortal harps of golden wires 
0	with those just spirits that wear victorious palms 
0	hymns devout and holy psalms
0	singing everlastingly 
0	that we on earth with undiscording voice 
0	may rightly answer that melodious noise 
0	as once we did till disproportioned sin
0	jarred against nature s chime and with harsh din
0	broke the fair music that all creatures made
0	to their great lord whose love their motion swayed
0	in perfect diapason whilst they stood
0	in first obedience and their state of good 
0	o may we soon again renew that song 
0	and keep in tune with heaven till god ere long
0	to his celestial consort us unite 
0	to live with him and sing in endless morn of light 
0	the attendant spirit afterwards in the habit of thyrsis 
0	comus with his crew 
0	the first scene discovers a wild wood 
0	the attendant spirit descends or enters 
0	 spirit before the starry threshold of jove s court
0	my mansion is where those immortal shapes
0	of bright aerial spirits live insphered
0	in regions mild of calm and serene air 
0	above the smoke and stir of this dim spot
0	which men call earth and with low thoughted care 
0	confined and pestered in this pinfold here 
0	strive to keep up a frail and feverish being 
0	unmindful of the crown that virtue gives 
0	after this mortal change to her true servants
0	amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats 
0	yet some there be that by due steps aspire
0	to lay their just hands on that golden key
0	that opes the palace of eternity 
0	to such my errand is and but for such 
0	i would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds
0	with the rank vapors of this sin worn mould 
0	but to my task neptune besides the sway
0	of every salt flood and each ebbing stream
0	took in by lot twixt high and nether jove 
0	imperial rule of all the sea girt isles
0	that like to rich and various gems inlay
0	the unadorned bosom of the deep 
0	which he to grace his tributary gods 
0	by course commits to several government 
0	and gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns
0	and wield their little tridents but this isle 
0	the greatest and the best of all the main 
0	he quarters to his blue haired deities 
0	and all this tract that fronts the falling sun
0	a noble peer of mickle trust and power
0	has in his charge with tempered awe to guide
0	an old and haughty nation proud in arms 
0	where his fair offspring nursed in princely lore 
0	are coming to attend their father s state 
0	and new intrusted sceptre but their way
0	lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood 
0	the nodding horror of those shady brows
0	threats the forlorn and wandering passenger 
0	and here their tender age might suffer peril 
0	but that by quick command from sovran jove 
0	i was despatched for their defence and guard 
0	and listen why for i will tell you now
0	what never yet was heard in tale or song 
0	from old or modern bard in hall or bower

0	and hearken if i may her business hear 
0	the lady enters 
0	 lady this way the noise was if mine ear be true 
0	my best guide now methought it was the sound
0	of riot and ill managed merriment 
0	such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe
0	stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds 
0	when for their teeming flocks and granges full 
0	in wanton dance they praise the bounteous pan 
0	and thank the gods amiss i should be loth
0	to meet the rudeness and swilled insolence
0	of such late wassailers yet oh where else
0	shall i inform my unacquainted feet
0	in the blind mazes of this tangled wood 
0	my brothers when they saw me wearied out
0	with this long way resolving here to lodge
0	under the spreading favor of these pines 
0	stepped as they said to the next thicket side
0	to bring me berries or such cooling fruit
0	as the kind hospitable woods provide 
0	they left me then when the gray hooded even 
0	like a sad votarist in palmer s weed 
0	rose from the hindmost wheels of phoebus wain 
0	but where they are and why they came not back 
0	is now the labor of my thoughts tis likeliest
0	they had engaged their wandering steps too far 
0	and envious darkness ere they could return 
0	had stole them from me else o thievish night 
0	why shouldst thou but for some felonious end 
0	in thy dark lantern thus close up the stars
0	that nature hung in heaven and filled their lamps
0	with everlasting oil to give due light
0	to the misled and lonely traveller 
0	this is the place as well as i may guess 
0	whence even now the tumult of loud mirth
0	was rife and perfect in my listening ear 
0	yet nought but single darkness do i find 
0	what might this be a thousand fantasies
0	begin to throng into my memory 
0	of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire 
0	and airy tongues that syllable men s names
0	on sands and shores and desert wildernesses 
0	these thoughts may startle well but not astound
0	the virtuous mind that ever walks attended
0	by a strong siding champion conscience 
0	o welcome pure eyed faith white handed hope 
0	thou hovering angel girt with golden wings 
0	and thou unblemished form of chastity 
0	i see thee visibly and now believe
0	that he the supreme good to whom all things ill
0	are but as slavish officers of vengeance 
0	would send a glistering guardian if need were 
0	to keep my life and honor unassailed 
0	was i deceived or did a sable cloud

0	to testify his hidden residence 
0	how sweetly did they float upon the wings
0	of silence through the empty vaulted night 
0	at every fall smoothing the raven down
0	of darkness till it smiled i have oft heard
0	my mother circe with the sirens three 
0	amidst the flowery kirtled naiades 
0	culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs 
0	who as they sung would take the prisoned soul 
0	and lap it in elysium scylla wept 
0	and chid her barking waves into attention 
0	and fell charybdis murmured soft applause 
0	yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense 
0	and in sweet madness robbed it of itself

0	that is addressed to unattending ears

0	in his loose traces from the furrow came 
0	and the swinked hedger at his supper sat 
0	i saw them under a green mantling vine 
0	that crawls along the side of yon small hill 
0	plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots 
0	their port was more than human as they stood 
0	i took it for a faery vision
0	of some gay creatures of the element 
0	that in the colors of the rainbow live 
0	and play i the plighted clouds i was awe strook

0	where may she wander now whither betake her
0	from the chill dew amongst rude burs and thistles

0	or if they be but false alarms of fear 
0	how bitter is such self delusion 
0	i do not think my sister so to seek 
0	or so unprincipled in virtue s book 
0	and the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever 
0	as that the single want of light and noise
0	 not being in danger as i trust she is not 
0	could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts 
0	and put them into misbecoming plight 
0	virtue could see to do what virtue would
0	by her own radiant light though sun and moon
0	were in the flat sea sunk and wisdom s self
0	oft seeks to sweet retired solitude 
0	where with her best nurse contemplation 
0	she plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings 
0	that in the various bustle of resort 
0	were all to ruffled and sometimes impaired 
0	he that has light within his own clear breast
0	may sit i the centre and enjoy bright day 
0	but he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
0	benighted walks under the mid day sun 
0	himself is his own dungeon 
0	 sec bro tis most true
0	that musing meditation most affects
0	the pensive secrecy of desert cell

0	his few books or his beads or maple dish

0	and spotted mountain pard but set at nought

0	and noble grace that dashed brute violence
0	with sudden adoration and blank awe 
0	so dear to heaven is saintly chastity
0	that when a soul is found sincerely so 
0	a thousand liveried angels lackey her

0	gave respite to the drowsy flighted steeds

0	brought to my mind a certain shepherd lad 
0	of small regard to see to yet well skilled
0	in every virtuous plant and healing herb
0	that spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray 
0	he loved me well and oft would beg me sing 
0	which when i did he on the tender grass
0	would sit and hearken even to ecstasy 
0	and in requital ope his leathern scrip 
0	and show me simples of a thousand names 
0	telling their strange and vigorous faculties 
0	amongst the rest a small unsightly root 
0	but of divine effect he culled me out 
0	the leaf was darkish and had prickles on it 
0	but in another country as he said 
0	bore a bright golden flower but not in this soil 
0	unknown and like esteemed and the dull swain
0	treads on it daily with his clouted shoon 
0	and yet more med cinal is it than that moly
0	that hermes once to wise ulysses gave 
0	he called it haemony and gave it me 
0	and bade me keep it as of sovran use
0	 gainst all enchantments mildew blast or damp 
0	or ghastly furies apparition 
0	i pursed it up but little reckoning made 
0	till now that this extremity compelled 
0	but now i find it true for by this means

0	entered the very lime twigs of his spells 
0	and yet came off if you have this about you

0	boldly assault the necromancer s hall 
0	where if he be with dauntless hardihood
0	and brandished blade rush on him break his glass 
0	and shed the luscious liquor on the ground 
0	but seize his wand though he and his curst crew
0	fierce sign of battle make and menace high 
0	or like the sons of vulcan vomit smoke 
0	yet will they soon retire if he but shrink 
0	 eld bro thyrsis lead on apace i ll follow thee

0	why should you be so cruel to yourself 
0	and to those dainty limbs which nature lent
0	for gentle usage and soft delicacy 
0	but you invert the covenants of her trust 
0	and harshly deal like an ill borrower 
0	with that which you received on other terms 
0	scorning the unexempt condition

0	consists in mutual and partaken bliss 
0	unsavory in the enjoyment of itself

0	and holy dictate of spare temperance 
0	if every just man that now pines with want
0	had but a moderate and beseeming share
0	of that which lewdly pampered luxury
0	now heaps upon some few with vast excess 
0	nature s full blessings would be well dispensed
0	in unsuperfluous even proportion

0	held up their pearled wrists and took her in 
0	bearing her straight to aged nereus hall

0	in nectared lavers strewed with asphodel 
0	and through the porch and inlet of each sense
0	dropt in ambrosial oils till she revived 
0	and underwent a quick immortal change 
0	made goddess of the river still she retains
0	her maiden gentleness and oft at eve
0	visits the herds along the twilight meadows 
0	helping all urchin blasts and ill luck signs
0	that the shrewd meddling elf delights to make 
0	which she with precious vialed liquors heals 
0	for which the shepherds at their festivals 
0	carol her goodness loud in rustic lays 
0	and throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream
0	of pansies pinks and gaudy daffodils 
0	and as the old swain said she can unlock
0	the clasping charm and thaw the numbing spell 
0	if she be right invoked in warbled song 
0	for maidenhood she loves and will be swift
0	to aid a virgin such as was herself 
0	in hard besetting need this will i try 
0	and add the power of some adjuring verse

0	so may some gentle muse
0	with lucky words favor my destined urn 
0	and as he passes turn 
0	and bid fair peace be to my sable shroud 
0	for we were nursed upon the self same hill 
0	fed the same flock by fountain shade and rill 
0	together both ere the high lawns appeared
0	under the opening eyelids of the morn 
0	we drove a field and both together heard
0	what time the gray fly winds her sultry horn 
0	battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night 
0	oft till the star that rose at evening bright
0	toward heaven s descent had sloped his westering wheel 
0	meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute 
0	tempered to the oaten flute
0	rough satyrs danced and fauns with cloven heel
0	from the glad sound would not be absent long 
0	and old damoetas loved to hear our song 
0	but oh the heavy change now thou art gone 
0	now thou art gone and never must return 
0	thee shepherd thee the woods and desert caves 
0	with wild thyme and the gadding vine o ergrown 
0	and all their echoes mourn 
0	the willows and the hazel copses green 
0	shall now no more be seen
0	fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays

0	what could the muse herself that orpheus bore 
0	the muse herself for her enchanting son 
0	whom universal nature did lament 
0	when by the rout that made the hideous roar 
0	his gory visage down the stream was sent 
0	down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore 
0	alas what boots it with uncessant care

0	to scorn delights and live laborious days

0	and think to burst out into sudden blaze 
0	comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears 
0	and slits the thin spun life but not the praise 
0	phoebus replied and touched my trembling ears 
0	 fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil 
0	nor in the glistering foil

0	what hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain 
0	and questioned every gust of rugged wings
0	that blows from off each beaked promontory

0	and sage hippotades their answer brings

0	the air was calm and on the level brine

0	built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark

0	inwrought with figures dim and on the edge
0	like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe 
0	 ah who hath reft quoth he my dearest pledge 
0	last came and last did go 
0	two massy keys he bore of metals twain
0	 the golden opes the iron shuts amain

0	enow of such as for their bellies sake 
0	creep and intrude and climb into the fold

0	and shove away the worthy bidden guest 
0	blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold
0	a sheep hook or have learnt aught else the least
0	that to the faithful herdman s art belongs

0	the hungry sheep look up and are not fed 
0	but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw 
0	rot inwardly and foul contagion spread 
0	besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
0	daily devours apace and nothing said 
0	but that two handed engine at the door
0	stands ready to smite once and smite no more 
0	return alpheus the dread voice is past
0	that shrunk thy streams return sicilian muse 
0	and call the vales and bid them hither cast
0	their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues 
0	ye valleys low where the mild whispers use
0	of shades and wanton winds and gushing brooks 
0	on whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks 
0	throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes 
0	that on the green turf suck the honeyed showers 
0	and purple all the ground with vernal flowers 
0	bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies 
0	the tufted crow toe and pale jessamine

0	the glowing violet 
0	the musk rose and the well attired woodbine

0	to strew the laureate hearse where lycid lies 
0	for so to interpose a little ease 
0	let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise 
0	ay me whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
0	wash far away where er thy bones are hurled 
0	whether beyond the stormy hebrides 
0	where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
0	visit st the bottom of the monstrous world 
0	or whether thou to our moist vows denied 
0	sleep st by the fable of bellerus old 
0	where the great vision of the guarded mount
0	looks toward namancos and bayona s hold 
0	look homeward angel now and melt with ruth 
0	and o ye dolphins waft the hapless youth 
0	weep no more woeful shepherds weep no more 
0	for lycidas your sorrow is not dead 
0	sunk though he be beneath the watery floor 
0	so sinks the day star in the ocean bed 
0	and yet anon repairs his drooping head 
0	and tricks his beams and with new spangled ore
0	flames in the forehead of the morning sky 
0	so lycidas sunk low but mounted high 
0	through the dear might of him that walked the waves 
0	where other groves and other streams along 
0	with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves 
0	and hears the unexpressive nuptial song 
0	in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love 
0	there entertain him all the saints above 
0	in solemn troops and sweet societies 
0	that sing and singing in their glory move 
0	and wipe the tears forever from his eyes 
0	now lycidas the shepherds weep no more 
0	henceforth thou art the genius of the shore 
0	in thy large recompense and shalt be good
0	to all that wander in that perilous flood

0	sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould
0	incapable of stain would soon expel

0	victorious thus repuls d our final hope

0	to be no more sad cure for who would loose 
0	though full of pain this intellectual being

0	in the wide womb of uncreated night 
0	devoid of sense and motion and who knows

0	is doubtful that he never will is sure

0	whatever doing what can we suffer more 
0	what can we suffer worse is this then worst 
0	thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms

0	by my advice since fate inevitable

0	our strength is equal nor the law unjust
0	that so ordains this was at first resolv d

0	not mind us not offending satisfi d

0	this horror will grow milde this darkness light 
0	besides what hope the never ending flight

0	worth waiting since our present lot appeers
0	for happy though but ill for ill not worst 
0	if we procure not to our selves more woe 
0	thus belial with words cloath d in reasons garb

0	of servile pomp our greatness will appear

0	secure and at the brightning orient beam
0	purge off this gloom the soft delicious air

0	by model or by shading pencil drawn 
0	the stairs were such as whereon jacob saw

0	direct against which op nd from beneath 
0	just o re the blissful seat of paradise 
0	a passage down to th earth a passage wide

0	by which to visit oft those happy tribes 
0	on high behests his angels to and fro
0	pass d frequent and his eye with choice regard

0	through dark and desart wayes with peril gone
0	all night at last by break of chearful dawne
0	obtains the brow of some high climbing hill 
0	which to his eye discovers unaware
0	the goodly prospect of some forein land

0	such wonder seis d though after heaven seen

0	of libra to the fleecie starr that bears
0	beyond th horizon then from pole to pole
0	he views in bredth and without longer pause
0	down right into the worlds first region throws

0	through the pure marble air his oblique way
0	amongst innumerable starrs that shon

0	or other worlds they seemd or happy iles

0	compar d with aught on earth medal or stone

0	breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run
0	potable gold when with one vertuous touch
0	th arch chimic sun so farr from us remote
0	produces with terrestrial humor mixt
0	here in the dark so many precious things
0	of colour glorious and effect so rare 
0	here matter new to gaze the devil met
0	undazl d farr and wide his eye commands 
0	for sight no obstacle found here nor shade

0	o sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams
0	that bring to my remembrance from what state
0	i fell how glorious once above thy spheare 
0	till pride and worse ambition threw me down
0	warring in heav n against heav ns matchless king 
0	ah wherefore he deservd no such return
0	from me whom he created what i was
0	in that bright eminence and with his good
0	upbraided none nor was his service hard 
0	what could be less then to afford him praise 
0	the easiest recompence and pay him thanks 
0	how due yet all his good prov d ill in me 
0	and wrought but malice lifted up so high
0	i sdeind subjection and thought one step higher
0	would set me highest and in a moment quit
0	the debt immense of endless gratitude 
0	so burthensome still paying still to ow 
0	forgetful what from him i still receivd 
0	and understood not that a grateful mind
0	by owing owes not but still pays at once
0	indebted and dischargd what burden then 
0	o had his powerful destiny ordaind
0	me some inferiour angel i had stood
0	then happie no unbounded hope had rais d
0	ambition yet why not som other power
0	as great might have aspir d and me though mean
0	drawn to his part but other powers as great
0	fell not but stand unshak n from within
0	or from without to all temptations arm d 
0	hadst thou the same free will and power to stand 
0	thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse 
0	but heav ns free love dealt equally to all 
0	be then his love accurst since love or hate 
0	to me alike it deals eternal woe 
0	nay curs d be thou since against his thy will
0	chose freely what it now so justly rues 
0	me miserable which way shall i flie
0	infinite wrauth and infinite despaire 
0	which way i flie is hell my self am hell 
0	and in the lowest deep a lower deep
0	still threatning to devour me opens wide 
0	to which the hell i suffer seems a heav n 
0	o then at last relent is there no place
0	left for repentance none for pardon left 
0	none left but by submission and that word
0	disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
0	among the spirits beneath whom i seduc d
0	with other promises and other vaunts
0	then to submit boasting i could subdue
0	th omnipotent ay me they little know
0	how dearly i abide that boast so vaine 
0	under what torments inwardly i groane 
0	while they adore me on the throne of hell 
0	with diadem and scepter high advanc d
0	the lower still i fall onely supream
0	in miserie such joy ambition findes 
0	but say i could repent and could obtaine
0	by act of grace my former state how soon
0	would highth recal high thoughts how soon unsay
0	what feign d submission swore ease would recant
0	vows made in pain as violent and void 
0	for never can true reconcilement grow
0	where wounds of deadly hate have peirc d so deep 
0	which would but lead me to a worse relapse
0	and heavier fall so should i purchase deare
0	short intermission bought with double smart 
0	this knows my punisher therefore as farr
0	from granting hee as i from begging peace 
0	all hope excluded thus behold in stead
0	of us out cast exil d his new delight 
0	mankind created and for him this world 
0	so farwel hope and with hope farwel fear 
0	farwel remorse all good to me is lost 
0	evil be thou my good by thee at least
0	divided empire with heav ns king i hold

0	thus while he spake each passion dimm d his face

0	insuperable highth of loftiest shade

0	a silvan scene and as the ranks ascend
0	shade above shade a woodie theatre
0	of stateliest view yet higher then thir tops
0	the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung 
0	which to our general sire gave prospect large
0	into his neather empire neighbouring round 
0	and higher then that wall a circling row
0	of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit 
0	blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue
0	appeerd with gay enameld colours mixt

0	then in fair evening cloud or humid bow

0	meets his approach and to the heart inspires
0	vernal delight and joy able to drive
0	all sadness but despair now gentle gales
0	fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense

0	due entrance he disdaind and in contempt 
0	at one slight bound high overleap d all bound
0	of hill or highest wall and sheer within

0	watching where shepherds pen thir flocks at eeve
0	in hurdl d cotes amid the field secure 
0	leaps o re the fence with ease into the fould

0	so clomb this first grand thief into gods fould 
0	so since into his church lewd hirelings climbe

0	the middle tree and highest there that grew 
0	sat like a cormorant yet not true life

0	a heaven on earth for blissful paradise
0	of god the garden was by him in the east
0	of eden planted eden stretchd her line

0	henceforth my dwelling haply may not please
0	like this fair paradise your sense yet such
0	accept your makers work he gave it me

0	the only sign of our obedience left
0	among so many signes of power and rule
0	conferrd upon us and dominion giv n

0	and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy
0	so farr the happier lot enjoying thee
0	preeminent by so much odds while thou
0	like consort to thy self canst no where find 
0	that day i oft remember when from sleep
0	i first awak t and found my self repos d
0	under a shade on flours much wondring where
0	and what i was whence thither brought and how 
0	not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
0	of waters issu d from a cave and spread
0	into a liquid plain then stood unmov d
0	pure as th expanse of heav n i thither went
0	with unexperienc t thought and laid me downe
0	on the green bank to look into the cleer
0	smooth lake that to me seemd another skie 
0	as i bent down to look just opposite 
0	a shape within the watry gleam appeerd
0	bending to look on me i started back 
0	it started back but pleasd i soon returnd 
0	pleas d it returnd as soon with answering looks
0	of sympathie and love there i had fixt
0	mine eyes till now and pin d with vain desire 
0	had not a voice thus warnd me what thou seest 
0	what there thou seest fair creature is thy self 
0	with thee it came and goes but follow me 
0	and i will bring thee where no shadow staies
0	thy coming and thy soft imbraces hee
0	whose image thou art him thou shall enjoy
0	inseparablie thine to him shalt beare
0	multitudes like thy self and thence be call d

0	but follow strait invisibly thus led 
0	till i espi d thee fair indeed and tall 
0	under a platan yet methought less faire 
0	less winning soft less amiablie milde 
0	then that smooth watry image back i turnd

0	my other half with that thy gentle hand
0	seisd mine i yeilded and from that time see
0	how beauty is excelld by manly grace
0	and wisdom which alone is truly fair 
0	so spake our general mother and with eyes
0	of conjugal attraction unreprov d 
0	and meek surrender half imbracing leand
0	on our first father half her swelling breast
0	naked met his under the flowing gold
0	of her loose tresses hid he in delight
0	both of her beauty and submissive charms
0	smil d with superior love as jupiter

0	from thir own mouths all is not theirs it seems 
0	one fatal tree there stands of knowledge call d 
0	forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidd n 
0	suspicious reasonless why should thir lord
0	envie them that can it be sin to know 
0	can it be death and do they onely stand
0	by ignorance is that thir happie state 
0	the proof of thir obedience and thir faith 
0	o fair foundation laid whereon to build
0	thir ruine hence i will excite thir minds
0	with more desire to know and to reject
0	envious commands invented with designe
0	to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
0	equal with gods aspiring to be such 
0	they taste and die what likelier can ensue 
0	but first with narrow search i must walk round
0	this garden and no corner leave unspi d 
0	a chance but chance may lead where i may meet
0	some wandring spirit of heav n by fountain side 
0	or in thick shade retir d from him to draw

0	short pleasures for long woes are to succeed 
0	so saying his proud step he scornful turn d

0	through wood through waste o re hil o re dale his roam 
0	mean while in utmost longitude where heav n
0	with earth and ocean meets the setting sun
0	slowly descended and with right aspect
0	against the eastern gate of paradise
0	leveld his eevning rayes it was a rock

0	half wheeling to the shield half to the spear

0	who tells of som infernal spirit seen
0	hitherward bent who could have thought escap d

0	such where ye find seise fast and hither bring 
0	so saying on he led his radiant files 
0	daz ling the moon these to the bower direct
0	in search of whom they sought him there they found
0	squat like a toad close at the eare of eve 
0	assaying by his devilish art to reach
0	the organs of her fancie and with them forge
0	illusions as he list phantasms and dreams 
0	or if inspiring venom he might taint

0	like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
0	at least distemperd discontented thoughts

0	blown up with high conceits ingendring pride 
0	him thus intent ithuriel with his spear
0	touch d lightly for no falshood can endure
0	touch of celestial temper but returns
0	of force to its own likeness up he starts

0	fit for the tun som magazin to store
0	against a rumord warr the smuttie graine
0	with sudden blaze diffus d inflames the aire 
0	so started up in his own shape the fiend

0	so sudden to behold the grieslie king 
0	yet thus unmovd with fear accost him soon 
0	which of those rebell spirits adjudg d to hell
0	com st thou escap d thy prison and transform d 
0	why satst thou like an enemie in waite
0	here watching at the head of these that sleep 
0	know ye not then said satan filld with scorn 
0	know ye not me ye knew me once no mate
0	for you there sitting where ye durst not soare 
0	not to know mee argues your selves unknown 
0	the lowest of your throng or if ye know

0	to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn 
0	think not revolted spirit thy shape the same 
0	or undiminisht brightness to be known
0	as when thou stoodst in heav n upright and pure 
0	that glorie then when thou no more wast good 
0	departed from thee and thou resembl st now
0	thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule 
0	but come for thou be sure shalt give account
0	to him who sent us whose charge is to keep
0	this place inviolable and these from harm 
0	so spake the cherube and his grave rebuke
0	severe in youthful beautie added grace
0	invincible abasht the devil stood 
0	and felt how awful goodness is and saw
0	vertue in her shape how lovly saw and pin d
0	his loss but chiefly to find here observd
0	his lustre visibly impar d yet seemd
0	undaunted if i must contend said he 
0	best with the best the sender not the sent 
0	or all at once more glorie will be wonn 
0	or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold 
0	will save us trial what the least can doe
0	single against thee wicked and thence weak 
0	the fiend repli d not overcome with rage 
0	but like a proud steed reind went hautie on 
0	chaumping his iron curb to strive or flie
0	he held it vain awe from above had quelld
0	his heart not else dismai d now drew they nigh
0	the western point where those half rounding guards
0	just met closing stood in squadron joind
0	awaiting next command to whom thir chief
0	gabriel from the front thus calld aloud 
0	o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet
0	hasting this way and now by glimps discerne
0	ithuriel and zephon through the shade 
0	and with them comes a third of regal port 
0	but faded splendor wan who by his gate
0	and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell 
0	not likely to part hence without contest 
0	stand firm for in his look defiance lours 
0	he scarce had ended when those two approachd
0	and brief related whom they brought wher found 
0	how busied in what form and posture coucht 
0	to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake 
0	why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescrib d
0	to thy transgressions and disturbd the charge
0	of others who approve not to transgress
0	by thy example but have power and right
0	to question thy bold entrance on this place 
0	imploi d it seems to violate sleep and those
0	whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss 
0	to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow 
0	gabriel thou hadst in heav n th esteem of wise 
0	and such i held thee but this question askt
0	puts me in doubt lives ther who loves his pain 
0	who would not finding way break loose from hell 
0	though thither doomd thou wouldst thy self no doubt 
0	and boldly venture to whatever place
0	farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
0	torment with ease soonest recompence
0	dole with delight which in this place i sought 
0	to thee no reason who knowst only good 
0	but evil hast not tri d and wilt object
0	his will who bound us let him surer barr
0	his iron gates if he intends our stay
0	in that dark durance thus much what was askt 
0	the rest is true they found me where they say 
0	but that implies not violence or harme 
0	thus hee in scorn the warlike angel mov d 
0	disdainfully half smiling thus repli d 
0	o loss of one in heav n to judge of wise 
0	since satan fell whom follie overthrew 
0	and now returns him from his prison scap t 
0	gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
0	or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
0	unlicenc t from his bounds in hell prescrib d 
0	so wise he judges it to fly from pain
0	however and to scape his punishment 
0	so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrauth 
0	which thou incurr st by flying meet thy flight
0	seavenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell 
0	which taught thee yet no better that no pain
0	can equal anger infinite provok t 
0	but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee
0	came not all hell broke loose is pain to them
0	less pain less to be fled or thou then they
0	less hardie to endure courageous chief 
0	the first in flight from pain had st thou alleg d
0	to thy deserted host this cause of flight 
0	thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive 
0	to which the fiend thus answerd frowning stern 
0	not that i less endure or shrink from pain 
0	insulting angel well thou knowst i stood
0	thy fiercest when in battel to thy aide
0	the blasting volied thunder made all speed
0	and seconded thy else not dreaded spear 
0	but still thy words at random as before 
0	argue thy inexperience what behooves
0	from hard assaies and ill successes past
0	a faithful leader not to hazard all
0	through wayes of danger by himself untri d 
0	i therefore i alone first undertook
0	to wing the desolate abyss and spie
0	this new created world whereof in hell
0	fame is not silent here in hope to find
0	better abode and my afflicted powers
0	to settle here on earth or in mid aire 
0	though for possession put to try once more
0	what thou and thy gay legions dare against 
0	whose easier business were to serve thir lord
0	high up in heav n with songs to hymne his throne 
0	and practis d distances to cringe not fight 
0	to whom the warriour angel soon repli d 
0	to say and strait unsay pretending first
0	wise to flie pain professing next the spie 
0	argues no leader but a lyar trac t 
0	satan and couldst thou faithful add o name 
0	o sacred name of faithfulness profan d 
0	faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew 
0	armie of fiends fit body to fit head 
0	was this your discipline and faith ingag d 
0	your military obedience to dissolve
0	allegeance to th acknowledg d power supream 
0	and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
0	patron of liberty who more then thou
0	once fawn d and cring d and servilly ador d
0	heav ns awful monarch wherefore but in hope
0	to dispossess him and thy self to reigne 
0	but mark what i arreede thee now avant 
0	flie thither whence thou fledst if from this houre
0	within these hallowd limits thou appeer 
0	back to th infernal pit i drag thee chaind 
0	and seale thee so as henceforth not to scorne
0	the facil gates of hell too slightly barrd 
0	so threatn d hee but satan to no threats
0	gave heed but waxing more in rage repli d 
0	then when i am thy captive talk of chaines 
0	proud limitarie cherube but ere then
0	farr heavier load thy self expect to feel
0	from my prevailing arme though heavens king
0	ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers

0	in progress through the rode of heav n star pav d 
0	while thus he spake th angelic squadron bright
0	turnd fierie red sharpning in mooned hornes
0	thir phalanx and began to hemm him round
0	with ported spears as thick as when a field
0	of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
0	her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
0	swayes them the careful plowman doubting stands
0	least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves
0	prove chaff on th other side satan allarm d
0	collecting all his might dilated stood 
0	like teneriff or atlas unremov d 
0	his stature reacht the skie and on his crest
0	sat horror plum d nor wanted in his graspe
0	what seemd both spear and shield now dreadful deeds
0	might have ensu d nor onely paradise
0	in this commotion but the starrie cope
0	of heav n perhaps or all the elements
0	at least had gon to rack disturbd and torne
0	with violence of this conflict had not soon
0	th eternal to prevent such horrid fray
0	hung forth in heav n his golden scales yet seen
0	betwixt astrea and the scorpion signe 
0	wherein all things created first he weighd 
0	the pendulous round earth with ballanc t aire
0	in counterpoise now ponders all events 
0	battels and realms in these he put two weights
0	the sequel each of parting and of fight 
0	the latter quick up flew and kickt the beam 
0	which gabriel spying thus bespake the fiend 
0	satan i know thy strength and thou knowst mine 
0	neither our own but giv n what follie then
0	to boast what arms can doe since thine no more
0	then heav n permits nor mine though doubld now
0	to trample thee as mire for proof look up 
0	and read thy lot in yon celestial sign
0	where thou art weigh d shown how light how weak 
0	if thou resist the fiend lookt up and knew
0	his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled
0	murmuring and with him fled the shades of night 
0	now morn her rosie steps in th eastern clime
0	advancing sow d the earth with orient pearle 
0	when adam wak t so customd for his sleep
0	was aerie light from pure digestion bred 
0	and temperat vapors bland which th only sound
0	of leaves and fuming rills aurora s fan 
0	lightly dispers d and the shrill matin song
0	of birds on every bough so much the more
0	his wonder was to find unwak nd eve
0	with tresses discompos d and glowing cheek 
0	as through unquiet rest he on his side
0	leaning half rais d with looks of cordial love
0	hung over her enamour d and beheld
0	beautie which whether waking or asleep 
0	shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
0	milde as when zephyrus on flora breathes 
0	her hand soft touching whisperd thus awake
0	my fairest my espous d my latest found 
0	heav ns last best gift my ever new delight 
0	awake the morning shines and the fresh field
0	calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
0	our tended plants how blows the citron grove 
0	what drops the myrrhe what the balmie reed 
0	how nature paints her colours how the bee
0	sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet 
0	such whispering wak d her but with startl d eye
0	on adam whom imbracing thus she spake 
0	o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose 
0	my glorie my perfection glad i see
0	thy face and morn return d for i this night 
0	such night till this i never pass d have dream d 
0	if dream d not as i oft am wont of thee 
0	works of day pass t or morrows next designe 
0	but of offence and trouble which my mind
0	knew never till this irksom night methought
0	close at mine ear one call d me forth to walk
0	with gentle voice i thought it thine it said 
0	why sleepst thou eve now is the pleasant time 
0	the cool the silent save where silence yields
0	to the night warbling bird that now awake
0	tunes sweetest his love labor d song now reignes
0	full orb d the moon and with more pleasing light
0	shadowie sets off the face of things in vain 
0	if none regard heav n wakes with all his eyes 
0	whom to behold but thee natures desire 
0	in whose sight all things joy with ravishment
0	attracted by thy beauty still to gaze 
0	i rose as at thy call but found thee not 
0	to find thee i directed then my walk 
0	and on methought alone i pass d through ways
0	that brought me on a sudden to the tree
0	of interdicted knowledge fair it seem d 
0	much fairer to my fancie then by day 
0	and as i wondring lookt beside it stood
0	one shap d wing d like one of those from heav n
0	by us oft seen his dewie locks distill d
0	ambrosia on that tree he also gaz d 
0	and o fair plant said he with fruit surcharg d 
0	deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet 
0	nor god nor man is knowledge so despis d 
0	or envie or what reserve forbids to taste 
0	forbid who will none shall from me withhold
0	longer thy offerd good why else set here 
0	this said he paus d not but with ventrous arme
0	he pluckt he tasted mee damp horror chil d
0	at such bold words voucht with a deed so bold 
0	but he thus overjoy d o fruit divine 
0	sweet of thy self but much more sweet thus cropt 
0	forbidd n here it seems as onely fit
0	for gods yet able to make gods of men 
0	and why not gods of men since good the more
0	communicated more abundant growes 
0	the author not impair d but honourd more 
0	here happie creature fair angelic eve 
0	partake thou also happie though thou art 
0	happier thou mayst be worthier canst not be 
0	taste this and be henceforth among the gods
0	thy self a goddess not to earth confind 
0	but somtimes in the air as wee somtimes
0	ascend to heav n by merit thine and see
0	what life the gods live there and such live thou 
0	so saying he drew nigh and to me held 
0	even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
0	which he had pluckt the pleasant savourie smell
0	so quick nd appetite that i methought 
0	could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds
0	with him i flew and underneath beheld
0	the earth outstretcht immense a prospect wide
0	and various wondring at my flight and change
0	to this high exaltation suddenly
0	my guide was gon and i me thought sunk down 
0	and fell asleep but o how glad i wak d
0	to find this but a dream thus eve her night
0	related and thus adam answerd sad 
0	best image of my self and dearer half 
0	the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
0	affects me equally nor can i like
0	this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear 
0	yet evil whence in thee can harbour none 
0	created pure but know that in the soule
0	are many lesser faculties that serve
0	reason as chief among these fansie next
0	her office holds of all external things 
0	which the five watchful senses represent 
0	she forms imaginations aerie shapes 
0	which reason joyning or disjoyning frames
0	all what we affirm or what deny and call
0	our knowledge or opinion then retires
0	into her private cell when nature rests 
0	oft in her absence mimic fansie wakes
0	to imitate her but misjoyning shapes 
0	wilde work produces oft and most in dreams 
0	ill matching words and deeds long past or late 
0	som such resemblances methinks i find
0	of our last eevnings talk in this thy dream 
0	but with addition strange yet be not sad 
0	evil into the mind of god or man
0	may come and go so unapprov d and leave
0	no spot or blame behind which gives me hope
0	that what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream 
0	waking thou never wilt consent to do 
0	be not disheart nd then nor cloud those looks
0	that wont to be more chearful and serene
0	then when fair morning first smiles on the world 
0	and let us to our fresh imployments rise
0	that open now thir choicest bosom d smells
0	reservd from night and kept for thee in store 
0	so cheard he his fair spouse and she was cheard 
0	but silently a gentle tear let fall
0	from either eye and wip d them with her haire 
0	two other precious drops that ready stood 
0	each in thir chrystal sluce hee ere they fell
0	kiss d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
0	and pious awe that feard to have offended 
0	so all was cleard and to the field they haste 
0	but first from under shadie arborous roof 
0	soon as they forth were come to open sight
0	of day spring and the sun who scarce up risen
0	with wheels yet hov ring o re the ocean brim 
0	shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray 
0	discovering in wide lantskip all the east
0	of paradise and edens happie plains 
0	lowly they bow d adoring and began
0	thir orisons each morning duly paid
0	in various style for neither various style
0	nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
0	thir maker in fit strains pronounc t or sung
0	unmeditated such prompt eloquence
0	flowd from thir lips in prose or numerous verse 
0	more tuneable then needed lute or harp
0	to add more sweetness and they thus began 
0	these are thy glorious works parent of good 
0	almightie thine this universal frame 
0	thus wondrous fair thy self how wondrous then 
0	unspeakable who sitst above these heavens
0	to us invisible or dimly seen

0	so oft in festivals of joy and love
0	unanimous as sons of one great sire
0	hymning th eternal father but the shout

0	should yet remain where faith and realtie
0	remain not wherfore should not strength might
0	there fail where vertue fails or weakest prove
0	where boldest though to sight unconquerable

0	victor though brutish that contest and foule 
0	when reason hath to deal with force yet so
0	most reason is that reason overcome 
0	so pondering and from his armed peers

0	proud art thou met thy hope was to have reacht

0	god hath assign d us nor of me shalt pass
0	unprais d for nothing lovelier can be found
0	in woman then to studie houshold good

0	watches no doubt with greedy hope to find

0	hopeless to circumvent us joynd where each
0	to other speedie aide might lend at need 
0	whether his first design be to withdraw

0	conjugal love then which perhaps no bliss
0	enjoy d by us excites his envie more 
0	or this or worse leave not the faithful side
0	that gave thee being stil shades thee and protects

0	ofspring of heav n and earth and all earths lord 
0	that such an enemie we have who seeks
0	our ruin both by thee informd i learne 
0	and from the parting angel over heard
0	as in a shadie nook i stood behind 
0	just then returnd at shut of evening flours 
0	but that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
0	to god or thee because we have a foe
0	may tempt it i expected not to hear 
0	his violence thou fearst not being such 
0	as wee not capable of death or paine 
0	can either not receave or can repell 
0	his fraud is then thy fear which plain inferrs
0	thy equal fear that my firm faith and love
0	can by his fraud be shak n or seduc t 
0	thoughts which how found they harbour in thy brest 
0	adam misthought of her to thee so dear 
0	to whom with healing words adam reply d 
0	daughter of god and man immortal eve 
0	for such thou art from sin and blame entire 
0	not diffident of thee do i dissuade
0	thy absence from my sight but to avoid
0	th attempt it self intended by our foe 
0	for hee who tempts though in vain at least asperses
0	the tempted with dishonour foul suppos d
0	not incorruptible of faith not prooff
0	against temptation thou thy self with scorne
0	and anger wouldst resent the offer d wrong 
0	though ineffectual found misdeem not then 
0	if such affront i labour to avert
0	from thee alone which on us both at once
0	the enemie though bold will hardly dare 
0	or daring first on mee th assault shall light 
0	nor thou his malice and false guile contemn 
0	suttle he needs must be who could seduce
0	angels nor think superfluous others aid 
0	i from the influence of thy looks receave
0	access in every vertue in thy sight
0	more wise more watchful stronger if need were
0	of outward strength while shame thou looking on 
0	shame to be overcome or over reacht
0	would utmost vigor raise and rais d unite 
0	why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
0	when i am present and thy trial choose
0	with me best witness of thy vertue tri d 
0	so spake domestick adam in his care
0	and matrimonial love but eve who thought
0	less attributed to her faith sincere 
0	thus her reply with accent sweet renewd 
0	if this be our condition thus to dwell
0	in narrow circuit strait nd by a foe 
0	suttle or violent we not endu d
0	single with like defence wherever met 
0	how are we happie still in fear of harm 
0	but harm precedes not sin onely our foe
0	tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
0	of our integritie his foul esteeme
0	sticks no dishonor on our front but turns
0	foul on himself then wherfore shund or feard
0	by us who rather double honour gaine
0	from his surmise prov d false finde peace within 
0	favour from heav n our witness from th event 
0	and what is faith love vertue unassaid
0	alone without exterior help sustaind 
0	let us not then suspect our happie state
0	left so imperfet by the maker wise 
0	as not secure to single or combin d 
0	fraile is our happiness if this be so 
0	and eden were no eden thus expos d 
0	to whom thus adam fervently repli d 
0	o woman best are all things as the will
0	of god ordaind them his creating hand
0	nothing imperfet or deficient left
0	of all that he created much less man 
0	or ought that might his happie state secure 
0	secure from outward force within himself
0	the danger lies yet lies within his power 
0	against his will he can receave no harme 
0	but god left free the will for what obeyes
0	reason is free and reason he made right 
0	but bid her well beware and still erect 
0	least by some faire appeering good surpris d
0	she dictate false and missinforme the will
0	to do what god expresly hath forbid 
0	not then mistrust but tender love enjoynes 
0	that i should mind thee oft and mind thou me 
0	firm we subsist yet possible to swerve 
0	since reason not impossibly may meet
0	some specious object by the foe subornd 
0	and fall into deception unaware 
0	not keeping strictest watch as she was warnd 
0	seek not temptation then which to avoide
0	were better and most likelie if from mee
0	thou sever not trial will come unsought 
0	wouldst thou approve thy constancie approve
0	first thy obedience th other who can know 
0	not seeing thee attempted who attest 
0	but if thou think trial unsought may finde
0	us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst 
0	go for thy stay not free absents thee more 
0	go in thy native innocence relie
0	on what thou hast of vertue summon all 
0	for god towards thee hath done his part do thine 
0	so spake the patriarch of mankinde but eve
0	persisted yet submiss though last repli d 
0	with thy permission then and thus forewarnd
0	chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
0	touchd onely that our trial when least sought 
0	may finde us both perhaps farr less prepar d 
0	the willinger i goe nor much expect
0	a foe so proud will first the weaker seek 
0	so bent the more shall shame him his repulse 
0	thus saying from her husbands hand her hand

0	within me cleere not onely to discerne
0	things in thir causes but to trace the wayes
0	of highest agents deemd however wise 
0	queen of this universe doe not believe
0	those rigid threats of death ye shall not die 
0	how should ye by the fruit it gives you life
0	to knowledge by the threatner look on mee 
0	mee who have touch d and tasted yet both live 
0	and life more perfet have attaind then fate
0	meant mee by ventring higher then my lot 
0	shall that be shut to man which to the beast
0	is open or will god incense his ire
0	for such a pretty trespass and not praise
0	rather your dauntless vertue whom the pain
0	of death denounc t whatever thing death be 
0	deterrd not from atchieving what might leade
0	to happier life knowledge of good and evil 
0	of good how just of evil if what is evil
0	be real why not known since easier shunnd 
0	god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just 
0	not just not god not feard then nor obeid 
0	your feare it self of death removes the feare 
0	why then was this forbid why but to awe 
0	why but to keep ye low and ignorant 
0	his worshippers he knows that in the day
0	ye eate thereof your eyes that seem so cleere 
0	yet are but dim shall perfetly be then
0	op nd and cleerd and ye shall be as gods 
0	knowing both good and evil as they know 
0	that ye should be as gods since i as man 
0	internal man is but proportion meet 
0	i of brute human yee of human gods 
0	so ye shalt die perhaps by putting off
0	human to put on gods death to be wisht 
0	though threat nd which no worse then this can bring
0	and what are gods that man may not become
0	as they participating god like food 
0	the gods are first and that advantage use
0	on our belief that all from them proceeds 
0	i question it for this fair earth i see 
0	warm d by the sun producing every kind 
0	them nothing if they all things who enclos d
0	knowledge of good and evil in this tree 
0	that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
0	wisdom without their leave and wherein lies
0	th offence that man should thus attain to know 
0	what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
0	impart against his will if all be his 
0	or is it envie and can envie dwell
0	in heav nly brests these these and many more
0	causes import your need of this fair fruit 
0	goddess humane reach then and freely taste 
0	he ended and his words replete with guile
0	into her heart too easie entrance won 
0	fixt on the fruit she gaz d which to behold
0	might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
0	yet rung of his perswasive words impregn d
0	with reason to her seeming and with truth 
0	meanwhile the hour of noon drew on and wak d
0	an eager appetite rais d by the smell
0	so savorie of that fruit which with desire 
0	inclinable now grown to touch or taste 
0	sollicited her longing eye yet first
0	pausing a while thus to her self she mus d 
0	great are thy vertues doubtless best of fruits 
0	though kept from man worthy to be admir d 
0	whose taste too long forborn at first assay
0	gave elocution to the mute and taught
0	the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise 
0	thy praise hee also who forbids thy use 
0	conceales not from us naming thee the tree
0	of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil 
0	forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
0	commends thee more while it inferrs the good
0	by thee communicated and our want 
0	for good unknown sure is not had or had
0	and yet unknown is as not had at all 
0	in plain then what forbids he but to know 
0	forbids us good forbids us to be wise 
0	such prohibitions binde not but if death
0	bind us with after bands what profits then
0	our inward freedom in the day we eate
0	of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die 
0	how dies the serpent hee hath eat n and lives 
0	and knows and speaks and reasons and discernes 
0	irrational till then for us alone
0	was death invented or to us deni d
0	this intellectual food for beasts reserv d 
0	for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
0	hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
0	the good befall n him author unsuspect 
0	friendly to man farr from deceit or guile 
0	what fear i then rather what know to feare
0	under this ignorance of good and evil 
0	here grows the cure of all this fruit divine 
0	fair to the eye inviting to the taste 
0	of vertue to make wise what hinders then
0	to reach and feed at once both bodie and mind 
0	so saying her rash hand in evil hour
0	forth reaching to the fruit she pluck d she eat 
0	earth felt the wound and nature from her seat
0	sighing through all her works gave signs of woe 
0	that all was lost back to the thicket slunk
0	the guiltie serpent and well might for eve
0	intent now wholly on her taste naught else
0	regarded such delight till then as seemd 
0	in fruit she never tasted whether true
0	or fansied so through expectation high
0	of knowledg nor was god head from her thought 
0	greedily she ingorg d without restraint 
0	and knew not eating death satiate at length 
0	and hight nd as with wine jocond and boon 
0	thus to her self she pleasingly began 
0	o sovran vertuous precious of all trees
0	in paradise of operation blest
0	to sapience hitherto obscur d infam d 
0	and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
0	created but henceforth my early care 
0	not without song each morning and due praise
0	shall tend thee and the fertil burden ease
0	of thy full branches offer d free to all 
0	till dieted by thee i grow mature
0	in knowledge as the gods who all things know 
0	though others envie what they cannot give 
0	for had the gift bin theirs it had not here
0	thus grown experience next to thee i owe 
0	best guide not following thee i had remaind
0	in ignorance thou op nst wisdoms way 
0	and giv st access though secret she retire 
0	and i perhaps am secret heav n is high 
0	high and remote to see from thence distinct
0	each thing on earth and other care perhaps
0	may have diverted from continual watch
0	our great forbidder safe with all his spies
0	about him but to adam in what sort
0	shall i appeer shall i to him make known
0	as yet my change and give him to partake
0	full happiness with mee or rather not 
0	but keep the odds of knowledge in my power
0	without copartner so to add what wants
0	in femal sex the more to draw his love 
0	and render me more equal and perhaps
0	a thing not undesireable somtime
0	superior for inferior who is free 
0	this may be well but what if god have seen 
0	and death ensue then i shall be no more 
0	and adam wedded to another eve 
0	shall live with her enjoying i extinct 
0	a death to think confirm d then i resolve 
0	adam shall share with me in bliss or woe 
0	so dear i love him that with him all deaths
0	i could endure without him live no life 
0	so saying from the tree her step she turnd 
0	but first low reverence don as to the power
0	that dwelt within whose presence had infus d
0	into the plant sciential sap deriv d
0	from nectar drink of gods adam the while
0	waiting desirous her return had wove
0	of choicest flours a garland to adorne
0	her tresses and her rural labours crown
0	as reapers oft are wont thir harvest queen 
0	great joy he promis d to his thoughts and new
0	solace in her return so long delay d 
0	yet oft his heart divine of somthing ill 
0	misgave him hee the faultring measure felt 
0	and forth to meet her went the way she took
0	that morn when first they parted by the tree
0	of knowledge he must pass there he her met 
0	scarse from the tree returning in her hand
0	a bough of fairest fruit that downie smil d 
0	new gatherd and ambrosial smell diffus d 
0	to him she hasted in her face excuse
0	came prologue and apologie to prompt 
0	which with bland words at will she thus addrest 
0	hast thou not wonderd adam at my stay 
0	thee i have misst and thought it long depriv d
0	thy presence agonie of love till now
0	not felt nor shall be twice for never more
0	mean i to trie what rash untri d i sought 
0	the paine of absence from thy sight but strange
0	hath bin the cause and wonderful to heare 
0	this tree is not as we are told a tree
0	of danger tasted nor to evil unknown
0	op ning the way but of divine effect
0	to open eyes and make them gods who taste 
0	and hath bin tasted such the serpent wise 
0	or not restraind as wee or not obeying 
0	hath eat n of the fruit and is become 
0	not dead as we are threatn d but thenceforth
0	endu d with human voice and human sense 
0	reasoning to admiration and with mee
0	perswasively hath so prevaild that i
0	have also tasted and have also found
0	th effects to correspond opener mine eyes 
0	dimm erst dilated spirits ampler heart 
0	and growing up to godhead which for thee
0	chiefly i sought without thee can despise 
0	for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss 
0	tedious unshar d with thee and odious soon 
0	thou therefore also taste that equal lot
0	may joyne us equal joy as equal love 
0	least thou not tasting different degree
0	disjoyne us and i then too late renounce
0	deitie for thee when fate will not permit 
0	thus eve with countnance blithe her storie told 
0	but in her cheek distemper flushing glowd 
0	on th other side adam soon as he heard
0	the fatal trespass don by eve amaz d 
0	astonied stood and blank while horror chill
0	ran through his veins and all his joynts relax d 
0	from his slack hand the garland wreath d for eve
0	down drop d and all the faded roses shed 
0	speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
0	first to himself he inward silence broke 
0	o fairest of creation last and best
0	of all gods works creature in whom excell d
0	whatever can to fight or thought be found 
0	holy divine good amiable or sweet 
0	how art thou lost how on a sudden lost 
0	defac t deflourd and now to death devote 
0	rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress
0	the strict forbiddance how to violate
0	the sacred fruit forbidd n som cursed fraud
0	of enemie hath beguil d thee yet unknown 
0	and mee with thee hath ruind for with thee
0	certain my resolution is to die 
0	how can i live without thee how forgoe
0	thy sweet converse and love so dearly joyn d 
0	to live again in these wilde woods forlorn 
0	should god create another eve and i

0	would never from my heart no no i feel

0	bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
0	mine never shall be parted bliss or woe 
0	so having said as one from sad dismay
0	recomforted and after thoughts disturbd
0	submitting to what seemd remediless 
0	thus in calme mood his words to eve he turnd 
0	bold deed thou hast presum d adventrous eve 
0	and peril great provok t who thus hast dar d
0	had it bin onely coveting to eye
0	that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence 
0	much more to taste it under banne to touch 
0	but past who can recall or don undoe 
0	not god omnipotent for fate yet so
0	perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
0	is not so hainous now foretasted fruit 
0	profan d first by the serpent by him first
0	made common and unhallowd ere one tastes 
0	nor yet on him found deadly he yet lives 
0	lives as thou saidst and gaines to live as man
0	higher degree of life inducement strong
0	to us as likely tasting to attaine
0	proportional ascent which cannot be
0	but to be gods or angels demi gods 
0	nor can i think that god creator wise 
0	though threatning will in earnest so destroy
0	us his prime creatures dignifi d so high 
0	set over all his works which in our fall

0	eve now i see thou art exact of taste

0	for this one tree had bin forbidden ten 
0	but come so well refresh t now let us play 
0	as meet is after such delicious fare 
0	for never did thy beautie since the day
0	i saw thee first and wedded thee adorn d
0	with all perfections so enflame my sense
0	with ardor to enjoy thee fairer now
0	then ever bountie of this vertuous tree 
0	so said he and forbore not glance or toy
0	of amorous intent well understood
0	of eve whose eye darted contagious fire 
0	her hand he seis d and to a shadie bank 
0	thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr d
0	he led her nothing loath flours were the couch 
0	and hyacinth earths freshest softest lap 
0	there they thir fill of love and loves disport
0	took largely of thir mutual guilt the seale 
0	the solace of thir sin till dewie sleep
0	oppress d them wearied with thir amorous play 
0	soon as the force of that fallacious fruit 
0	that with exhilerating vapour bland
0	about thir spirits had plaid and inmost powers
0	made erre was now exhal d and grosser sleep
0	bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
0	encumberd now had left them up they rose
0	as from unrest and each the other viewing 
0	soon found thir eyes how op nd and thir minds
0	how dark nd innocence that as a veile
0	had shadow d them from knowing ill was gon 
0	just confidence and native righteousness 
0	and honour from about them naked left
0	to guiltie shame hee cover d but his robe
0	uncover d more so rose the danite strong
0	herculean samson from the harlot lap
0	shorn of his strength they destitute and bare
0	of all thir vertue silent and in face
0	confounded long they sate as struck n mute 
0	till adam though not less then eve abasht 
0	at length gave utterance to these words constraind 
0	o eve in evil hour thou didst give care
0	to that false worm of whomsoever taught
0	to counterfet mans voice true in our fall 
0	false in our promis d rising since our eyes
0	op nd we find indeed and find we know
0	both good and evil good lost and evil got 
0	bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know 
0	which leaves us naked thus of honour void 
0	our wonted ornaments now soild and staind 
0	and in our faces evident the signes
0	of foul concupiscence whence evil store 
0	even shame the last of evils of the first
0	be sure then how shall i behold the face
0	henceforth of god or angel earst with joy
0	and rapture so oft beheld those heav nly shapes
0	will dazle now this earthly with thir blaze
0	insufferably bright o might i here
0	in solitude live savage in some glad
0	obscur d where highest woods impenetrable
0	to starr or sun light spread thir umbrage broad 
0	and brown as evening cover me ye pines 
0	ye cedars with innumerable boughs
0	hide me where i may never see them more 
0	but let us now as in bad plight devise
0	what best may for the present serve to hide
0	the parts of each from other that seem most
0	to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen 
0	some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sowd 
0	and girded on our loyns may cover round
0	those middle parts that this new commer shame 
0	there sit not and reproach us as unclean 
0	so counsel d hee and both together went
0	into the thickest wood there soon they chose
0	the figtree not that kind for fruit renown d 
0	but such as at this day to indians known
0	in malabar or decan spreds her armes
0	braunching so broad and long that in the ground
0	the bended twigs take root and daughters grow
0	about the mother tree a pillard shade
0	high overarch t and echoing walks between 
0	there oft the indian herdsman shunning heate
0	shelters in coole and tends his pasturing herds
0	at loopholes cut through thickest shade those leaves
0	they gatherd broad as amazonian targe 
0	and with what skill they had together sowd

0	accompanied to heaven gate from whence
0	eden and all the coast in prospect lay 
0	down he descended strait the speed of gods
0	time counts not though with swiftest minutes wing d 
0	now was the sun in western cadence low
0	from noon and gentle aires due at thir hour
0	to fan the earth now wak d and usher in
0	the eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole
0	came the mild judge and intercessor both
0	to sentence man the voice of god they heard
0	now walking in the garden by soft windes
0	brought to thir ears while day declin d they heard
0	and from his presence hid themselves among

0	he came and with him eve more loth though first
0	to offend discount nanc t both and discompos d 
0	love was not in thir looks either to god
0	or to each other but apparent guilt 
0	and shame and perturbation and despaire 
0	anger and obstinacie and hate and guile 
0	whence adam faultring long thus answer d brief 
0	i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
0	affraid being naked hid my self to whom
0	the gracious judge without revile repli d 
0	my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not fear d 
0	but still rejoyc t how is it now become
0	so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who
0	hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree
0	whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat 
0	to whom thus adam sore beset repli d 
0	o heav n in evil strait this day i stand
0	before my judge either to undergoe
0	my self the total crime or to accuse
0	my other self the partner of my life 
0	whose failing while her faith to me remaines 
0	i should conceal and not expose to blame
0	by my complaint but strict necessitie
0	subdues me and calamitous constraint 
0	least on my head both sin and punishment 
0	however insupportable be all
0	devolv d though should i hold my peace yet thou
0	wouldst easily detect what i conceale 
0	this woman whom thou mad st to be my help 
0	and gav st me as thy perfet gift so good 
0	so fit so acceptable so divine 
0	that from her hand i could suspect no ill 
0	and what she did whatever in it self 
0	her doing seem d to justifie the deed 
0	shee gave me of the tree and i did eate 
0	to whom the sovran presence thus repli d 
0	was shee thy god that her thou didst obey
0	before his voice or was shee made thy guide 
0	superior or but equal that to her
0	thou did st resigne thy manhood and the place
0	wherein god set thee above her made of thee 
0	and for thee whose perfection farr excell d
0	hers in all real dignitie adornd
0	she was indeed and lovely to attract
0	were such as under government well seem d 
0	unseemly to beare rule which was thy part
0	and person had st thou known thy self aright 
0	so having said he thus to eve in few 
0	say woman what is this which thou hast done 
0	to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm d 
0	confessing soon yet not before her judge
0	bold or loquacious thus abasht repli d 
0	the serpent me beguil d and i did eate 
0	which when the lord god heard without delay
0	to judgement he proceeded on th accus d
0	serpent though brute unable to transferre
0	the guilt on him who made him instrument
0	of mischief and polluted from the end
0	of his creation justly then accurst 
0	as vitiated in nature more to know
0	concern d not man since he no further knew 
0	nor alter d his offence yet god at last
0	to satan first in sin his doom apply d 
0	though in mysterious terms judg d as then best 
0	and on the serpent thus his curse let fall 
0	because thou hast done this thou art accurst
0	above all cattel each beast of the field 
0	upon thy belly groveling thou shalt goe 
0	and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life 
0	between thee and the woman i will put
0	enmitie and between thine and her seed 
0	her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel 
0	so spake this oracle then verifi d
0	when jesus son of mary second eve 
0	saw satan fall like lightning down from heav n 
0	prince of the aire then rising from his grave
0	spoild principalities and powers triumpht
0	in open shew and with ascention bright
0	captivity led captive through the aire 
0	the realme it self of satan long usurpt 
0	whom he shall tread at last under our feet 
0	eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise 
0	and to the woman thus his sentence turn d 
0	thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie
0	by thy conception children thou shalt bring
0	in sorrow forth and to thy husbands will
0	thine shall submit hee over thee shall rule 
0	on adam last thus judgement he pronounc d 
0	because thou hast heark nd to the voice of thy wife 
0	and eaten of the tree concerning which
0	i charg d thee saying thou shalt not eate thereof 
0	curs d is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
0	shalt eate thereof all the days of thy life 
0	thornes also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
0	unbid and thou shalt eate th herb of th field 
0	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread 
0	till thou return unto the ground for thou
0	out of the ground wast taken know thy birth 
0	for dust thou art and shalt to dust returne 
0	so judg d he man both judge and saviour sent 
0	and th instant stroke of death denounc t that day
0	remov d farr off then pittying how they stood
0	before him naked to the aire that now
0	must suffer change disdain d not to begin
0	thenceforth the forme of servant to assume 
0	as when he wash d his servants feet so now
0	as father of his familie he clad
0	thir nakedness with skins of beasts or slain 
0	or as the snake with youthful coate repaid 
0	and thought not much to cloath his enemies 
0	nor hee thir outward onely with the skins
0	of beasts but inward nakedness much more
0	opprobrious with his robe of righteousness 
0	araying cover d from his fathers sight 
0	to him with swift ascent he up returnd 
0	into his blissful bosom reassum d
0	in glory as of old to him appeas d
0	all though all knowing what had past with man
0	recounted mixing intercession sweet 
0	meanwhile ere thus was sin d and judg d on earth 
0	within the gates of hell sate sin and death 
0	in counterview within the gates that now
0	stood open wide belching outrageous flame
0	farr into chaos since the fiend pass d through 
0	sin opening who thus now to death began 
0	o son why sit we here each other viewing
0	idlely while satan our great author thrives
0	in other worlds and happier seat provides
0	for us his ofspring deare it cannot be
0	but that success attends him if mishap 
0	ere this he had return d with fury driv n
0	by his avenger since no place like this
0	can fit his punishment or their revenge 
0	methinks i feel new strength within me rise

0	powerful at greatest distance to unite

0	by secretest conveyance thou my shade
0	inseparable must with mee along 
0	for death from sin no power can separate 
0	but least the difficultie of passing back
0	stay his returne perhaps over this gulfe
0	impassable impervious let us try
0	adventrous work yet to thy power and mine
0	not unagreeable to found a path
0	over this maine from hell to that new world
0	where satan now prevailes a monument
0	of merit high to all th infernal host 
0	easing thir passage hence for intercourse

0	nor can i miss the way so strongly drawn

0	so saying with delight he snuff d the smell
0	of mortal change on earth as when a flock

0	heavie though in thir place o fleeting joyes
0	of paradise deare bought with lasting woes 
0	did i request thee maker from my clay
0	to mould me man did i sollicite thee
0	from darkness to promote me or here place
0	in this delicious garden as my will
0	concurd not to my being it were but right
0	and equal to reduce me to my dust 
0	desirous to resigne and render back
0	all i receav d unable to performe
0	thy terms too hard by which i was to hold
0	the good i sought not to the loss of that 
0	sufficient penaltie why hast thou added
0	the sense of endless woes inexplicable
0	thy justice seems yet to say truth too late 
0	i thus contest then should have been refusd
0	those terms whatever when they were propos d 
0	thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good 
0	then cavil the conditions and though god
0	made thee without thy leave what if thy son
0	prove disobedient and reprov d retort 
0	wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not 
0	wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
0	that proud excuse yet him not thy election 
0	but natural necessity begot 
0	god made thee of choice his own and of his own
0	to serve him thy reward was of his grace 
0	thy punishment then justly is at his will 
0	be it so for i submit his doom is fair 
0	that dust i am and shall to dust returne 
0	o welcom hour whenever why delayes
0	his hand to execute what his decree
0	fixd on this day why do i overlive 
0	why am i mockt with death and length nd out
0	to deathless pain how gladly would i meet
0	mortalitie my sentence and be earth
0	insensible how glad would lay me down
0	as in my mothers lap there i should rest
0	and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
0	would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
0	to mee and to my ofspring would torment me
0	with cruel expectation yet one doubt
0	pursues me still least all i cannot die 
0	least that pure breath of life the spirit of man
0	which god inspir d cannot together perish
0	with this corporeal clod then in the grave 
0	or in some other dismal place who knows
0	but i shall die a living death o thought
0	horrid if true yet why it was but breath
0	of life that sinn d what dies but what had life
0	and sin the bodie properly hath neither 
0	all of me then shall die let this appease
0	the doubt since humane reach no further knows 
0	for though the lord of all be infinite 
0	is his wrauth also be it man is not so 
0	but mortal doom d how can he exercise
0	wrath without end on man whom death must end 
0	can he make deathless death that were to make
0	strange contradiction which to god himself
0	impossible is held as argument
0	of weakness not of power will he draw out 
0	for angers sake finite to infinite
0	in punisht man to satisfie his rigour
0	satisfi d never that were to extend
0	his sentence beyond dust and natures law 
0	by which all causes else according still
0	to the reception of thir matter act 
0	not to th extent of thir own spheare but say
0	that death be not one stroak as i suppos d 
0	bereaving sense but endless miserie
0	from this day onward which i feel begun
0	both in me and without me and so last
0	to perpetuitie ay me that fear
0	comes thundring back with dreadful revolution
0	on my defensless head both death and i
0	am found eternal and incorporate both 
0	nor i on my part single in mee all
0	posteritie stands curst fair patrimonie
0	that i must leave ye sons o were i able
0	to waste it all my self and leave ye none 
0	so disinherited how would ye bless
0	me now your curse ah why should all mankind
0	for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn d 
0	if guiltless but from mee what can proceed 
0	but all corrupt both mind and will deprav d 
0	not to do onely but to will the same
0	with me how can they acquitted stand
0	in sight of god him after all disputes
0	forc t i absolve all my evasions vain
0	and reasonings though through mazes lead me still
0	but to my own conviction first and last
0	on mee mee onely as the sourse and spring
0	of all corruption all the blame lights due 
0	so might the wrauth fond wish couldst thou support
0	that burden heavier then the earth to bear 
0	then all the world much heavier though divided
0	with that bad woman thus what thou desir st 
0	and what thou fearst alike destroyes all hope
0	of refuge and concludes thee miserable
0	beyond all past example and future 
0	to satan onely like both crime and doom 
0	o conscience into what abyss of fears
0	and horrors hast thou driv n me out of which
0	i find no way from deep to deeper plung d 
0	thus adam to himself lamented loud
0	through the still night now now as ere man fell 
0	wholsom and cool and mild but with black air
0	accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom 
0	which to his evil conscience represented
0	all things with double terror on the ground
0	outstretcht he lay on the cold ground and oft
0	curs d his creation death as oft accus d
0	the day of his offence why comes not death 
0	said hee with one thrice acceptable stroke
0	to end me shall truth fail to keep her word 
0	justice divine not hast n to be just

0	mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries

0	if care of our descent perplex us most 
0	which must be born to certain woe devourd
0	by death at last and miserable it is
0	to be to others cause of misery 
0	our own begotten and of our loines to bring

0	food for so foule a monster in thy power
0	it lies yet ere conception to prevent

0	from loves due rites nuptial embraces sweet 
0	and with desire to languish without hope 
0	before the present object languishing
0	with like desire which would be miserie
0	and torment less then none of what we dread 
0	then both our selves and seed at once to free
0	from what we fear for both let us make short 
0	let us seek death or hee not found supply
0	with our own hands his office on our selves 
0	why stand we longer shivering under feares 
0	that shew no end but death and have the power 
0	of many wayes to die the shortest choosing 
0	destruction with destruction to destroy 
0	she ended heer or vehement despaire
0	broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts

0	to better hopes his more attentive minde
0	labouring had rais d and thus to eve repli d 
0	eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
0	to argue in thee somthing more sublime
0	and excellent then what thy minde contemnes 
0	but self destruction therefore saught refutes
0	that excellence thought in thee and implies 
0	not thy contempt but anguish and regret
0	for loss of life and pleasure overlov d 
0	or if thou covet death as utmost end
0	of miserie so thinking to evade
0	the penaltie pronounc t doubt not but god
0	hath wiselier arm d his vengeful ire then so
0	to be forestall d much more i fear least death
0	so snatcht will not exempt us from the paine
0	we are by doom to pay rather such acts
0	of contumacie will provoke the highest
0	to make death in us live then let us seek
0	som safer resolution which methinks
0	i have in view calling to minde with heed
0	part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise
0	the serpents head piteous amends unless
0	be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe
0	satan who in the serpent hath contriv d
0	against us this deceit to crush his head
0	would be revenge indeed which will be lost
0	by death brought on our selves or childless days
0	resolv d as thou proposest so our foe

0	instead shall double ours upon our heads 
0	no more be mention d then of violence

0	the hemisphere of earth in cleerest ken
0	stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay 
0	not higher that hill nor wider looking round 
0	whereon for different cause the tempter set

0	vvhich that false fruit that promis d clearer sight
0	had bred then purg d with euphrasie and rue
0	the visual nerve for he had much to see 
0	and from the vvell of life three drops instill d 
0	so deep the power of these ingredients pierc d 
0	eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight 
0	that adam now enforc t to close his eyes

0	soon rais d and his attention thus recall d

0	nor sinn d thy sin yet from that sin derive
0	corruption to bring forth more violent deeds 
0	his eyes he op nd and beheld a field 
0	part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves
0	new reapt the other part sheep walks and foulds 
0	ith midst an altar as the land mark stood
0	rustic of grassie sord thither anon
0	a sweatie reaper from his tillage brought
0	first fruits the green eare and the yellow sheaf 
0	uncull d as came to hand a shepherd next
0	more meek came with the firstlings of his flock
0	choicest and best then sacrificing laid

0	consum d with nimble glance and grateful steame 
0	the others not for his was not sincere 
0	whereat hee inlie rag d and as they talk d 
0	smote him into the midriff with a stone
0	that beat out life he fell and deadly pale
0	groand out his soul with gushing bloud effus d 
0	much at that sight was adam in his heart
0	dismai d and thus in haste to th angel cri d 
0	o teacher some great mischief hath befall n
0	to that meek man who well had sacrific d 
0	is pietie thus and pure devotion paid 
0	t whom michael thus hee also mov d repli d 
0	these two are brethren adam and to come
0	out of thy loyns th unjust the just hath slain 
0	for envie that his brothers offering found
0	from heav n acceptance but the bloodie fact
0	will be aveng d and th others faith approv d
0	loose no reward though here thou see him die 
0	rowling in dust and gore to which our sire 
0	alas both for the deed and for the cause 
0	but have i now seen death is this the way
0	i must return to native dust o sight
0	of terrour foul and ugly to behold 
0	horrid to think how horrible to feel 
0	to whom thus michael death thou hast seen
0	in his first shape on man but many shapes
0	of death and many are the wayes that lead
0	to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense
0	more terrible at th entrance then within 
0	some as thou saw st by violent stroke shall die 
0	by fire flood famin by intemperance more
0	in meats and drinks which on the earth shal bring
0	diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
0	before thee shall appear that thou mayst know
0	what miserie th inabstinence of eve
0	shall bring on men immediately a place
0	before his eyes appeard sad noysom dark 
0	a lazar house it seemd wherein were laid
0	numbers of all diseas d all maladies
0	of gastly spasm or racking torture qualmes
0	of heart sick agonie all feavorous kinds 
0	convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs 
0	intestin stone and ulcer colic pangs 
0	dropsies and asthma s and joint racking rheums 
0	dire was the tossing deep the groans despair
0	tended the sick busiest from couch to couch 
0	and over them triumphant death his dart
0	shook but delaid to strike though oft invok t
0	with vows as thir chief good and final hope 
0	sight so deform what heart of rock could long
0	drie ey d behold adam could not but wept 
0	though not of woman born compassion quell d
0	his best of man and gave him up to tears
0	a space till firmer thoughts restraind excess 
0	and scarce recovering words his plaint renew d 
0	o miserable mankind to what fall
0	degraded to what wretched state reserv d 
0	better end heer unborn why is life giv n
0	to be thus wrested from us rather why
0	obtruded on us thus who if we knew
0	what we receive would either not accept
0	life offer d or soon beg to lay it down 
0	glad to be so dismist in peace can thus
0	th image of god in man created once
0	so goodly and erect though faultie since 
0	to such unsightly sufferings be debas t
0	under inhuman pains why should not man 
0	retaining still divine similitude
0	in part from such deformities be free 
0	and for his makers image sake exempt 
0	thir makers image answerd michael then
0	forsook them when themselves they villifi d
0	to serve ungovern d appetite and took
0	his image whom they serv d a brutish vice 
0	inductive mainly to the sin of eve 
0	therefore so abject is thir punishment 
0	disfiguring not gods likeness but thir own 
0	or if his likeness by themselves defac t
0	while they pervert pure natures healthful rules
0	to loathsom sickness worthily since they
0	gods image did not reverence in themselves 
0	i yeild it just said adam and submit 
0	but is there yet no other way besides
0	these painful passages how we may come
0	to death and mix with our connatural dust 
0	there is said michael if thou well observe
0	the rule of not too much by temperance taught
0	in what thou eatst and drinkst seeking from thence
0	due nourishment not gluttonous delight 
0	till many years over thy head return 
0	so maist thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop
0	into thy mothers lap or be with ease
0	gatherd not harshly pluckt for death mature 
0	this is old age but then thou must outlive
0	thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change
0	to witherd weak gray thy senses then
0	obtuse all taste of pleasure must forgoe 
0	to what thou hast and for the aire of youth
0	hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reigne
0	a melancholly damp of cold and dry
0	to waigh thy spirits down and last consume
0	the balme of life to whom our ancestor 
0	henceforth i flie not death nor would prolong
0	life much bent rather how i may be quit
0	fairest and easiest of this combrous charge 
0	which i must keep till my appointed day
0	of rendring up michael to him repli d 
0	nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livst
0	live well how long or short permit to heav n 
0	and now prepare thee for another sight 
0	he lookd and saw a spacious plaine whereon
0	were tents of various hue by some were herds
0	of cattel grazing others whence the sound
0	of instruments that made melodious chime

0	to whom thus michael justly thou abhorr st

0	over free reason god in judgement just
0	subjects him from without to violent lords

0	by his prescript a sanctuary is fram d

0	shall rest by day a fierie gleame by night 
0	save when they journie and at length they come 
0	promisd to abraham and his seed the rest
0	were long to tell how many battels fought

0	enlightner of my darkness gracious things
0	thou hast reveald those chiefly which concerne

0	erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom
0	his day in whom all nations shall be blest 
0	favour unmerited by me who sought
0	forbidd n knowledge by forbidd n means 
0	this yet i apprehend not why to those
0	among whom god will deigne to dwell on earth
0	so many and so various laws are giv n 
0	so many laws argue so many sins
0	among them how can god with such reside 
0	to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin
0	will reign among them as of thee begot 
0	and therefore was law given them to evince
0	thir natural pravitie by stirring up
0	sin against law to fight that when they see
0	law can discover sin but not remove 
0	save by those shadowie expiations weak 
0	the bloud of bulls and goats they may conclude
0	some bloud more precious must be paid for man 
0	just for unjust that in such righteousness
0	to them by faith imputed they may finde
0	justification towards god and peace
0	of conscience which the law by ceremonies
0	cannot appease nor man the moral part
0	perform and not performing cannot live 
0	so law appears imperfet and but giv n
0	with purpose to resign them in full time

0	from shadowie types to truth from flesh to spirit 
0	from imposition of strict laws to free
0	acceptance of large grace from servil fear
0	to filial works of law to works of faith

0	by judges first then under kings of whom

0	men who attend the altar and should most
0	endeavour peace thir strife pollution brings
0	upon the temple it self at last they seise
0	the scepter and regard not davids sons 
0	then loose it to a stranger that the true

0	o prophet of glad tidings finisher
0	of utmost hope now clear i understand

0	why our great expectation should be call d
0	the seed of woman virgin mother haile 
0	high in the love of heav n yet from my loynes
0	thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son
0	of god most high so god with man unites 
0	needs must the serpent now his capital bruise
0	expect with mortal paine say where and when
0	thir fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel 
0	to whom thus michael dream not of thir fight 
0	as of a duel or the local wounds
0	of head or heel not therefore joynes the son
0	manhood to god head with more strength to foil
0	thy enemie nor so is overcome
0	satan whose fall from heav n a deadlier bruise 
0	disabl d not to give thee thy deaths wound 
0	which hee who comes thy saviour shall recure 
0	not by destroying satan but his works
0	in thee and in thy seed nor can this be 
0	but by fulfilling that which thou didst want 
0	obedience to the law of god impos d
0	on penaltie of death and suffering death 
0	the penaltie to thy transgression due 
0	and due to theirs which out of thine will grow 
0	so onely can high justice rest appaid 
0	the law of god exact he shall fulfill

0	alone fulfill the law thy punishment
0	he shall endure by coming in the flesh
0	to a reproachful life and cursed death 
0	proclaiming life to all who shall believe
0	in his redemption and that his obedience
0	imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
0	to save them not thir own though legal works 
0	for this he shall live hated be blasphem d 
0	seis d on by force judg d and to death condemnd
0	a shameful and accurst naild to the cross

0	the law that is against thee and the sins
0	of all mankinde with him there crucifi d 
0	never to hurt them more who rightly trust
0	in this his satisfaction so he dies 
0	but soon revives death over him no power
0	shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
0	returne the starres of morn shall see him rise
0	out of his grave fresh as the dawning light 
0	thy ransom paid which man from death redeems 
0	his death for man as many as offerd life
0	neglect not and the benefit imbrace
0	by faith not void of works this god like act
0	annuls thy doom the death thou shouldst have dy d 
0	in sin for ever lost from life this act
0	shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength
0	defeating sin and death his two maine armes 
0	and fix farr deeper in his head thir stings
0	then temporal death shall bruise the victors heel 
0	or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep 
0	a gentle wafting to immortal life 
0	nor after resurrection shall he stay
0	longer on earth then certaine times to appeer
0	still follow d him to them shall leave in charge
0	to teach all nations what of him they learn d
0	and his salvation them who shall beleeve

0	not onely to the sons of abrahams loines
0	salvation shall be preacht but to the sons
0	of abrahams faith wherever through the world 
0	so in his seed all nations shall be blest 
0	then to the heav n of heav ns he shall ascend
0	with victory triumphing through the aire
0	over his foes and thine there shall surprise
0	the serpent prince of aire and drag in chaines
0	through all his realme there confounded leave 
0	then enter into glory and resume

0	to judge th unfaithful dead but to reward
0	his faithful and receave them into bliss 
0	whether in heav n or earth for then the earth
0	shall all be paradise far happier place
0	then this of eden and far happier daies 
0	so spake th archangel michael then paus d 
0	as at the worlds great period and our sire
0	replete with joy and wonder thus repli d 
0	o goodness infinite goodness immense 
0	that all this good of evil shall produce 
0	and evil turn to good more wonderful
0	then that which by creation first brought forth
0	light out of darkness full of doubt i stand 
0	whether i should repent me now of sin
0	by mee done and occasiond or rejoyce
0	much more that much more good thereof shall spring 
0	to god more glory more good will to men
0	from god and over wrauth grace shall abound 
0	but say if our deliverer up to heav n
0	must reascend what will betide the few
0	his faithful left among th unfaithful herd 
0	the enemies of truth who then shall guide
0	his people who defend will they not deale
0	wors with his followers then with him they dealt 
0	be sure they will said th angel but from heav n
0	hee to his own a comforter will send 
0	the promise of the father who shall dwell
0	his spirit within them and the law of faith
0	working through love upon thir hearts shall write 
0	to guide them in all truth and also arme
0	with spiritual armour able to resist
0	satans assaults and quench his fierie darts
0	what man can do against them not affraid 
0	though to the death against such cruelties
0	with inward consolations recompenc t 
0	and oft supported so as shall amaze
0	thir proudest persecuters for the spirit
0	powrd first on his apostles whom he sends
0	to evangelize the nations then on all
0	baptiz d shall them with wondrous gifts endue
0	to speak all tongues and do all miracles 
0	as did thir lord before them thus they win
0	great numbers of each nation to receave
0	with joy the tidings brought from heav n at length
0	thir ministry perform d and race well run 
0	thir doctrine and thir story written left 
0	they die but in thir room as they forewarne 
0	wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves 
0	who all the sacred mysteries of heav n
0	to thir own vile advantages shall turne
0	of lucre and ambition and the truth
0	with superstitions and traditions taint 
0	left onely in those written records pure 
0	though not but by the spirit understood 
0	then shall they seek to avail themselves of names 
0	places and titles and with these to joine
0	secular power though feigning still to act
0	by spiritual to themselves appropriating
0	the spirit of god promisd alike and giv n
0	to all beleevers and from that pretense 
0	spiritual lawes by carnal power shall force
0	on every conscience laws which none shall finde
0	left them inrould or what the spirit within
0	shall on the heart engrave what will they then
0	but force the spirit of grace it self and binde
0	his consort libertie what but unbuild
0	his living temples built by faith to stand 
0	thir own faith not anothers for on earth
0	who against faith and conscience can be heard
0	infallible yet many will presume 
0	whence heavie persecution shall arise
0	on all who in the worship persevere
0	of spirit and truth the rest farr greater part 
0	will deem in outward rites and specious formes
0	religion satisfi d truth shall retire
0	bestuck with slandrous darts and works of faith
0	rarely be found so shall the world goe on 
0	to good malignant to bad men benigne 
0	under her own waight groaning till the day
0	appeer of respiration to the just

0	of him so lately promis d to thy aid

0	measur d this transient world the race of time 
0	till time stand fixt beyond is all abyss 
0	eternitie whose end no eye can reach 
0	greatly instructed i shall hence depart 
0	greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
0	of knowledge what this vessel can containe 
0	beyond which was my folly to aspire 
0	henceforth i learne that to obey is best 
0	and love with feare the onely god to walk
0	as in his presence ever to observe

0	merciful over all his works with good
0	still overcoming evil and by small
0	accomplishing great things by things deemd weak
0	subverting worldly strong and worldly wise
0	by simply meek that suffering for truths sake
0	is fortitude to highest victorie 
0	and to the faithful death the gate of life 
0	taught this by his example whom i now
0	acknowledge my redeemer ever blest 
0	to whom thus also th angel last repli d 
0	this having learnt thou hast attaind the summe

0	to leave this paradise but shalt possess
0	a paradise within thee happier farr 
0	let us descend now therefore from this top
0	of speculation for the hour precise
0	exacts our parting hence and see the guards 
0	by mee encampt on yonder hill expect
0	thir motion at whose front a flaming sword 
0	in signal of remove waves fiercely round 
0	we may no longer stay go waken eve 
0	her also i with gentle dreams have calm d
0	portending good and all her spirits compos d
0	to meek submission thou at season fit
0	let her with thee partake what thou hast heard 
0	chiefly what may concern her faith to know 
0	the great deliverance by her seed to come
0	that ye may live which will be many dayes 
0	both in one faith unanimous though sad 
0	with cause for evils past yet much more cheer d
0	with meditation on the happie end 
0	he ended and they both descend the hill 
0	descended adam to the bowre where eve
0	lay sleeping ran before but found her wak t 
0	and thus with words not sad she him receav d 
0	whence thou returnst whither wentst i know 
0	for god is also in sleep and dreams advise 
0	which he hath sent propitious some great good
0	presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress
0	vvearied i fell asleep but now lead on 
0	in mee is no delay with thee to goe

0	this further consolation yet secure
0	i carry hence though all by mee is lost 
0	such favour i unworthie am voutsaft 
0	by mee the promis d seed shall all restore 
0	so spake our mother eve and adam heard
0	vvell pleas d but answer d not for now too nigh
0	th archangel stood and from the other hill
0	to thir fixt station all in bright array
0	the cherubim descended on the ground
0	gliding meteorous as ev ning mist
0	ris n from a river o re the marish glides 
0	and gathers ground fast at the labourers heel
0	homeward returning high in front advanc t 
0	the brandisht sword of god before them blaz d
0	fierce as a comet which with torrid heat 
0	and vapour as the libyan air adust 
0	began to parch that temperate clime whereat
0	in either hand the hastning angel caught
0	our lingring parents and to th eastern gate
0	let them direct and down the cliff as fast

0	they looking back all th eastern side beheld
0	of paradise so late thir happie seat 
0	wav d over by that flaming brand the gate
0	with dreadful faces throng d and fierie armes

0	the world was all before them where to choose
0	thir place of rest and providence thir guide 
0	they hand in hand with wandring steps and slow 
0	through eden took thir solitarie way 
0	and hence the morning planet guilds his horns

0	the sacred truths to fable and old song
0	 so sampson groap d the temples posts in spight 
0	the world o rewhelming to revenge his sight 
0	yet as i read soon growing less severe 
0	i lik d his project the success did fear 
0	through that wide field how he his way should find
0	o re which lame faith leads understanding blind 
0	lest he perplex d the things he would explain 
0	and what was easie he should render vain 
0	or if a work so infinite he spann d 
0	jealous i was that some less skilful hand
0	 such as disquiet always what is well 
0	and by ill imitating would excell 
0	might hence presume the whole creations day
0	to change in scenes and show it in a play 
0	pardon me mighty poet nor despise
0	my causeless yet not impious surmise 
0	but i am now convinc d and none will dare
0	within thy labours to pretend a share 
0	thou hast not miss d one thought that could be fit 
0	and all that was improper dost omit 
0	so that no room is here for writers left

0	well mightst thou scorn thy readers to allure

0	o prince o chief of many throned powers 
0	that led th imbattelld seraphim to warr
0	under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds
0	fearless endanger d heav ns perpetual king

0	whether upheld by strength or chance or fate 
0	too well i see and rue the dire event 
0	that with sad overthrow and foul defeat
0	hath lost us heav n and all this mighty host

0	can perish for the mind and spirit remains
0	invincible and vigour soon returns 
0	though all our glory extinct and happy state
0	here swallow d up in endless misery

0	of force believe almighty since no less
0	then such could hav orepow rd such force as ours 
0	have left us this our spirit and strength intire
0	strongly to suffer and support our pains 
0	that we may so suffice his vengeful ire

0	by right of warr what e re his business be

0	what can it then avail though yet we feel

0	whereto with speedy words th arch fiend reply d 
0	fall n cherube to be weak is miserable
0	doing or suffering but of this be sure 
0	to do ought good never will be our task 
0	but ever to do ill our sole delight 
0	as being the contrary to his high will
0	whom we resist if then his providence
0	out of our evil seek to bring forth good 
0	our labour must be to pervert that end 
0	and out of good still to find means of evil 
0	which oft times may succeed so as perhaps
0	shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb
0	his inmost counsels from their destind aim 
0	but see the angry victor hath recall d

0	back to the gates of heav n the sulphurous hail
0	shot after us in storm oreblown hath laid
0	the fiery surge that from the precipice

0	millions that stand in arms and longing wait
0	the signal to ascend sit lingring here
0	heav ns fugitives and for thir dwelling place
0	accept this dark opprobrious den of shame 
0	by our delay no let us rather choose
0	arm d with hell flames and fury all at once
0	o re heav ns high towrs to force resistless way 
0	turning our tortures into horrid arms
0	against the torturer when to meet the noise
0	of his almighty engin he shall hear
0	black fire and horror shot with equal rage
0	among his angels and his throne it self
0	mixt with tartarean sulphur and strange fire 
0	his own invented torments but perhaps
0	the way seems difficult and steep to scale
0	with upright wing against a higher foe 
0	let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
0	of that forgetful lake benumme not still 
0	that in our proper motion we ascend
0	up to our native seat descent and fall
0	to us is adverse who but felt of late
0	when the fierce foe hung on our brok n rear
0	insulting and pursu d us through the deep 
0	with what compulsion and laborious flight
0	we sunk thus low th ascent is easie then 
0	th event is fear d should we again provoke
0	our stronger some worse way his wrath may find
0	to our destruction if there be in hell
0	fear to be worse destroy d what can be worse
0	then to dwell here driv n out from bliss condemn d
0	in this abhorred deep to utter woe 
0	where pain of unextinguishable fire
0	must exercise us without hope of end
0	the vassals of his anger when the scourge
0	inexorably and the torturing houre
0	calls us to penance more destroy d then thus
0	we should be quite abolisht and expire 
0	what fear we then what doubt we to incense
0	his utmost ire which to the highth enrag d 
0	will either quite consume us and reduce
0	to nothing this essential happier farr
0	then miserable to have eternal being 
0	or if our substance be indeed divine 
0	and cannot cease to be we are at worst
0	on this side nothing and by proof we feel
0	our power sufficient to disturb his heav n 
0	and with perpetual inrodes to allarme 
0	though inaccessible his fatal throne 
0	he ended frowning and his look denounc d
0	desperate revenge and battel dangerous
0	to less then gods on th other side up rose
0	belial in act more graceful and humane 
0	a fairer person lost not heav n he seemd
0	for dignity compos d and high exploit 
0	but all was false and hollow though his tongue
0	dropt manna and could make the worse appear
0	the better reason to perplex and dash
0	maturest counsels for his thoughts were low 
0	to vice industrious but to nobler deeds
0	timorous and slothful yet he pleas d the eare 
0	and with perswasive accent thus began 
0	i should be much for open warr o peers 
0	as not behind in hate if what was urg d
0	main reason to perswade immediate warr 
0	did not disswade me most and seem to cast
0	ominous conjecture on the whole success 
0	when he who most excels in fact of arms 
0	in what he counsels and in what excels
0	mistrustful grounds his courage on despair
0	and utter dissolution as the scope
0	of all his aim after some dire revenge 
0	first what revenge the towrs of heav n are fill d
0	with armed watch that render all access
0	impregnable oft on the bordering deep
0	encamp thir legions or with obscure wing
0	scout farr and wide into the realm of night 
0	scorning surprize or could we break our way
0	by force and at our heels all hell should rise
0	with blackest insurrection to confound
0	heav ns purest light yet our great enemie
0	all incorruptible would on his throne
0	sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould
0	incapable of stain would soon expel
0	her mischief and purge off the baser fire
0	victorious thus repuls d our final hope
0	is flat despair we must exasperate
0	th almighty victor to spend all his rage 
0	and that must end us that must be our cure 
0	to be no more sad cure for who would loose 
0	though full of pain this intellectual being 
0	those thoughts that wander through eternity 
0	to perish rather swallowd up and lost
0	in the wide womb of uncreated night 
0	devoid of sense and motion and who knows 
0	let this be good whether our angry foe
0	can give it or will ever how he can
0	is doubtful that he never will is sure 
0	will he so wise let loose at once his ire 
0	belike through impotence or unaware 
0	to give his enemies thir wish and end
0	them in his anger whom his anger saves
0	to punish endless wherefore cease we then 
0	say they who counsel warr we are decreed 
0	reserv d and destin d to eternal woe 
0	whatever doing what can we suffer more 
0	what can we suffer worse is this then worst 
0	thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms 
0	what when we fled amain pursu d and strook
0	with heav ns afflicting thunder and besought
0	the deep to shelter us this hell then seem d
0	a refuge from those wounds or when we lay
0	chain d on the burning lake that sure was worse 
0	what if the breath that kindl d those grim fires
0	awak d should blow them into sevenfold rage
0	and plunge us in the flames or from above
0	should intermitted vengeance arme again
0	his red right hand to plague us what if all
0	her stores were op n d and this firmament
0	of hell should spout her cataracts of fire 
0	impendent horrors threatning hideous fall
0	one day upon our heads while we perhaps
0	designing or exhorting glorious warr 
0	caught in a fierie tempest shall be hurl d
0	each on his rock transfixt the sport and prey
0	of racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk
0	under yon boyling ocean wrapt in chains 
0	there to converse with everlasting groans 
0	unrespited unpitied unrepreevd 
0	ages of hopeless end this would be worse 
0	warr therefore open or conceal d alike
0	my voice disswades for what can force or guile
0	with him or who deceive his mind whose eye
0	views all things at one view he from heav ns highth
0	all these our motions vain sees and derides 
0	not more almighty to resist our might
0	then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles 
0	shall we then live thus vile the race of heav n
0	thus trampl d thus expell d to suffer here
0	chains and these torments better these then worse
0	by my advice since fate inevitable
0	the victors will to suffer as to doe 
0	our strength is equal nor the law unjust
0	that so ordains this was at first resolv d 
0	if we were wise against so great a foe
0	contending and so doubtful what might fall 
0	i laugh when those who at the spear are bold
0	and vent rous if that fail them shrink and fear
0	what yet they know must follow to endure
0	exile or ignominy or bonds or pain 
0	the sentence of thir conquerour this is now
0	our doom which if we can sustain and bear 
0	our supream foe in time may much remit
0	his anger and perhaps thus farr remov d
0	not mind us not offending satisfi d
0	with what is punish t whence these raging fires
0	will slack n if his breath stir not thir flames 
0	our purer essence then will overcome
0	thir noxious vapour or enur d not feel 
0	or chang d at length and to the place conformd
0	in temper and in nature will receive
0	familiar the fierce heat and void of pain 
0	this horror will grow milde this darkness light 
0	besides what hope the never ending flight
0	of future days may bring what chance what change
0	worth waiting since our present lot appeers
0	for happy though but ill for ill not worst 
0	if we procure not to our selves more woe 
0	thus belial with words cloath d in reasons garb
0	counsel d ignoble ease and peaceful sloath 
0	not peace and after him thus mammon spake 
0	either to disinthrone the king of heav n
0	we warr if warr be best or to regain
0	our own right lost him to unthrone we then
0	may hope when everlasting fate shall yeild
0	to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife 
0	the former vain to hope argues as vain
0	the latter for what place can be for us
0	within heav ns bound unless heav ns lord supream
0	we overpower suppose he should relent
0	and publish grace to all on promise made
0	of new subjection with what eyes could we
0	stand in his presence humble and receive
0	strict laws impos d to celebrate his throne
0	with warbl d hymns and to his godhead sing
0	forc t halleluiah s while he lordly sits
0	our envied sovran and his altar breathes
0	our servile offerings this must be our task
0	in heav n this our delight how wearisom
0	eternity so spent in worship paid
0	to whom we hate let us not then pursue
0	by force impossible by leave obtain d
0	unacceptable though in heav n our state
0	of splendid vassalage but rather seek
0	our own good from our selves and from our own
0	live to our selves though in this vast recess 
0	free and to none accountable preferring
0	hard liberty before the easie yoke
0	of servile pomp our greatness will appear
0	then most conspicuous when great things of small 
0	useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse
0	we can create and in what place so e re
0	thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
0	through labour and endurance this deep world
0	of darkness do we dread how oft amidst
0	thick clouds and dark doth heav ns all ruling sire
0	choose to reside his glory unobscur d 
0	and with the majesty of darkness round
0	covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar
0	must ring thir rage and heav n resembles hell 
0	as he our darkness cannot we his light
0	imitate when we please this desart soile
0	wants not her hidden lustre gemms and gold 
0	nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
0	magnificence and what can heav n shew more 
0	our torments also may in length of time
0	become our elements these piercing fires
0	as soft as now severe our temper chang d
0	into their temper which must needs remove
0	the sensible of pain all things invite
0	to peaceful counsels and the settl d state
0	of order how in safety best we may
0	compose our present evils with regard
0	of what we are and where dismissing quite

0	he scarce had finisht when such murmur filld

0	sea faring men orewatcht whose bark by chance
0	or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
0	after the tempest such applause was heard
0	as mammon ended and his sentence pleas d 
0	advising peace for such another field
0	they dreaded worse then hell so much the fear
0	wrought still within them and no less desire
0	to found this nether empire which might rise
0	by pollicy and long process of time 
0	in emulation opposite to heav n 
0	which when beelzebub perceiv d then whom

0	a pillar of state deep on his front engraven

0	and princely counsel in his face yet shon 
0	majestick though in ruin sage he stood
0	with atlantean shoulders fit to bear
0	the weight of mightiest monarchies his look
0	drew audience and attention still as night

0	thrones and imperial powers off spring of heav n 
0	ethereal vertues or these titles now
0	must we renounce and changing stile be call d
0	princes of hell for so the popular vote
0	inclines here to continue and build up here
0	a growing empire doubtless while we dream 
0	and know not that the king of heav n hath doom d
0	this place our dungeon not our safe retreat
0	beyond his potent arm to live exempt
0	from heav ns high jurisdiction in new league
0	banded against his throne but to remaine
0	in strictest bondage though thus far remov d 
0	under th inevitable curb reserv d

0	in highth or depth still first and last will reign
0	sole king and of his kingdom loose no part
0	by our revolt but over hell extend

0	us here as with his golden those in heav n 
0	what sit we then projecting peace and warr 
0	warr hath determin d us and foild with loss
0	irreparable tearms of peace yet none
0	voutsaf t or sought for what peace will be giv n
0	to us enslav d but custody severe

0	inflicted and what peace can we return 
0	but to our power hostility and hate 
0	untam d reluctance and revenge though slow 
0	yet ever plotting how the conquerour least
0	may reap his conquest and may least rejoyce
0	in doing what we most in suffering feel 
0	nor will occasion want nor shall we need
0	with dangerous expedition to invade
0	heav n whose high walls fear no assault or siege

0	som advantagious act may be achiev d
0	by sudden onset either with hell fire
0	to waste his whole creation or possess

0	the punie habitants or if not drive 
0	seduce them to our party that thir god

0	in his disturbance when his darling sons
0	hurl d headlong to partake with us shall curse
0	thir frail originals and faded bliss 
0	faded so soon advise if this be worth
0	attempting or to sit in darkness here
0	hatching vain empires thus beelzebub
0	pleaded his devilish counsel first devis d

0	but from the author of all ill could spring
0	so deep a malice to confound the race
0	of mankind in one root and earth with hell
0	to mingle and involve done all to spite
0	the great creatour but thir spite still serves
0	his glory to augment the bold design
0	pleas d highly those infernal states and joy
0	sparkl d in all thir eyes with full assent
0	they vote whereat his speech he thus renews 
0	well have ye judg d well ended long debate

0	great things resolv d which from the lowest deep
0	will once more lift us up in spight of fate

0	dwell not unvisited of heav ns fair light
0	secure and at the brightning orient beam
0	purge off this gloom the soft delicious air 
0	to heal the scarr of these corrosive fires
0	shall breath her balme but first whom shall we send
0	in search of this new world whom shall we find
0	sufficient who shall tempt with wandring feet
0	the dark unbottom d infinite abyss
0	and through the palpable obscure find out
0	his uncouth way or spread his aerie flight
0	upborn with indefatigable wings
0	over the vast abrupt ere he arrive
0	the happy ile what strength what art can then
0	suffice or what evasion bear him safe
0	through the strict senteries and stations thick
0	of angels watching round here he had need

0	the weight of all and our last hope relies 
0	this said he sat and expectation held

0	in others count nance red his own dismay
0	astonisht none among the choice and prime
0	of those heav n warring champions could be found
0	so hardie as to proffer or accept

0	that spot to which i point is paradise 
0	adams abode those loftie shades his bowre 
0	thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires 
0	thus said he turnd and satan bowing low 
0	as to superior spirits is wont in heaven 
0	where honour due and reverence none neglects 
0	took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath 
0	down from th ecliptic sped with hop d success

0	o for that warning voice which he who saw

0	then when the dragon put to second rout

0	of that first battel and his flight to hell 
0	yet not rejoycing in his speed though bold 
0	far off and fearless nor with cause to boast 
0	begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth
0	now rowling boiles in his tumultuous brest 
0	and like a devillish engine back recoiles
0	upon himself horror and doubt distract
0	his troubl d thoughts and from the bottom stirr
0	the hell within him for within him hell
0	he brings and round about him nor from hell
0	one step no more then from himself can fly
0	by change of place now conscience wakes despair
0	that slumberd wakes the bitter memorie
0	of what he was what is and what must be
0	worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue 
0	sometimes towards eden which now in his view
0	lay pleasant his grievd look he fixes sad 
0	sometimes towards heav n and the full blazing sun 
0	which now sat high in his meridian towre 
0	then much revolving thus in sighs began 
0	o thou that with surpassing glory crownd 
0	look st from thy sole dominion like the god
0	of this new world at whose sight all the starrs
0	hide thir diminisht heads to thee i call 
0	but with no friendly voice and add thy name
0	o sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams
0	that bring to my remembrance from what state
0	i fell how glorious once above thy spheare 
0	till pride and worse ambition threw me down
0	warring in heav n against heav ns matchless king 
0	ah wherefore he deservd no such return
0	from me whom he created what i was
0	in that bright eminence and with his good
0	upbraided none nor was his service hard 
0	what could be less then to afford him praise 
0	the easiest recompence and pay him thanks 
0	how due yet all his good prov d ill in me 
0	and wrought but malice lifted up so high
0	i sdeind subjection and thought one step higher
0	would set me highest and in a moment quit
0	the debt immense of endless gratitude 
0	so burthensome still paying still to ow 
0	forgetful what from him i still receivd 
0	and understood not that a grateful mind
0	by owing owes not but still pays at once
0	indebted and dischargd what burden then 
0	o had his powerful destiny ordaind
0	me some inferiour angel i had stood
0	then happie no unbounded hope had rais d
0	ambition yet why not som other power
0	as great might have aspir d and me though mean
0	drawn to his part but other powers as great
0	fell not but stand unshak n from within
0	or from without to all temptations arm d 
0	hadst thou the same free will and power to stand 
0	thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse 
0	but heav ns free love dealt equally to all 
0	be then his love accurst since love or hate 
0	to me alike it deals eternal woe 
0	nay curs d be thou since against his thy will
0	chose freely what it now so justly rues 
0	me miserable which way shall i flie
0	infinite wrauth and infinite despaire 
0	which way i flie is hell my self am hell 
0	and in the lowest deep a lower deep
0	still threatning to devour me opens wide 
0	to which the hell i suffer seems a heav n 
0	o then at last relent is there no place
0	left for repentance none for pardon left 
0	none left but by submission and that word
0	disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
0	among the spirits beneath whom i seduc d
0	with other promises and other vaunts
0	then to submit boasting i could subdue
0	th omnipotent ay me they little know
0	how dearly i abide that boast so vaine 
0	under what torments inwardly i groane 
0	while they adore me on the throne of hell 
0	with diadem and scepter high advanc d
0	the lower still i fall onely supream
0	in miserie such joy ambition findes 
0	but say i could repent and could obtaine
0	by act of grace my former state how soon
0	would highth recal high thoughts how soon unsay
0	what feign d submission swore ease would recant
0	vows made in pain as violent and void 
0	for never can true reconcilement grow
0	where wounds of deadly hate have peirc d so deep 
0	which would but lead me to a worse relapse
0	and heavier fall so should i purchase deare
0	short intermission bought with double smart 
0	this knows my punisher therefore as farr
0	from granting hee as i from begging peace 
0	all hope excluded thus behold in stead
0	of us out cast exil d his new delight 
0	mankind created and for him this world 
0	so farwel hope and with hope farwel fear

0	divided empire with heav ns king i hold

0	thus while he spake each passion dimm d his face

0	a silvan scene and as the ranks ascend
0	shade above shade a woodie theatre
0	of stateliest view yet higher then thir tops
0	the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung 
0	which to our general sire gave prospect large
0	into his neather empire neighbouring round 
0	and higher then that wall a circling row
0	of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit 
0	blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue
0	appeerd with gay enameld colours mixt

0	and from whom i was formd flesh of thy flesh 
0	and without whom am to no end my guide
0	and head what thou hast said is just and right 
0	for wee to him indeed all praises owe 
0	and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy
0	so farr the happier lot enjoying thee
0	preeminent by so much odds while thou
0	like consort to thy self canst no where find 
0	that day i oft remember when from sleep
0	i first awak t and found my self repos d
0	under a shade on flours much wondring where
0	and what i was whence thither brought and how 
0	not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
0	of waters issu d from a cave and spread
0	into a liquid plain then stood unmov d
0	pure as th expanse of heav n i thither went
0	with unexperienc t thought and laid me downe
0	on the green bank to look into the cleer
0	smooth lake that to me seemd another skie 
0	as i bent down to look just opposite 
0	a shape within the watry gleam appeerd
0	bending to look on me i started back 
0	it started back but pleasd i soon returnd 
0	pleas d it returnd as soon with answering looks
0	of sympathie and love there i had fixt
0	mine eyes till now and pin d with vain desire 
0	had not a voice thus warnd me what thou seest 
0	what there thou seest fair creature is thy self 
0	with thee it came and goes but follow me 
0	and i will bring thee where no shadow staies
0	thy coming and thy soft imbraces hee
0	whose image thou art him thou shall enjoy
0	inseparablie thine to him shalt beare
0	multitudes like thy self and thence be call d
0	mother of human race what could i doe 
0	but follow strait invisibly thus led 
0	till i espi d thee fair indeed and tall 
0	under a platan yet methought less faire 
0	less winning soft less amiablie milde 
0	then that smooth watry image back i turnd 
0	thou following cryd st aloud return fair eve 
0	whom fli st thou whom thou fli st of him thou art 
0	his flesh his bone to give thee being i lent
0	out of my side to thee neerest my heart
0	substantial life to have thee by my side
0	henceforth an individual solace dear 
0	part of my soul i seek thee and thee claim
0	my other half with that thy gentle hand
0	seisd mine i yeilded and from that time see
0	how beauty is excelld by manly grace
0	and wisdom which alone is truly fair 
0	so spake our general mother and with eyes
0	of conjugal attraction unreprov d 
0	and meek surrender half imbracing leand
0	on our first father half her swelling breast
0	naked met his under the flowing gold
0	of her loose tresses hid he in delight
0	both of her beauty and submissive charms
0	smil d with superior love as jupiter
0	on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
0	that shed may flowers and press d her matron lip
0	with kisses pure aside the devil turnd
0	for envie yet with jealous leer maligne
0	ey d them askance and to himself thus plaind 
0	sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two
0	imparadis t in one anothers arms
0	the happier eden shall enjoy thir fill
0	of bliss on bliss while i to hell am thrust 
0	where neither joy nor love but fierce desire 
0	among our other torments not the least 
0	still unfulfill d with pain of longing pines 
0	yet let me not forget what i have gain d
0	from thir own mouths all is not theirs it seems 
0	one fatal tree there stands of knowledge call d 
0	forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidd n 
0	suspicious reasonless why should thir lord
0	envie them that can it be sin to know 
0	can it be death and do they onely stand
0	by ignorance is that thir happie state 
0	the proof of thir obedience and thir faith 
0	o fair foundation laid whereon to build
0	thir ruine hence i will excite thir minds
0	with more desire to know and to reject
0	envious commands invented with designe
0	to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
0	equal with gods aspiring to be such 
0	they taste and die what likelier can ensue 
0	but first with narrow search i must walk round
0	this garden and no corner leave unspi d 
0	a chance but chance may lead where i may meet
0	some wandring spirit of heav n by fountain side 
0	or in thick shade retir d from him to draw
0	what further would be learnt live while ye may 
0	yet happie pair enjoy till i return 
0	short pleasures for long woes are to succeed 
0	so saying his proud step he scornful turn d 
0	but with sly circumspection and began
0	through wood through waste o re hil o re dale his roam 
0	mean while in utmost longitude where heav n
0	with earth and ocean meets the setting sun
0	slowly descended and with right aspect
0	against the eastern gate of paradise
0	leveld his eevning rayes it was a rock
0	of alablaster pil d up to the clouds 
0	conspicuous farr winding with one ascent
0	accessible from earth one entrance high 
0	the rest was craggie cliff that overhung
0	still as it rose impossible to climbe 
0	betwixt these rockie pillars gabriel sat
0	chief of th angelic guards awaiting night 
0	about him exercis d heroic games
0	th unarmed youth of heav n but nigh at hand
0	hung high with diamond flaming and with gold 
0	thither came uriel gliding through the eeven
0	on a sun beam swift as a shooting starr
0	in autumn thwarts the night when vapors fir d

0	from what point of his compass to beware
0	impetuous winds he thus began in haste 
0	gabriel to thee thy cours by lot hath giv n
0	charge and strict watch that to this happie place
0	no evil thing approach or enter in 
0	this day at highth of noon came to my spheare

0	gods latest image i describ d his way
0	bent all on speed and markt his aerie gate

0	lost sight of him one of the banisht crew
0	i fear hath ventur d from the deep to raise

0	by shorter flight to th east had left him there
0	arraying with reflected purple and gold
0	the clouds that on his western throne attend 
0	now came still eevning on and twilight gray
0	had in her sober liverie all things clad 
0	silence accompanied for beast and bird

0	our circuit meets full west as flame they part
0	half wheeling to the shield half to the spear 
0	from these two strong and suttle spirits he calld

0	ithuriel and zephon with wingd speed
0	search through this garden leav unsearcht no nook

0	who tells of som infernal spirit seen
0	hitherward bent who could have thought escap d
0	the barrs of hell on errand bad no doubt 
0	such where ye find seise fast and hither bring 
0	so saying on he led his radiant files 
0	daz ling the moon these to the bower direct
0	in search of whom they sought him there they found
0	squat like a toad close at the eare of eve 
0	assaying by his devilish art to reach
0	the organs of her fancie and with them forge
0	illusions as he list phantasms and dreams 
0	or if inspiring venom he might taint
0	th animal spirits that from pure blood arise
0	like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
0	at least distemperd discontented thoughts 
0	vain hopes vain aimes inordinate desires
0	blown up with high conceits ingendring pride 
0	him thus intent ithuriel with his spear
0	touch d lightly for no falshood can endure
0	touch of celestial temper but returns
0	of force to its own likeness up he starts
0	discoverd and surpriz d as when a spark
0	lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
0	fit for the tun som magazin to store
0	against a rumord warr the smuttie graine
0	with sudden blaze diffus d inflames the aire 
0	so started up in his own shape the fiend 
0	back stept those two fair angels half amaz d
0	so sudden to behold the grieslie king 
0	yet thus unmovd with fear accost him soon 
0	which of those rebell spirits adjudg d to hell
0	com st thou escap d thy prison and transform d 
0	why satst thou like an enemie in waite
0	here watching at the head of these that sleep 
0	know ye not then said satan filld with scorn 
0	know ye not me ye knew me once no mate
0	for you there sitting where ye durst not soare 
0	not to know mee argues your selves unknown 
0	the lowest of your throng or if ye know

0	to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn 
0	think not revolted spirit thy shape the same 
0	or undiminisht brightness to be known
0	as when thou stoodst in heav n upright and pure 
0	that glorie then when thou no more wast good 
0	departed from thee and thou resembl st now
0	thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule 
0	but come for thou be sure shalt give account
0	to him who sent us whose charge is to keep
0	this place inviolable and these from harm 
0	so spake the cherube and his grave rebuke
0	severe in youthful beautie added grace
0	invincible abasht the devil stood 
0	and felt how awful goodness is and saw
0	vertue in her shape how lovly saw and pin d
0	his loss but chiefly to find here observd
0	his lustre visibly impar d yet seemd
0	undaunted if i must contend said he 
0	best with the best the sender not the sent 
0	or all at once more glorie will be wonn 
0	or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold 
0	will save us trial what the least can doe
0	single against thee wicked and thence weak 
0	the fiend repli d not overcome with rage 
0	but like a proud steed reind went hautie on 
0	chaumping his iron curb to strive or flie
0	he held it vain awe from above had quelld
0	his heart not else dismai d now drew they nigh
0	the western point where those half rounding guards
0	just met closing stood in squadron joind
0	awaiting next command to whom thir chief
0	gabriel from the front thus calld aloud 
0	o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet
0	hasting this way and now by glimps discerne
0	ithuriel and zephon through the shade 
0	and with them comes a third of regal port 
0	but faded splendor wan who by his gate
0	and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell 
0	not likely to part hence without contest 
0	stand firm for in his look defiance lours 
0	he scarce had ended when those two approachd
0	and brief related whom they brought wher found 
0	how busied in what form and posture coucht 
0	to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake 
0	why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescrib d
0	to thy transgressions and disturbd the charge
0	of others who approve not to transgress
0	by thy example but have power and right
0	to question thy bold entrance on this place 
0	imploi d it seems to violate sleep and those
0	whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss 
0	to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow 
0	gabriel thou hadst in heav n th esteem of wise 
0	and such i held thee but this question askt
0	puts me in doubt lives ther who loves his pain 
0	who would not finding way break loose from hell 
0	though thither doomd thou wouldst thy self no doubt 
0	and boldly venture to whatever place
0	farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
0	torment with ease soonest recompence
0	dole with delight which in this place i sought 
0	to thee no reason who knowst only good 
0	but evil hast not tri d and wilt object
0	his will who bound us let him surer barr
0	his iron gates if he intends our stay
0	in that dark durance thus much what was askt 
0	the rest is true they found me where they say 
0	but that implies not violence or harme 
0	thus hee in scorn the warlike angel mov d 
0	disdainfully half smiling thus repli d 
0	o loss of one in heav n to judge of wise 
0	since satan fell whom follie overthrew 
0	and now returns him from his prison scap t 
0	gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
0	or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
0	unlicenc t from his bounds in hell prescrib d 
0	so wise he judges it to fly from pain
0	however and to scape his punishment 
0	so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrauth 
0	which thou incurr st by flying meet thy flight
0	seavenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell 
0	which taught thee yet no better that no pain
0	can equal anger infinite provok t 
0	but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee
0	came not all hell broke loose is pain to them
0	less pain less to be fled or thou then they
0	less hardie to endure courageous chief 
0	the first in flight from pain had st thou alleg d
0	to thy deserted host this cause of flight 
0	thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive 
0	to which the fiend thus answerd frowning stern 
0	not that i less endure or shrink from pain 
0	insulting angel well thou knowst i stood
0	thy fiercest when in battel to thy aide
0	the blasting volied thunder made all speed
0	and seconded thy else not dreaded spear 
0	but still thy words at random as before 
0	argue thy inexperience what behooves
0	from hard assaies and ill successes past
0	a faithful leader not to hazard all
0	through wayes of danger by himself untri d 
0	i therefore i alone first undertook
0	to wing the desolate abyss and spie
0	this new created world whereof in hell
0	fame is not silent here in hope to find
0	better abode and my afflicted powers
0	to settle here on earth or in mid aire 
0	though for possession put to try once more
0	what thou and thy gay legions dare against 
0	whose easier business were to serve thir lord
0	high up in heav n with songs to hymne his throne 
0	and practis d distances to cringe not fight 
0	to whom the warriour angel soon repli d 
0	to say and strait unsay pretending first
0	wise to flie pain professing next the spie 
0	argues no leader but a lyar trac t 
0	satan and couldst thou faithful add o name 
0	o sacred name of faithfulness profan d 
0	faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew 
0	armie of fiends fit body to fit head 
0	was this your discipline and faith ingag d 
0	your military obedience to dissolve
0	allegeance to th acknowledg d power supream 
0	and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
0	patron of liberty who more then thou
0	once fawn d and cring d and servilly ador d
0	heav ns awful monarch wherefore but in hope
0	to dispossess him and thy self to reigne 
0	but mark what i arreede thee now avant 
0	flie thither whence thou fledst if from this houre
0	within these hallowd limits thou appeer 
0	back to th infernal pit i drag thee chaind 
0	and seale thee so as henceforth not to scorne
0	the facil gates of hell too slightly barrd 
0	so threatn d hee but satan to no threats
0	gave heed but waxing more in rage repli d 
0	then when i am thy captive talk of chaines 
0	proud limitarie cherube but ere then
0	farr heavier load thy self expect to feel
0	from my prevailing arme though heavens king
0	ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers

0	in progress through the rode of heav n star pav d 
0	while thus he spake th angelic squadron bright
0	turnd fierie red sharpning in mooned hornes

0	with ported spears as thick as when a field
0	of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends

0	swayes them the careful plowman doubting stands
0	least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves
0	prove chaff on th other side satan allarm d
0	collecting all his might dilated stood 
0	like teneriff or atlas unremov d 
0	his stature reacht the skie and on his crest
0	sat horror plum d nor wanted in his graspe
0	what seemd both spear and shield now dreadful deeds
0	might have ensu d nor onely paradise
0	in this commotion but the starrie cope
0	of heav n perhaps or all the elements
0	at least had gon to rack disturbd and torne
0	with violence of this conflict had not soon

0	hung forth in heav n his golden scales yet seen

0	wherein all things created first he weighd 
0	the pendulous round earth with ballanc t aire
0	in counterpoise now ponders all events 
0	battels and realms in these he put two weights
0	the sequel each of parting and of fight 
0	the latter quick up flew and kickt the beam

0	where thou art weigh d shown how light how weak 
0	if thou resist the fiend lookt up and knew
0	his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled
0	murmuring and with him fled the shades of night 
0	now morn her rosie steps in th eastern clime
0	advancing sow d the earth with orient pearle 
0	when adam wak t so customd for his sleep
0	was aerie light from pure digestion bred 
0	and temperat vapors bland which th only sound
0	of leaves and fuming rills aurora s fan 
0	lightly dispers d and the shrill matin song
0	of birds on every bough so much the more
0	his wonder was to find unwak nd eve
0	with tresses discompos d and glowing cheek 
0	as through unquiet rest he on his side
0	leaning half rais d with looks of cordial love
0	hung over her enamour d and beheld
0	beautie which whether waking or asleep 
0	shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
0	milde as when zephyrus on flora breathes 
0	her hand soft touching whisperd thus awake
0	my fairest my espous d my latest found 
0	heav ns last best gift my ever new delight 
0	awake the morning shines and the fresh field
0	calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
0	our tended plants how blows the citron grove 
0	what drops the myrrhe what the balmie reed 
0	how nature paints her colours how the bee
0	sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet 
0	such whispering wak d her but with startl d eye
0	on adam whom imbracing thus she spake 
0	o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose 
0	my glorie my perfection glad i see
0	thy face and morn return d for i this night 
0	such night till this i never pass d have dream d 
0	if dream d not as i oft am wont of thee 
0	works of day pass t or morrows next designe 
0	but of offence and trouble which my mind
0	knew never till this irksom night methought
0	close at mine ear one call d me forth to walk
0	with gentle voice i thought it thine it said 
0	why sleepst thou eve now is the pleasant time 
0	the cool the silent save where silence yields
0	to the night warbling bird that now awake
0	tunes sweetest his love labor d song now reignes
0	full orb d the moon and with more pleasing light
0	shadowie sets off the face of things in vain 
0	if none regard heav n wakes with all his eyes 
0	whom to behold but thee natures desire 
0	in whose sight all things joy with ravishment
0	attracted by thy beauty still to gaze 
0	i rose as at thy call but found thee not 
0	to find thee i directed then my walk 
0	and on methought alone i pass d through ways
0	that brought me on a sudden to the tree
0	of interdicted knowledge fair it seem d 
0	much fairer to my fancie then by day 
0	and as i wondring lookt beside it stood
0	one shap d and wing d like one of those from heav n
0	by us oft seen his dewie locks distill d
0	ambrosia on that tree he also gaz d 
0	and o fair plant said he with fruit surcharg d 
0	deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet 
0	nor god nor man is knowledge so despis d 
0	or envie or what reserve forbids to taste 
0	forbid who will none shall from me withhold
0	longer thy offerd good why else set here 
0	this said he paus d not but with ventrous arme
0	he pluckt he tasted mee damp horror chil d
0	at such bold words voucht with a deed so bold 
0	but he thus overjoy d o fruit divine 
0	sweet of thy self but much more sweet thus cropt 
0	forbidd n here it seems as onely fit
0	for gods yet able to make gods of men 
0	and why not gods of men since good the more
0	communicated more abundant growes 
0	the author not impair d but honourd more 
0	here happie creature fair angelic eve 
0	partake thou also happie though thou art 
0	happier thou mayst be worthier canst not be 
0	taste this and be henceforth among the gods
0	thy self a goddess not to earth confind 
0	but somtimes in the air as wee somtimes
0	ascend to heav n by merit thine and see
0	what life the gods live there and such live thou 
0	so saying he drew nigh and to me held 
0	even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
0	which he had pluckt the pleasant savourie smell
0	so quick nd appetite that i methought 
0	could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds
0	with him i flew and underneath beheld
0	the earth outstretcht immense a prospect wide
0	and various wondring at my flight and change
0	to this high exaltation suddenly
0	my guide was gon and i me thought sunk down 
0	and fell asleep but o how glad i wak d
0	to find this but a dream thus eve her night
0	related and thus adam answerd sad 
0	best image of my self and dearer half 
0	the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
0	affects me equally nor can i like
0	this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear 
0	yet evil whence in thee can harbour none 
0	created pure but know that in the soule
0	are many lesser faculties that serve
0	reason as chief among these fansie next
0	her office holds of all external things 
0	which the five watchful senses represent 
0	she forms imaginations aerie shapes 
0	which reason joyning or disjoyning frames
0	all what we affirm or what deny and call
0	our knowledge or opinion then retires
0	into her private cell when nature rests 
0	oft in her absence mimic fansie wakes
0	to imitate her but misjoyning shapes 
0	wilde work produces oft and most in dreams 
0	ill matching words and deeds long past or late 
0	som such resemblances methinks i find
0	of our last eevnings talk in this thy dream 
0	but with addition strange yet be not sad 
0	evil into the mind of god or man
0	may come and go so unapprov d and leave
0	no spot or blame behind which gives me hope
0	that what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream 
0	waking thou never wilt consent to do 
0	be not disheart nd then nor cloud those looks
0	that wont to be more chearful and serene
0	then when fair morning first smiles on the world 
0	and let us to our fresh imployments rise
0	that open now thir choicest bosom d smells
0	reservd from night and kept for thee in store 
0	so cheard he his fair spouse and she was cheard 
0	but silently a gentle tear let fall
0	from either eye and wip d them with her haire 
0	two other precious drops that ready stood 
0	each in thir chrystal sluce hee ere they fell
0	kiss d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
0	and pious awe that feard to have offended 
0	so all was cleard and to the field they haste

0	light issues forth and at the other dore

0	victor though brutish that contest and foule 
0	when reason hath to deal with force yet so
0	most reason is that reason overcome 
0	so pondering and from his armed peers

0	to god or thee because we have a foe
0	may tempt it i expected not to hear 
0	his violence thou fearst not being such

0	can either not receave or can repell 
0	his fraud is then thy fear which plain inferrs

0	the tempted with dishonour foul suppos d
0	not incorruptible of faith not prooff
0	against temptation thou thy self with scorne
0	and anger wouldst resent the offer d wrong 
0	though ineffectual found misdeem not then 
0	if such affront i labour to avert
0	from thee alone which on us both at once
0	the enemie though bold will hardly dare 
0	or daring first on mee th assault shall light

0	more wise more watchful stronger if need were

0	would utmost vigor raise and rais d unite 
0	why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
0	when i am present and thy trial choose
0	with me best witness of thy vertue tri d 
0	so spake domestick adam in his care

0	less attributed to her faith sincere 
0	thus her reply with accent sweet renewd 
0	if this be our condition thus to dwell
0	in narrow circuit strait nd by a foe 
0	suttle or violent we not endu d
0	single with like defence wherever met 
0	how are we happie still in fear of harm 
0	but harm precedes not sin onely our foe
0	tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
0	of our integritie his foul esteeme
0	sticks no dishonor on our front but turns
0	foul on himself then wherfore shund or feard
0	by us who rather double honour gaine
0	from his surmise prov d false finde peace within

0	secure from outward force within himself
0	the danger lies yet lies within his power 
0	against his will he can receave no harme

0	the vertue of that fruit in thee first prov d 
0	but say where grows the tree from hence how far 
0	for many are the trees of god that grow
0	in paradise and various yet unknown
0	to us in such abundance lies our choice 
0	as leaves a greater store of fruit untoucht

0	fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess 
0	the credit of whose vertue rest with thee 
0	wondrous indeed if cause of such effects

0	god so commanded and left that command
0	sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
0	law to our selves our reason is our law 
0	to whom the tempter guilefully repli d

0	to whom thus eve yet sinless of the fruit
0	of each tree in the garden we may eate 
0	but of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
0	the garden god hath said ye shall not eate
0	thereof nor shall ye touch it least ye die 
0	she scarse had said though brief when now more bold
0	the tempter but with shew of zeale and love
0	to man and indignation at his wrong 
0	new part puts on and as to passion mov d 
0	fluctuats disturbd yet comely and in act

0	stood in himself collected while each part 
0	motion each act won audience ere the tongue 
0	somtimes in highth began as no delay
0	of preface brooking through his zeal of right 
0	so standing moving or to highth upgrown
0	the tempter all impassiond thus began 
0	o sacred wise and wisdom giving plant 
0	mother of science now i feel thy power
0	within me cleere not onely to discerne
0	things in thir causes but to trace the wayes
0	of highest agents deemd however wise 
0	queen of this universe doe not believe
0	those rigid threats of death ye shall not die 
0	how should ye by the fruit it gives you life
0	to knowledge by the threatner look on mee 
0	mee who have touch d and tasted yet both live 
0	and life more perfet have attaind then fate
0	meant mee by ventring higher then my lot 
0	shall that be shut to man which to the beast
0	is open or will god incense his ire
0	for such a pretty trespass and not praise
0	rather your dauntless vertue whom the pain
0	of death denounc t whatever thing death be 
0	deterrd not from atchieving what might leade
0	to happier life knowledge of good and evil 
0	of good how just of evil if what is evil
0	be real why not known since easier shunnd 
0	god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just 
0	not just not god not feard then nor obeid 
0	your feare it self of death removes the feare 
0	why then was this forbid why but to awe 
0	why but to keep ye low and ignorant 
0	his worshippers he knows that in the day
0	ye eate thereof your eyes that seem so cleere 
0	yet are but dim shall perfetly be then
0	op nd and cleerd and ye shall be as gods 
0	knowing both good and evil as they know 
0	that ye should be as gods since i as man 
0	internal man is but proportion meet 
0	i of brute human yee of human gods 
0	so ye shalt die perhaps by putting off
0	human to put on gods death to be wisht 
0	though threat nd which no worse then this can bring
0	and what are gods that man may not become
0	as they participating god like food 
0	the gods are first and that advantage use
0	on our belief that all from them proceeds 
0	i question it for this fair earth i see 
0	warm d by the sun producing every kind 
0	them nothing if they all things who enclos d
0	knowledge of good and evil in this tree 
0	that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
0	wisdom without their leave and wherein lies
0	th offence that man should thus attain to know 
0	what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
0	impart against his will if all be his 
0	or is it envie and can envie dwell
0	in heav nly brests these these and many more
0	causes import your need of this fair fruit 
0	goddess humane reach then and freely taste 
0	he ended and his words replete with guile
0	into her heart too easie entrance won 
0	fixt on the fruit she gaz d which to behold
0	might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
0	yet rung of his perswasive words impregn d
0	with reason to her seeming and with truth 
0	meanwhile the hour of noon drew on and wak d
0	an eager appetite rais d by the smell
0	so savorie of that fruit which with desire 
0	inclinable now grown to touch or taste 
0	sollicited her longing eye yet first
0	pausing a while thus to her self she mus d 
0	great are thy vertues doubtless best of fruits 
0	though kept from man worthy to be admir d 
0	whose taste too long forborn at first assay
0	gave elocution to the mute and taught
0	the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise 
0	thy praise hee also who forbids thy use 
0	conceales not from us naming thee the tree
0	of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil 
0	forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
0	commends thee more while it inferrs the good
0	by thee communicated and our want 
0	for good unknown sure is not had or had
0	and yet unknown is as not had at all 
0	in plain then what forbids he but to know 
0	forbids us good forbids us to be wise 
0	such prohibitions binde not but if death
0	bind us with after bands what profits then
0	our inward freedom in the day we eate
0	of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die 
0	how dies the serpent hee hath eat n and lives 
0	and knows and speaks and reasons and discernes 
0	irrational till then for us alone
0	was death invented or to us deni d
0	this intellectual food for beasts reserv d 
0	for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
0	hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
0	the good befall n him author unsuspect 
0	friendly to man farr from deceit or guile 
0	what fear i then rather what know to feare
0	under this ignorance of good and evil 
0	here grows the cure of all this fruit divine 
0	fair to the eye inviting to the taste 
0	of vertue to make wise what hinders then
0	to reach and feed at once both bodie and mind 
0	so saying her rash hand in evil hour
0	forth reaching to the fruit she pluck d she eat 
0	earth felt the wound and nature from her seat
0	sighing through all her works gave signs of woe 
0	that all was lost back to the thicket slunk
0	the guiltie serpent and well might for eve
0	intent now wholly on her taste naught else
0	regarded such delight till then as seemd 
0	in fruit she never tasted whether true
0	or fansied so through expectation high
0	of knowledg nor was god head from her thought 
0	greedily she ingorg d without restraint 
0	and knew not eating death satiate at length 
0	and hight nd as with wine jocond and boon 
0	thus to her self she pleasingly began 
0	o sovran vertuous precious of all trees
0	in paradise of operation blest
0	to sapience hitherto obscur d infam d 
0	and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
0	created but henceforth my early care 
0	not without song each morning and due praise
0	shall tend thee and the fertil burden ease
0	of thy full branches offer d free to all 
0	till dieted by thee i grow mature
0	in knowledge as the gods who all things know 
0	though others envie what they cannot give 
0	for had the gift bin theirs it had not here
0	thus grown experience next to thee i owe 
0	best guide not following thee i had remaind
0	in ignorance thou op nst wisdoms way 
0	and giv st access though secret she retire 
0	and i perhaps am secret heav n is high 
0	high and remote to see from thence distinct
0	each thing on earth and other care perhaps
0	may have diverted from continual watch
0	our great forbidder safe with all his spies
0	about him but to adam in what sort
0	shall i appeer shall i to him make known
0	as yet my change and give him to partake
0	full happiness with mee or rather not 
0	but keep the odds of knowledge in my power
0	without copartner so to add what wants
0	in femal sex the more to draw his love 
0	and render me more equal and perhaps
0	a thing not undesireable somtime
0	superior for inferior who is free 
0	this may be well but what if god have seen 
0	and death ensue then i shall be no more 
0	and adam wedded to another eve 
0	shall live with her enjoying i extinct 
0	a death to think confirm d then i resolve 
0	adam shall share with me in bliss or woe 
0	so dear i love him that with him all deaths
0	i could endure without him live no life 
0	so saying from the tree her step she turnd 
0	but first low reverence don as to the power
0	that dwelt within whose presence had infus d
0	into the plant sciential sap deriv d
0	from nectar drink of gods adam the while
0	waiting desirous her return had wove
0	of choicest flours a garland to adorne
0	her tresses and her rural labours crown
0	as reapers oft are wont thir harvest queen 
0	great joy he promis d to his thoughts and new
0	solace in her return so long delay d 
0	yet oft his heart divine of somthing ill 
0	misgave him hee the faultring measure felt 
0	and forth to meet her went the way she took
0	that morn when first they parted by the tree
0	of knowledge he must pass there he her met 
0	scarse from the tree returning in her hand
0	a bough of fairest fruit that downie smil d 
0	new gatherd and ambrosial smell diffus d 
0	to him she hasted in her face excuse
0	came prologue and apologie to prompt 
0	which with bland words at will she thus addrest 
0	hast thou not wonderd adam at my stay 
0	thee i have misst and thought it long depriv d
0	thy presence agonie of love till now
0	not felt nor shall be twice for never more
0	mean i to trie what rash untri d i sought 
0	the paine of absence from thy sight but strange
0	hath bin the cause and wonderful to heare 
0	this tree is not as we are told a tree
0	of danger tasted nor to evil unknown
0	op ning the way but of divine effect
0	to open eyes and make them gods who taste 
0	and hath bin tasted such the serpent wise 
0	or not restraind as wee or not obeying 
0	hath eat n of the fruit and is become 
0	not dead as we are threatn d but thenceforth
0	endu d with human voice and human sense 
0	reasoning to admiration and with mee
0	perswasively hath so prevaild that i
0	have also tasted and have also found
0	th effects to correspond opener mine eyes 
0	dimm erst dilated spirits ampler heart 
0	and growing up to godhead which for thee
0	chiefly i sought without thee can despise 
0	for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss 
0	tedious unshar d with thee and odious soon 
0	thou therefore also taste that equal lot
0	may joyne us equal joy as equal love 
0	least thou not tasting different degree
0	disjoyne us and i then too late renounce
0	deitie for thee when fate will not permit 
0	thus eve with countnance blithe her storie told 
0	but in her cheek distemper flushing glowd 
0	on th other side adam soon as he heard
0	the fatal trespass don by eve amaz d 
0	astonied stood and blank while horror chill
0	ran through his veins and all his joynts relax d 
0	from his slack hand the garland wreath d for eve
0	down drop d and all the faded roses shed 
0	speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
0	first to himself he inward silence broke 
0	o fairest of creation last and best
0	of all gods works creature in whom excell d
0	whatever can to fight or thought be found 
0	holy divine good amiable or sweet 
0	how art thou lost how on a sudden lost 
0	defac t deflourd and now to death devote 
0	rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress
0	the strict forbiddance how to violate
0	the sacred fruit forbidd n som cursed fraud
0	of enemie hath beguil d thee yet unknown 
0	and mee with thee hath ruind for with thee
0	certain my resolution is to die 
0	how can i live without thee how forgoe
0	thy sweet converse and love so dearly joyn d 
0	to live again in these wilde woods forlorn 
0	should god create another eve and i

0	would never from my heart no no i feel

0	bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
0	mine never shall be parted bliss or woe 
0	so having said as one from sad dismay
0	recomforted and after thoughts disturbd
0	submitting to what seemd remediless 
0	thus in calme mood his words to eve he turnd 
0	bold deed thou hast presum d adventrous eve 
0	and peril great provok t who thus hast dar d
0	had it bin onely coveting to eye
0	that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence 
0	much more to taste it under banne to touch 
0	but past who can recall or don undoe 
0	not god omnipotent for fate yet so
0	perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
0	is not so hainous now foretasted fruit 
0	profan d first by the serpent by him first
0	made common and unhallowd ere one tastes 
0	nor yet on him found deadly he yet lives 
0	lives as thou saidst and gaines to live as man
0	higher degree of life inducement strong
0	to us as likely tasting to attaine
0	proportional ascent which cannot be
0	but to be gods or angels demi gods 
0	nor can i think that god creator wise

0	about thir spirits had plaid and inmost powers
0	made erre was now exhal d and grosser sleep
0	bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
0	encumberd now had left them up they rose

0	to guiltie shame hee cover d but his robe

0	at length gave utterance to these words constraind 
0	o eve in evil hour thou didst give care
0	to that false worm of whomsoever taught
0	to counterfet mans voice true in our fall 
0	false in our promis d rising since our eyes
0	op nd we find indeed and find we know

0	bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know 
0	which leaves us naked thus of honour void 
0	our wonted ornaments now soild and staind 
0	and in our faces evident the signes
0	of foul concupiscence whence evil store 
0	even shame the last of evils of the first
0	be sure then how shall i behold the face
0	henceforth of god or angel earst with joy
0	and rapture so oft beheld those heav nly shapes
0	will dazle now this earthly with thir blaze
0	insufferably bright o might i here
0	in solitude live savage in some glad
0	obscur d where highest woods impenetrable
0	to starr or sun light spread thir umbrage broad 
0	and brown as evening cover me ye pines 
0	ye cedars with innumerable boughs
0	hide me where i may never see them more 
0	but let us now as in bad plight devise
0	what best may for the present serve to hide
0	the parts of each from other that seem most
0	to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen 
0	some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sowd 
0	and girded on our loyns may cover round
0	those middle parts that this new commer shame 
0	there sit not and reproach us as unclean 
0	so counsel d hee and both together went
0	into the thickest wood there soon they chose
0	the figtree not that kind for fruit renown d 
0	but such as at this day to indians known
0	in malabar or decan spreds her armes
0	braunching so broad and long that in the ground
0	the bended twigs take root and daughters grow
0	about the mother tree a pillard shade
0	high overarch t and echoing walks between 
0	there oft the indian herdsman shunning heate
0	shelters in coole and tends his pasturing herds
0	at loopholes cut through thickest shade those leaves
0	they gatherd broad as amazonian targe 
0	and with what skill they had together sowd 
0	to gird thir waste vain covering if to hide
0	thir guilt and dreaded shame o how unlike
0	to that first naked glorie such of late
0	columbus found th american to girt
0	with featherd cincture naked else and wilde
0	among the trees on iles and woodie shores 
0	thus fenc t and as they thought thir shame in part
0	coverd but not at rest or ease of mind 
0	they sate them down to weep nor onely teares
0	raind at thir eyes but high winds worse within
0	began to rise high passions anger hate 
0	mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore
0	thir inward state of mind calme region once
0	and full of peace now tost and turbulent 
0	for understanding rul d not and the will
0	heard not her lore both in subjection now

0	remaind still happie not as now despoild

0	what words have past thy lips adam severe 
0	imput st thou that to my default or will
0	of wandering as thou call st it which who knows
0	but might as ill have happ nd thou being by 
0	or to thy self perhaps hadst thou bin there

0	as good have grown there still a liveless rib 
0	being as i am why didst not thou the head
0	command me absolutely not to go 
0	going into such danger as thou saidst 
0	too facil then thou didst not much gainsay

0	immutable when thou wert lost not i 
0	who might have liv d and joyd immortal bliss

0	and am i now upbraided as the cause
0	of thy transgressing not enough severe 
0	it seems in thy restraint what could i more 
0	i warn d thee i admonish d thee foretold
0	the danger and the lurking enemie
0	that lay in wait beyond this had bin force 
0	and force upon free will hath here no place 
0	but confidence then bore thee on secure
0	either to meet no danger or to finde
0	matter of glorious trial and perhaps
0	i also err d in overmuch admiring
0	what seemd in thee so perfet that i thought
0	no evil durst attempt thee but i rue
0	that errour now which is become my crime 
0	and thou th accuser thus it shall befall
0	him who to worth in women overtrusting
0	lets her will rule restraint she will not brook

0	shee first his weak indulgence will accuse 
0	thus they in mutual accusation spent
0	the fruitless hours but neither self condemning
0	and of thir vain contest appeer d no end 
0	meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act
0	of satan done in paradise and how

0	thus saying from his radiant seat he rose
0	of high collateral glorie him thrones and powers 
0	princedoms and dominations ministrant
0	accompanied to heaven gate from whence
0	eden and all the coast in prospect lay 
0	down he descended strait the speed of gods
0	time counts not though with swiftest minutes wing d 
0	now was the sun in western cadence low
0	from noon and gentle aires due at thir hour
0	to fan the earth now wak d and usher in
0	the eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole
0	came the mild judge and intercessor both
0	to sentence man the voice of god they heard
0	now walking in the garden by soft windes
0	brought to thir ears while day declin d they heard
0	and from his presence hid themselves among
0	the thickest trees both man and wife till god
0	approaching thus to adam call d aloud 
0	where art thou adam wont with joy to meet
0	my coming seen far off i miss thee here 
0	not pleas d thus entertaind with solitude 
0	where obvious dutie erewhile appear d unsaught 
0	or come i less conspicuous or what change
0	absents thee or what chance detains come forth 
0	he came and with him eve more loth though first
0	to offend discount nanc t both and discompos d 
0	love was not in thir looks either to god
0	or to each other but apparent guilt 
0	and shame and perturbation and despaire 
0	anger and obstinacie and hate and guile 
0	whence adam faultring long thus answer d brief 
0	i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
0	affraid being naked hid my self to whom
0	the gracious judge without revile repli d 
0	my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not fear d 
0	but still rejoyc t how is it now become
0	so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who
0	hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree
0	whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat 
0	to whom thus adam sore beset repli d 
0	o heav n in evil strait this day i stand
0	before my judge either to undergoe
0	my self the total crime or to accuse
0	my other self the partner of my life 
0	whose failing while her faith to me remaines 
0	i should conceal and not expose to blame
0	by my complaint but strict necessitie
0	subdues me and calamitous constraint 
0	least on my head both sin and punishment 
0	however insupportable be all
0	devolv d though should i hold my peace yet thou
0	wouldst easily detect what i conceale 
0	this woman whom thou mad st to be my help 
0	and gav st me as thy perfet gift so good 
0	so fit so acceptable so divine 
0	that from her hand i could suspect no ill 
0	and what she did whatever in it self 
0	her doing seem d to justifie the deed 
0	shee gave me of the tree and i did eate 
0	to whom the sovran presence thus repli d 
0	was shee thy god that her thou didst obey
0	before his voice or was shee made thy guide 
0	superior or but equal that to her
0	thou did st resigne thy manhood and the place
0	wherein god set thee above her made of thee 
0	and for thee whose perfection farr excell d
0	hers in all real dignitie adornd
0	she was indeed and lovely to attract
0	were such as under government well seem d 
0	unseemly to beare rule which was thy part
0	and person had st thou known thy self aright 
0	so having said he thus to eve in few 
0	say woman what is this which thou hast done 
0	to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm d 
0	confessing soon yet not before her judge
0	bold or loquacious thus abasht repli d 
0	the serpent me beguil d and i did eate 
0	which when the lord god heard without delay
0	to judgement he proceeded on th accus d
0	serpent though brute unable to transferre
0	the guilt on him who made him instrument
0	of mischief and polluted from the end
0	of his creation justly then accurst 
0	as vitiated in nature more to know
0	concern d not man since he no further knew 
0	nor alter d his offence yet god at last
0	to satan first in sin his doom apply d 
0	though in mysterious terms judg d as then best 
0	and on the serpent thus his curse let fall 
0	because thou hast done this thou art accurst
0	above all cattel each beast of the field 
0	upon thy belly groveling thou shalt goe 
0	and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life 
0	between thee and the woman i will put
0	enmitie and between thine and her seed 
0	her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel 
0	so spake this oracle then verifi d
0	when jesus son of mary second eve 
0	saw satan fall like lightning down from heav n 
0	prince of the aire then rising from his grave
0	spoild principalities and powers triumpht
0	in open shew and with ascention bright
0	captivity led captive through the aire 
0	the realme it self of satan long usurpt 
0	whom he shall tread at last under our feet 
0	eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise 
0	and to the woman thus his sentence turn d 
0	thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie
0	by thy conception children thou shalt bring
0	in sorrow forth and to thy husbands will
0	thine shall submit hee over thee shall rule 
0	on adam last thus judgement he pronounc d 
0	because thou hast heark nd to the voice of thy wife 
0	and eaten of the tree concerning which
0	i charg d thee saying thou shalt not eate thereof 
0	curs d is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
0	shalt eate thereof all the days of thy life 
0	thornes also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
0	unbid and thou shalt eate th herb of th field 
0	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread 
0	till thou return unto the ground for thou
0	out of the ground wast taken know thy birth 
0	for dust thou art and shalt to dust returne 
0	so judg d he man both judge and saviour sent 
0	and th instant stroke of death denounc t that day
0	remov d farr off then pittying how they stood
0	before him naked to the aire that now
0	must suffer change disdain d not to begin
0	thenceforth the forme of servant to assume 
0	as when he wash d his servants feet so now
0	as father of his familie he clad
0	thir nakedness with skins of beasts or slain 
0	or as the snake with youthful coate repaid 
0	and thought not much to cloath his enemies 
0	nor hee thir outward onely with the skins
0	of beasts but inward nakedness much more
0	opprobrious with his robe of righteousness 
0	araying cover d from his fathers sight 
0	to him with swift ascent he up returnd 
0	into his blissful bosom reassum d
0	in glory as of old to him appeas d
0	all though all knowing what had past with man
0	recounted mixing intercession sweet 
0	meanwhile ere thus was sin d and judg d on earth 
0	within the gates of hell sate sin and death 
0	in counterview within the gates that now
0	stood open wide belching outrageous flame
0	farr into chaos since the fiend pass d through 
0	sin opening who thus now to death began 
0	o son why sit we here each other viewing
0	idlely while satan our great author thrives
0	in other worlds and happier seat provides
0	for us his ofspring deare it cannot be
0	but that success attends him if mishap 
0	ere this he had return d with fury driv n
0	by his avenger since no place like this
0	can fit his punishment or their revenge 
0	methinks i feel new strength within me rise

0	for death from sin no power can separate 
0	but least the difficultie of passing back
0	stay his returne perhaps over this gulfe
0	impassable impervious let us try
0	adventrous work yet to thy power and mine
0	not unagreeable to found a path

0	where satan now prevailes a monument
0	of merit high to all th infernal host 
0	easing thir passage hence for intercourse

0	the glory of that glory who now becom

0	of god whom to behold was then my highth
0	of happiness yet well if here would end

0	shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound 
0	on mee as on thir natural center light
0	heavie though in thir place o fleeting joyes
0	of paradise deare bought with lasting woes 
0	did i request thee maker from my clay
0	to mould me man did i sollicite thee
0	from darkness to promote me or here place
0	in this delicious garden as my will
0	concurd not to my being it were but right
0	and equal to reduce me to my dust 
0	desirous to resigne and render back
0	all i receav d unable to performe
0	thy terms too hard by which i was to hold
0	the good i sought not to the loss of that 
0	sufficient penaltie why hast thou added
0	the sense of endless woes inexplicable
0	thy justice seems yet to say truth too late 
0	i thus contest then should have been refusd
0	those terms whatever when they were propos d 
0	thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good 
0	then cavil the conditions and though god
0	made thee without thy leave what if thy son
0	prove disobedient and reprov d retort 
0	wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not 
0	wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
0	that proud excuse yet him not thy election 
0	but natural necessity begot 
0	god made thee of choice his own and of his own
0	to serve him thy reward was of his grace 
0	thy punishment then justly is at his will 
0	be it so for i submit his doom is fair 
0	that dust i am and shall to dust returne 
0	o welcom hour whenever why delayes
0	his hand to execute what his decree
0	fixd on this day why do i overlive 
0	why am i mockt with death and length nd out
0	to deathless pain how gladly would i meet
0	mortalitie my sentence and be earth
0	insensible how glad would lay me down
0	as in my mothers lap there i should rest
0	and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
0	would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
0	to mee and to my ofspring would torment me
0	with cruel expectation yet one doubt
0	pursues me still least all i cannot die 
0	least that pure breath of life the spirit of man
0	which god inspir d cannot together perish
0	with this corporeal clod then in the grave 
0	or in some other dismal place who knows
0	but i shall die a living death o thought
0	horrid if true yet why it was but breath
0	of life that sinn d what dies but what had life
0	and sin the bodie properly hath neither 
0	all of me then shall die let this appease
0	the doubt since humane reach no further knows 
0	for though the lord of all be infinite 
0	is his wrauth also be it man is not so 
0	but mortal doom d how can he exercise
0	wrath without end on man whom death must end 
0	can he make deathless death that were to make
0	strange contradiction which to god himself
0	impossible is held as argument
0	of weakness not of power will he draw out 
0	for angers sake finite to infinite
0	in punisht man to satisfie his rigour
0	satisfi d never that were to extend
0	his sentence beyond dust and natures law 
0	by which all causes else according still
0	to the reception of thir matter act 
0	not to th extent of thir own spheare but say
0	that death be not one stroak as i suppos d 
0	bereaving sense but endless miserie
0	from this day onward which i feel begun
0	both in me and without me and so last
0	to perpetuitie ay me that fear
0	comes thundring back with dreadful revolution
0	on my defensless head both death and i
0	am found eternal and incorporate both 
0	nor i on my part single in mee all
0	posteritie stands curst fair patrimonie
0	that i must leave ye sons o were i able
0	to waste it all my self and leave ye none 
0	so disinherited how would ye bless
0	me now your curse ah why should all mankind
0	for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn d 
0	if guiltless but from mee what can proceed 
0	but all corrupt both mind and will deprav d 
0	not to do onely but to will the same
0	with me how can they acquitted stand
0	in sight of god him after all disputes
0	forc t i absolve all my evasions vain
0	and reasonings though through mazes lead me still
0	but to my own conviction first and last
0	on mee mee onely as the sourse and spring
0	of all corruption all the blame lights due 
0	so might the wrauth fond wish couldst thou support
0	that burden heavier then the earth to bear 
0	then all the world much heavier though divided
0	with that bad woman thus what thou desir st 
0	and what thou fearst alike destroyes all hope
0	of refuge and concludes thee miserable
0	beyond all past example and future 
0	to satan onely like both crime and doom 
0	o conscience into what abyss of fears
0	and horrors hast thou driv n me out of which
0	i find no way from deep to deeper plung d 
0	thus adam to himself lamented loud
0	through the still night now now as ere man fell 
0	wholsom and cool and mild but with black air
0	accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom 
0	which to his evil conscience represented
0	all things with double terror on the ground
0	outstretcht he lay on the cold ground and oft
0	curs d his creation death as oft accus d
0	the day of his offence why comes not death 
0	said hee with one thrice acceptable stroke
0	to end me shall truth fail to keep her word 
0	justice divine not hast n to be just 
0	but death comes not at call justice divine
0	mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries 
0	with other echo farr i taught your shades
0	to answer and resound farr other song 
0	whom thus afflicted when sad eve beheld 
0	desolate where she sate approaching nigh 
0	soft words to his fierce passion she assay d 
0	but her with stern regard he thus repell d 
0	out of my sight thou serpent that name best
0	befits thee with him leagu d thy self as false
0	and hateful nothing wants but that thy shape 
0	like his and colour serpentine may shew
0	thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
0	henceforth least that too heav nly form pretended
0	to hellish falshood snare them but for thee
0	i had persisted happie had not thy pride
0	and wandring vanitie when lest was safe 
0	rejected my forewarning and disdain d
0	not to be trusted longing to be seen
0	though by the devil himself him overweening
0	to over reach but with the serpent meeting
0	fool d and beguil d by him thou i by thee 
0	to trust thee from my side imagin d wise 
0	constant mature proof against all assaults 
0	and understood not all was but a shew
0	rather then solid vertu all but a rib
0	crooked by nature bent as now appears 
0	more to the part sinister from me drawn 
0	well if thrown out as supernumerarie
0	to my just number found o why did god 
0	creator wise that peopl d highest heav n
0	with spirits masculine create at last
0	this noveltie on earth this fair defect
0	of nature and not fill the world at once
0	with men as angels without feminine 
0	or find some other way to generate
0	mankind this mischief had not then befall n 
0	and more that shall befall innumerable
0	disturbances on earth through femal snares 
0	and straight conjunction with this sex for either
0	he never shall find out fit mate but such
0	as some misfortune brings him or mistake 
0	or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
0	through her perverseness but shall see her gaind
0	by a farr worse or if she love withheld
0	by parents or his happiest choice too late
0	shall meet alreadie linkt and wedlock bound

0	he added not and from her turn d but eve
0	not so repulst with tears that ceas d not flowing

0	as in our evils and of easier choice 
0	if care of our descent perplex us most 
0	which must be born to certain woe devourd
0	by death at last and miserable it is
0	to be to others cause of misery 
0	our own begotten and of our loines to bring

0	that after wretched life must be at last
0	food for so foule a monster in thy power
0	it lies yet ere conception to prevent

0	conversing looking loving to abstain
0	from loves due rites nuptial embraces sweet 
0	and with desire to languish without hope 
0	before the present object languishing
0	with like desire which would be miserie
0	and torment less then none of what we dread 
0	then both our selves and seed at once to free
0	from what we fear for both let us make short 
0	let us seek death or hee not found supply
0	with our own hands his office on our selves 
0	why stand we longer shivering under feares 
0	that shew no end but death and have the power

0	destruction with destruction to destroy 
0	she ended heer or vehement despaire
0	broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts

0	to better hopes his more attentive minde
0	labouring had rais d and thus to eve repli d 
0	eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
0	to argue in thee somthing more sublime
0	and excellent then what thy minde contemnes 
0	but self destruction therefore saught refutes
0	that excellence thought in thee and implies 
0	not thy contempt but anguish and regret
0	for loss of life and pleasure overlov d 
0	or if thou covet death as utmost end
0	of miserie so thinking to evade
0	the penaltie pronounc t doubt not but god
0	hath wiselier arm d his vengeful ire then so
0	to be forestall d much more i fear least death
0	so snatcht will not exempt us from the paine
0	we are by doom to pay rather such acts
0	of contumacie will provoke the highest
0	to make death in us live then let us seek

0	of atabalipa and yet unspoil d

0	call el dorado but to nobler sights
0	michael from adams eyes the filme remov d
0	which that false fruit that promis d clearer sight
0	had bred then purg d with euphrasie and rue
0	the visual nerve for he had much to see 
0	and from the well of life three drops instill d 
0	so deep the power of these ingredients pierc d 
0	eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight 
0	that adam now enforc t to close his eyes 
0	sunk down and all his spirits became intranst 
0	but him the gentle angel by the hand
0	soon rais d and his attention thus recall d 
0	adam now ope thine eyes and first behold

0	nor sinn d thy sin yet from that sin derive
0	corruption to bring forth more violent deeds 
0	his eyes he op nd and beheld a field

0	new reapt the other part sheep walks and foulds 
0	ith midst an altar as the land mark stood
0	rustic of grassie sord thither anon
0	a sweatie reaper from his tillage brought

0	much at that sight was adam in his heart

0	t whom michael thus hee also mov d repli d 
0	these two are brethren adam and to come
0	out of thy loyns th unjust the just hath slain 
0	for envie that his brothers offering found
0	from heav n acceptance but the bloodie fact
0	will be aveng d and th others faith approv d
0	loose no reward though here thou see him die 
0	rowling in dust and gore to which our sire 
0	alas both for the deed and for the cause 
0	but have i now seen death is this the way
0	i must return to native dust o sight
0	of terrour foul and ugly to behold 
0	horrid to think how horrible to feel 
0	to whom thus michael death thou hast seen
0	in his first shape on man but many shapes
0	of death and many are the wayes that lead
0	to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense
0	more terrible at th entrance then within 
0	some as thou saw st by violent stroke shall die 
0	by fire flood famin by intemperance more
0	in meats and drinks which on the earth shal bring
0	diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
0	before thee shall appear that thou mayst know
0	what miserie th inabstinence of eve
0	shall bring on men immediately a place
0	before his eyes appeard sad noysom dark 
0	a lazar house it seemd wherein were laid

0	convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs 
0	intestin stone and ulcer colic pangs

0	dire was the tossing deep the groans despair
0	tended the sick busiest from couch to couch

0	shook but delaid to strike though oft invok t
0	with vows as thir chief good and final hope 
0	sight so deform what heart of rock could long
0	drie ey d behold adam could not but wept 
0	though not of woman born compassion quell d
0	his best of man and gave him up to tears
0	a space till firmer thoughts restraind excess 
0	and scarce recovering words his plaint renew d 
0	o miserable mankind to what fall
0	degraded to what wretched state reserv d 
0	better end heer unborn why is life giv n
0	to be thus wrested from us rather why
0	obtruded on us thus who if we knew
0	what we receive would either not accept
0	life offer d or soon beg to lay it down 
0	glad to be so dismist in peace can thus
0	th image of god in man created once
0	so goodly and erect though faultie since 
0	to such unsightly sufferings be debas t
0	under inhuman pains why should not man 
0	retaining still divine similitude
0	in part from such deformities be free 
0	and for his makers image sake exempt 
0	thir makers image answerd michael then
0	forsook them when themselves they villifi d
0	to serve ungovern d appetite and took
0	his image whom they serv d a brutish vice 
0	inductive mainly to the sin of eve 
0	therefore so abject is thir punishment 
0	disfiguring not gods likeness but thir own 
0	or if his likeness by themselves defac t
0	while they pervert pure natures healthful rules
0	to loathsom sickness worthily since they
0	gods image did not reverence in themselves 
0	i yeild it just said adam and submit 
0	but is there yet no other way besides
0	these painful passages how we may come
0	to death and mix with our connatural dust 
0	there is said michael if thou well observe
0	the rule of not too much by temperance taught
0	in what thou eatst and drinkst seeking from thence
0	due nourishment not gluttonous delight 
0	till many years over thy head return 
0	so maist thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop
0	into thy mothers lap or be with ease
0	gatherd not harshly pluckt for death mature 
0	this is old age but then thou must outlive
0	thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change
0	to witherd weak gray thy senses then
0	obtuse all taste of pleasure must forgoe 
0	to what thou hast and for the aire of youth
0	hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reigne
0	a melancholly damp of cold and dry
0	to waigh thy spirits down and last consume
0	the balme of life to whom our ancestor 
0	henceforth i flie not death nor would prolong
0	life much bent rather how i may be quit
0	fairest and easiest of this combrous charge 
0	which i must keep till my appointed day
0	of rendring up michael to him repli d 
0	nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livst
0	live well how long or short permit to heav n 
0	and now prepare thee for another sight 
0	he lookd and saw a spacious plaine whereon
0	were tents of various hue by some were herds
0	of cattel grazing others whence the sound
0	of instruments that made melodious chime
0	was heard of harp and organ and who moovd
0	thir stops and chords was seen his volant touch
0	instinct through all proportions low and high
0	fled and pursu d transverse the resonant fugue 
0	in other part stood one who at the forge
0	labouring two massie clods of iron and brass
0	had melted whether found where casual fire
0	had wasted woods on mountain or in vale 
0	down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot
0	to som caves mouth or whether washt by stream
0	from underground the liquid ore he dreind
0	into fit moulds prepar d from which he formd
0	first his own tooles then what might else be wrought
0	fulfil or grav n in mettle after these 
0	but on the hether side a different sort
0	from the high neighbouring hills which was thir seat 
0	down to the plain descended by thir guise
0	just men they seemd and all thir study bent
0	to worship god aright and know his works
0	not hid nor those things lost which might preserve
0	freedom and peace to men they on the plain
0	long had not walkt when from the tents behold
0	a beavie of fair women richly gay
0	in gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung
0	soft amorous ditties and in dance came on 
0	the men though grave ey d them and let thir eyes
0	rove without rein till in the amorous net
0	fast caught they lik d and each his liking chose 
0	and now of love they treat till th eevning star
0	loves harbinger appeerd then all in heat
0	they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke
0	hymen then first to marriage rites invok t 
0	with feast and musick all the tents resound 
0	such happy interview and fair event
0	of love youth not lost songs garlands flours 
0	and charming symphonies attach d the heart
0	of adam soon enclin d to admit delight 
0	the bent of nature which he thus express d 
0	true opener of mine eyes prime angel blest 
0	much better seems this vision and more hope
0	of peaceful dayes portends then those two past 
0	those were of hate and death or pain much worse 
0	here nature seems fulfilld in all her ends 
0	to whom thus michael judg not what is best
0	by pleasure though to nature seeming meet 
0	created as thou art to nobler end
0	holie and pure conformitie divine 
0	those tents thou sawst so pleasant were the tents
0	of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race
0	who slew his brother studious they appere
0	of arts that polish life inventers rare 
0	unmindful of thir maker though his spirit
0	taught them but they his gifts acknowledg d none 
0	yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget 
0	for that fair femal troop thou sawst that seemd
0	of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay 
0	yet empty of all good wherein consists
0	womans domestic honour and chief praise 
0	bred onely and completed to the taste
0	of lustful apperence to sing to dance 
0	to dress and troule the tongue and roule the eye 
0	to these that sober race of men whose lives
0	religious titl d them the sons of god 
0	shall yeild up all thir vertue all thir fame
0	ignobly to the trains and to the smiles
0	of these fair atheists and now swim in joy 
0	 erelong to swim at larg and laugh for which
0	the world erelong a world of tears must weepe 
0	to whom thus adam of short joy bereft 
0	o pittie and shame that they who to live well
0	enterd so faire should turn aside to tread
0	paths indirect or in the mid way faint 
0	but still i see the tenor of mans woe
0	holds on the same from woman to begin 
0	from mans effeminate slackness it begins 
0	said th angel who should better hold his place
0	by wisdome and superiour gifts receavd 
0	but now prepare thee for another scene 
0	he lookd and saw wide territorie spred
0	before him towns and rural works between 
0	cities of men with lofty gates and towrs 
0	concours in arms fierce faces threatning warr 
0	giants of mightie bone and bould emprise

0	one way a band select from forage drives
0	a herd of beeves faire oxen and faire kine
0	from a fat meddow ground or fleecy flock 
0	ewes and thir bleating lambs over the plaine 
0	thir bootie scarce with life the shepherds flye 
0	but call in aide which tacks a bloody fray 
0	with cruel tournament the squadrons joine 
0	where cattel pastur d late now scatterd lies
0	with carcasses and arms th ensanguind field
0	deserted others to a citie strong
0	lay siege encampt by batterie scale and mine 
0	assaulting others from the wall defend
0	with dart and jav lin stones and sulfurous fire 
0	on each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds 
0	in other part the scepter d haralds call
0	to council in the citie gates anon
0	grey headed men and grave with warriours mixt 
0	assemble and harangues are heard but soon
0	in factious opposition till at last
0	of middle age one rising eminent
0	in wise deport spake much of right and wrong 
0	and judgement from above him old and young
0	exploded and had seiz d with violent hands 
0	had not a cloud descending snatch d him thence
0	unseen amid the throng so violence
0	through all the plain and refuge none was found 
0	adam was all in tears and to his guide
0	lamenting turnd full sad o what are these 
0	deaths ministers not men who thus deal death
0	inhumanly to men and multiply
0	ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew
0	his brother for of whom such massacher
0	make they but of thir brethren men of men 
0	but who was that just man whom had not heav n
0	rescu d had in his righteousness bin lost 
0	to whom thus michael these are the product
0	of those ill mated marriages thou saw st 
0	where good with bad were matcht who of themselves
0	abhor to joyn and by imprudence mixt 
0	produce prodigious births of bodie or mind 
0	such were these giants men of high renown 
0	for in those dayes might onely shall be admir d 
0	and valour and heroic vertu call d 
0	to overcome in battel and subdue

0	destroyers rightlier call d and plagues of men 
0	thus fame shall be achiev d renown on earth 
0	and what most merits fame in silence hid 
0	but hee the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst
0	the onely righteous in a world perverse 
0	and therefore hated therefore so beset
0	with foes for daring single to be just 
0	and utter odious truth that god would come
0	to judge them with his saints him the most high
0	rapt in a balmie cloud with winged steeds
0	did as thou sawst receave to walk with god
0	high in salvation and the climes of bliss 
0	exempt from death to shew thee what reward
0	awaits the good the rest what punishment 
0	which now direct thine eyes and soon behold 
0	he look d saw the face of things quite chang d 
0	the brazen throat of warr had ceast to roar 
0	all now was turn d to jollitie and game 
0	to luxurie and riot feast and dance 
0	marrying or prostituting as befell 
0	rape or adulterie where passing faire
0	allurd them thence from cups to civil broiles 
0	at length a reverend sire among them came 
0	and of thir doings great dislike declar d 
0	and testifi d against thir wayes hee oft
0	frequented thir assemblies whereso met 
0	triumphs or festivals and to them preachd
0	in prison under judgements imminent 
0	but all in vain which when he saw he ceas d
0	contending and remov d his tents farr off 
0	then from the mountain hewing timber tall 
0	began to build a vessel of huge bulk 
0	measur d by cubit length breadth and highth 
0	smeard round with pitch and in the side a dore
0	contriv d and of provisions laid in large
0	for man and beast when loe a wonder strange 
0	of everie beast and bird and insect small
0	came seavens and pairs and enterd in as taught
0	thir order last the sire and his three sons
0	with thir four wives and god made fast the dore 
0	meanwhile the southwind rose with black wings
0	wide hovering all the clouds together drove
0	from under heav n the hills to their supplie
0	vapour and exhalation dusk and moist 
0	sent up amain and now the thick nd skie
0	like a dark ceeling stood down rush d the rain
0	impetuous and continu d till the earth
0	no more was seen the floating vessel swum
0	uplifted and secure with beaked prow
0	rode tilting o re the waves all dwellings else

0	how didst thou grieve then adam to behold
0	the end of all thy ofspring end so sad 
0	depopulation thee another floud 
0	of tears and sorrow a floud thee also drown d 
0	and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reard
0	by th angel on thy feet thou stoodst at last 
0	though comfortless as when a father mourns
0	his childern all in view destroyd at once 
0	and scarce to th angel utterdst thus thy plaint 
0	o visions ill foreseen better had i
0	liv d ignorant of future so had borne
0	my part of evil onely each dayes lot
0	anough to bear those now that were dispenst
0	the burd n of many ages on me light
0	at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth
0	abortive to torment me ere thir being 
0	with thought that they must be let no man seek
0	henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
0	him or his childern evil he may be sure 
0	which neither his foreknowing can prevent 
0	and hee the future evil shall no less
0	in apprehension then in substance feel
0	grievous to bear but that care now is past 
0	man is not whom to warne those few escap t
0	famin and anguish will at last consume
0	wandring that watrie desert i had hope
0	when violence was ceas t and warr on earth 
0	all would have then gon well peace would have crownd
0	with length of happy days the race of man 
0	but i was farr deceav d for now i see
0	peace to corrupt no less then warr to waste 
0	how comes it thus unfould celestial guide 
0	and whether here the race of man will end 
0	to whom thus michael those whom last thou sawst
0	in triumph and luxurious wealth are they
0	first seen in acts of prowess eminent
0	and great exploits but of true vertu void 
0	who having spilt much blood and don much waste
0	subduing nations and achievd thereby
0	fame in the world high titles and rich prey 
0	shall change thir course to pleasure ease and sloth 
0	surfet and lust till wantonness and pride
0	raise out of friendship hostil deeds in peace 
0	the conquerd also and enslav d by warr
0	shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
0	and feare of god from whom thir pietie feign d
0	in sharp contest of battel found no aide
0	against invaders therefore coold in zeale
0	thenceforth shall practice how to live secure 
0	worldlie or dissolute on what thir lords
0	shall leave them to enjoy for th earth shall bear
0	more then anough that temperance may be tri d 
0	so all shall turn degenerate all deprav d 
0	justice and temperance truth and faith forgot 
0	one man except the onely son of light
0	in a dark age against example good 
0	against allurement custom and a world
0	offended fearless of reproach and scorn 
0	or violence hee of thir wicked wayes
0	shall them admonish and before them set
0	the paths of righteousness how much more safe 
0	and full of peace denouncing wrauth to come
0	on thir impenitence and shall returne
0	of them derided but of god observd
0	the one just man alive by his command
0	shall build a wondrous ark as thou beheldst 
0	to save himself and houshold from amidst
0	a world devote to universal rack 
0	no sooner hee with them of man and beast
0	select for life shall in the ark be lodg d 
0	and shelterd round but all the cataracts
0	of heav n set open on the earth shall powre
0	raine day and night all fountaines of the deep
0	broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp
0	beyond all bounds till inundation rise
0	above the highest hills then shall this mount
0	of paradise by might of waves be moovd
0	out of his place pushd by the horned floud 
0	with all his verdure spoil d and trees adrift
0	down the great river to the op ning gulf 
0	and there take root an iland salt and bare 
0	the haunt of seales and orcs and sea mews clang 
0	to teach thee that god attributes to place
0	no sanctitie if none be thither brought
0	by men who there frequent or therein dwell 
0	and now what further shall ensue behold 
0	he lookd and saw the ark hull on the floud 
0	which now abated for the clouds were fled 
0	drivn by a keen north winde that blowing drie
0	wrinkl d the face of deluge as decai d 
0	and the cleer sun on his wide watrie glass
0	gaz d hot and of the fresh wave largely drew 
0	as after thirst which made thir flowing shrink
0	from standing lake to tripping ebbe that stole
0	with soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt
0	his sluces as the heav n his windows shut 
0	the ark no more now flotes but seems on ground
0	fast on the top of som high mountain fixt 
0	and now the tops of hills as rocks appeer 
0	with clamor thence the rapid currents drive
0	towards the retreating sea thir furious tyde 
0	forthwith from out the arke a raven flies 
0	and after him the surer messenger 
0	a dove sent forth once and agen to spie
0	green tree or ground whereon his foot may light 
0	the second time returning in his bill
0	an olive leafe he brings pacific signe 
0	anon drie ground appeers and from his arke
0	the ancient sire descends with all his train 
0	then with uplifted hands and eyes devout 
0	grateful to heav n over his head beholds
0	a dewie cloud and in the cloud a bow
0	conspicuous with three lifted colours gay 
0	betok ning peace from god and cov nant new 
0	whereat the heart of adam erst so sad
0	greatly rejoyc d and thus his joy broke forth 
0	o thou that future things canst represent
0	as present heav nly instructer i revive
0	at this last sight assur d that man shall live
0	with all the creatures and thir seed preserve 
0	farr less i now lament for one whole world
0	of wicked sons destroyd then i rejoyce
0	for one man found so perfet and so just 
0	that god voutsafes to raise another world
0	from him and all his anger to forget 
0	but say what mean those colourd streaks in heavn 
0	distended as the brow of god appeas d 
0	or serve they as a flourie verge to binde
0	the fluid skirts of that same watrie cloud 
0	least it again dissolve and showr the earth 
0	to whom th archangel dextrously thou aim st 
0	so willingly doth god remit his ire 
0	though late repenting him of man deprav d 
0	griev d at his heart when looking down he saw
0	the whole earth fill d with violence and all flesh
0	corrupting each thir way yet those remoov d 
0	such grace shall one just man find in his sight 
0	that he relents not to blot out mankind 
0	and makes a covenant never to destroy
0	the earth again by flood nor let the sea
0	surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world
0	with man therein or beast but when he brings
0	over the earth a cloud will therein set
0	his triple colour d bow whereon to look
0	and call to mind his cov nant day and night 
0	seed time and harvest heat and hoary frost
0	shall hold thir course till fire purge all things new

0	my dissolution michael repli d 
0	though bent on speed so heer the archangel paus d
0	betwixt the world destroy d and world restor d 
0	if adam aught perhaps might interpose 
0	then with transition sweet new speech resumes 
0	thus thou hast seen one world begin and end 
0	and man as from a second stock proceed 
0	much thou hast yet to see but i perceave
0	thy mortal sight to faile objects divine
0	must needs impaire and wearie human sense 
0	henceforth what is to com i will relate

0	this second sours of men while yet but few 
0	and while the dread of judgement past remains
0	fresh in thir mindes fearing the deitie 
0	with some regard to what is just and right
0	shall lead thir lives and multiplie apace

0	shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam d and dwell
0	long time in peace by families and tribes
0	under paternal rule till one shall rise
0	of proud ambitious heart who not content
0	with fair equalitie fraternal state 
0	will arrogate dominion undeserv d

0	though of rebellion others he accuse

0	with him or under him to tyrannize 
0	marching from eden towards the west shall finde
0	the plain wherein a black bituminous gurge

0	unseen and through thir habitations walks
0	to mark thir doings them beholding soon 
0	comes down to see thir citie ere the tower
0	obstruct heav n towrs and in derision sets
0	upon thir tongues a various spirit to rase
0	quite out thir native language and instead
0	to sow a jangling noise of words unknown 
0	forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud

0	his day in whom all nations shall be blest 
0	favour unmerited by me who sought

0	this yet i apprehend not why to those
0	among whom god will deigne to dwell on earth
0	so many and so various laws are giv n 
0	so many laws argue so many sins
0	among them how can god with such reside 
0	to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin
0	will reign among them as of thee begot 
0	and therefore was law given them to evince
0	thir natural pravitie by stirring up
0	sin against law to fight that when they see
0	law can discover sin but not remove 
0	save by those shadowie expiations weak 
0	the bloud of bulls and goats they may conclude
0	some bloud more precious must be paid for man 
0	just for unjust that in such righteousness
0	to them by faith imputed they may finde
0	justification towards god and peace
0	of conscience which the law by ceremonies
0	cannot appease nor man the moral part
0	perform and not performing cannot live 
0	so law appears imperfet and but giv n
0	with purpose to resign them in full time
0	up to a better cov nant disciplin d
0	from shadowie types to truth from flesh to spirit 
0	from imposition of strict laws to free
0	acceptance of large grace from servil fear
0	to filial works of law to works of faith 
0	and therefore shall not moses though of god
0	highly belov d being but the minister
0	of law his people into canaan lead 
0	but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call 
0	his name and office bearing who shall quell
0	the adversarie serpent and bring back
0	through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man
0	safe to eternal paradise of rest 
0	meanwhile they in thir earthly canaan plac t
0	long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins
0	national interrupt thir public peace 
0	provoking god to raise them enemies 
0	from whom as oft he saves them penitent
0	by judges first then under kings of whom
0	the second both for pietie renownd

0	men who attend the altar and should most
0	endeavour peace thir strife pollution brings
0	upon the temple it self at last they seise

0	barr d of his right yet at his birth a starr
0	unseen before in heav n proclaims him com 
0	and guides the eastern sages who enquire

0	o prophet of glad tidings finisher

0	why our great expectation should be call d
0	the seed of woman virgin mother haile 
0	high in the love of heav n yet from my loynes
0	thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son
0	of god most high so god with man unites 
0	needs must the serpent now his capital bruise
0	expect with mortal paine say where and when
0	thir fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel 
0	to whom thus michael dream not of thir fight 
0	as of a duel or the local wounds
0	of head or heel not therefore joynes the son
0	manhood to god head with more strength to foil
0	thy enemie nor so is overcome
0	satan whose fall from heav n a deadlier bruise 
0	disabl d not to give thee thy deaths wound 
0	which hee who comes thy saviour shall recure 
0	not by destroying satan but his works
0	in thee and in thy seed nor can this be 
0	but by fulfilling that which thou didst want 
0	obedience to the law of god impos d
0	on penaltie of death and suffering death 
0	the penaltie to thy transgression due 
0	and due to theirs which out of thine will grow 
0	so onely can high justice rest appaid 
0	the law of god exact he shall fulfill
0	both by obedience and by love though love
0	alone fulfill the law thy punishment
0	he shall endure by coming in the flesh
0	to a reproachful life and cursed death 
0	proclaiming life to all who shall believe
0	in his redemption and that his obedience
0	imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
0	to save them not thir own though legal works 
0	for this he shall live hated be blasphem d 
0	seis d on by force judg d and to death condemnd
0	a shameful and accurst naild to the cross

0	but to the cross he nailes thy enemies 
0	the law that is against thee and the sins
0	of all mankinde with him there crucifi d 
0	never to hurt them more who rightly trust
0	in this his satisfaction so he dies 
0	but soon revives death over him no power
0	shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
0	returne the starres of morn shall see him rise
0	out of his grave fresh as the dawning light 
0	thy ransom paid which man from death redeems 
0	his death for man as many as offerd life
0	neglect not and the benefit imbrace
0	by faith not void of works this god like act
0	annuls thy doom the death thou shouldst have dy d 
0	in sin for ever lost from life this act
0	shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength
0	defeating sin and death his two maine armes 
0	and fix farr deeper in his head thir stings
0	then temporal death shall bruise the victors heel 
0	or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep 
0	a gentle wafting to immortal life 
0	nor after resurrection shall he stay
0	longer on earth then certaine times to appeer
0	still follow d him to them shall leave in charge
0	to teach all nations what of him they learn d
0	and his salvation them who shall beleeve
0	baptizing in the profluent streame the signe

0	all nations they shall teach for from that day
0	not onely to the sons of abrahams loines
0	salvation shall be preacht but to the sons
0	of abrahams faith wherever through the world 
0	so in his seed all nations shall be blest 
0	then to the heav n of heav ns he shall ascend
0	with victory triumphing through the aire
0	over his foes and thine there shall surprise
0	the serpent prince of aire and drag in chaines
0	through all his realme there confounded leave 
0	then enter into glory and resume
0	his seat at gods right hand exalted high
0	above all names in heav n and thence shall come 
0	when this worlds dissolution shall be ripe 
0	with glory and power to judge both quick dead 
0	to judge th unfaithful dead but to reward
0	his faithful and receave them into bliss 
0	whether in heav n or earth for then the earth
0	shall all be paradise far happier place
0	then this of eden and far happier daies 
0	so spake th archangel michael then paus d 
0	as at the worlds great period and our sire
0	replete with joy and wonder thus repli d 
0	o goodness infinite goodness immense 
0	that all this good of evil shall produce 
0	and evil turn to good more wonderful
0	then that which by creation first brought forth
0	light out of darkness full of doubt i stand 
0	whether i should repent me now of sin
0	by mee done and occasiond or rejoyce
0	much more that much more good thereof shall spring 
0	to god more glory more good will to men
0	from god and over wrauth grace shall abound 
0	but say if our deliverer up to heav n
0	must reascend what will betide the few
0	his faithful left among th unfaithful herd 
0	the enemies of truth who then shall guide
0	his people who defend will they not deale
0	wors with his followers then with him they dealt 
0	be sure they will said th angel but from heav n
0	hee to his own a comforter will send 
0	the promise of the father who shall dwell
0	his spirit within them and the law of faith
0	working through love upon thir hearts shall write 
0	to guide them in all truth and also arme
0	with spiritual armour able to resist
0	satans assaults and quench his fierie darts
0	what man can do against them not affraid 
0	though to the death against such cruelties
0	with inward consolations recompenc t 
0	and oft supported so as shall amaze
0	thir proudest persecuters for the spirit
0	powrd first on his apostles whom he sends
0	to evangelize the nations then on all
0	baptiz d shall them with wondrous gifts endue
0	to speak all tongues and do all miracles 
0	as did thir lord before them thus they win
0	great numbers of each nation to receave
0	with joy the tidings brought from heav n at length
0	thir ministry perform d and race well run 
0	thir doctrine and thir story written left 
0	they die but in thir room as they forewarne 
0	wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves 
0	who all the sacred mysteries of heav n
0	to thir own vile advantages shall turne
0	of lucre and ambition and the truth
0	with superstitions and traditions taint 
0	left onely in those written records pure 
0	though not but by the spirit understood 
0	then shall they seek to avail themselves of names 
0	places and titles and with these to joine
0	secular power though feigning still to act
0	by spiritual to themselves appropriating
0	the spirit of god promisd alike and giv n
0	to all beleevers and from that pretense 
0	spiritual lawes by carnal power shall force
0	on every conscience laws which none shall finde
0	left them inrould or what the spirit within
0	shall on the heart engrave what will they then
0	but force the spirit of grace it self and binde
0	his consort libertie what but unbuild
0	his living temples built by faith to stand 
0	thir own faith not anothers for on earth
0	who against faith and conscience can be heard
0	infallible yet many will presume 
0	whence heavie persecution shall arise
0	on all who in the worship persevere
0	of spirit and truth the rest farr greater part 
0	will deem in outward rites and specious formes
0	religion satisfi d truth shall retire
0	bestuck with slandrous darts and works of faith
0	rarely be found so shall the world goe on 
0	to good malignant to bad men benigne 
0	under her own waight groaning till the day
0	appeer of respiration to the just

0	of him so lately promis d to thy aid

0	measur d this transient world the race of time 
0	till time stand fixt beyond is all abyss 
0	eternitie whose end no eye can reach 
0	greatly instructed i shall hence depart 
0	greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
0	of knowledge what this vessel can containe 
0	beyond which was my folly to aspire 
0	henceforth i learne that to obey is best

0	merciful over all his works with good
0	still overcoming evil and by small

0	taught this by his example whom i now

1	 set up and electrotyped published october 
1	i swayed upon the gaudy stern
1	the butt end of a steering oar 
1	and everywhere that i could turn
1	men ran upon the shore 
1	and though i would have hushed the crowd
1	there was no mother s son but said 
1	 what is the figure in a shroud
1	upon a gaudy bed 
1	and fishes bubbling to the brim
1	cried out upon that thing beneath 
1	it had such dignity of limb 
1	by the sweet name of death 
1	though i d my finger on my lip 
1	what could i but take up the song 
1	and fish and crowd and gaudy ship
1	cried out the whole night long 
1	crying amid the glittering sea 
1	naming it with ecstatic breath 
1	because it had such dignity
1	by the sweet name of death 
1	if any man drew near
1	when i was young 
1	i thought he holds her dear 
1	and shook with hate and fear 
1	but oh twas bitter wrong
1	if he could pass her by
1	with an indifferent eye 
1	whereon i wrote and wrought 
1	and now being gray 
1	i dream that i have brought
1	to such a pitch my thought
1	that coming time can say 
1	 he shadowed in a glass
1	what thing her body was 
1	for she had fiery blood
1	when i was young 
1	and trod so sweetly proud
1	as twere upon a cloud 
1	a woman homer sung 
1	that life and letters seem
1	but an heroic dream 
1	she lived in storm and strife 
1	her soul had such desire
1	for what proud death may bring
1	that it could not endure
1	the common good of life 
1	but lived as twere a king
1	that packed his marriage day
1	with banneret and pennon 
1	trumpet and kettledrum 
1	and the outrageous cannon 
1	to bundle time away
1	that the night come 
1	i had this thought awhile ago 
1	 my darling cannot understand
1	what i have done or what would do
1	in this blind bitter land 
1	and i grew weary of the sun
1	until my thoughts cleared up again 
1	remembering that the best i have done
1	was done to make it plain 
1	that every year i have cried at length
1	my darling understands it all 
1	because i have come into my strength 
1	and words obey my call 
1	that had she done so who can say
1	what would have shaken from the sieve 
1	i might have thrown poor words away
1	and been content to live 
1	now must i these three praise 
1	three women that have wrought
1	what joy is in my days 
1	one that no passing thought 
1	nor those unpassing cares 
1	no not in these fifteen
1	many times troubled years 
1	could ever come between
1	heart and delighted heart 
1	and one because her hand
1	had strength that could unbind
1	what none can understand 
1	what none can have and thrive 
1	youth s dreamy load till she
1	so changed me that i live
1	labouring in ecstasy 
1	and what of her that took
1	all till my youth was gone
1	with scarce a pitying look 
1	how should i praise that one 
1	when day begins to break
1	i count my good and bad 
1	being wakeful for her sake 
1	remembering what she had 
1	what eagle look still shows 
1	while up from my heart s root
1	so great a sweetness flows
1	i shake from head to foot 
1	why should i blame her that she filled my days
1	with misery or that she would of late
1	have taught to ignorant men most violent ways 
1	or hurled the little streets upon the great 
1	had they but courage equal to desire 
1	what could have made her peaceful with a mind
1	that nobleness made simple as a fire 
1	with beauty like a tightened bow a kind
1	that is not natural in an age like this 
1	being high and solitary and most stern 
1	why what could she have done being what she is 
1	was there another troy for her to burn 
1	some may have blamed you that you took away
1	the verses that could move them on the day
1	when the ears being deafened the sight of the eyes blind
1	with lightning you went from me and i could find
1	nothing to make a song about but kings 
1	helmets and swords and half forgotten things
1	that were like memories of you but now
1	we ll out for the world lives as long ago 
1	and while we re in our laughing weeping fit 
1	hurl helmets crowns and swords into the pit 
1	but dear cling close to me since you were gone 
1	my barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone 
1	 would it were anything but merely voice 
1	the no king cried who after that was king 
1	because he had not heard of anything
1	that balanced with a word is more than noise 
1	yet old romance being kind let him prevail
1	somewhere or somehow that i have forgot 
1	though he d but cannon whereas we that had thought
1	to have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
1	have been defeated by that pledge you gave
1	in momentary anger long ago 
1	and i that have not your faith how shall i know
1	that in the blinding light beyond the grave
1	we ll find so good a thing as that we have lost 
1	the hourly kindness the day s common speech 
1	the habitual content of each with each
1	when neither soul nor body has been crossed 
1	suddenly i saw the cold and rook delighting heaven
1	that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice 
1	and thereupon imagination and heart were driven
1	so wild that every casual thought of that and this
1	vanished and left but memories that should be out of season
1	with the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago 
1	and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason 
1	until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro 
1	riddled with light ah when the ghost begins to quicken 
1	confusion of the death bed over is it sent
1	out naked on the roads as the books say and stricken
1	by the injustice of the skies for punishment 
1	ah that time could touch a form
1	that could show what homer s age
1	bred to be a hero s wage 
1	 were not all her life but storm 
1	would not painters paint a form
1	of such noble lines i said 
1	 such a delicate high head 
1	so much sternness and such charm 
1	till they had changed us to like strength 
1	ah but peace that comes at length 
1	came when time had touched her form 
1	o heart be at peace because
1	nor knave nor dolt can break
1	what s not for their applause 
1	being for a woman s sake 
1	enough if the work has seemed 
1	so did she your strength renew 
1	a dream that a lion had dreamed
1	till the wilderness cried aloud 
1	a secret between you two 
1	between the proud and the proud 
1	what still you would have their praise 
1	but here s a haughtier text 
1	the labyrinth of her days
1	that her own strangeness perplexed 
1	and how what her dreaming gave
1	earned slander ingratitude 
1	from self same dolt and knave 
1	aye and worse wrong than these 
1	yet she singing upon her road 
1	half lion half child is at peace 
1	the fascination of what s difficult
1	has dried the sap out of my veins and rent
1	spontaneous joy and natural content
1	out of my heart there s something ails our colt
1	that must as if it had not holy blood 
1	nor on an olympus leaped from cloud to cloud 
1	 all rights reserved 
1	shiver under the lash strain sweat and jolt
1	as though it dragged road metal my curse on plays
1	that have to be set up in fifty ways 
1	on the day s war with every knave and dolt 
1	theatre business management of men 
1	i swear before the dawn comes round again
1	i ll find the stable and pull out the bolt 
1	wine comes in at the mouth
1	and love comes in at the eye 
1	that s all we shall know for truth
1	before we grow old and die 
1	i lift the glass to my mouth 
1	i look at you and i sigh 
1	though leaves are many the root is one 
1	through all the lying days of my youth
1	i swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun 
1	now i may wither into the truth 
1	where where but here have pride and truth 
1	that long to give themselves for wage 
1	to shake their wicked sides at youth
1	restraining reckless middle age 
1	you say as i have often given tongue
1	in praise of what another s said or sung 
1	 twere politic to do the like by these 
1	but where s the wild dog that has praised his fleas 
1	once when midnight smote the air 
1	eunuchs ran through hell and met
1	round about hell s gate to stare
1	at great juan riding by 
1	and like these to rail and sweat 
1	maddened by that sinewy thigh 
1	 put off that mask of burning gold
1	with emerald eyes 
1	 o no my dear you make so bold
1	to find if hearts be wild and wise 
1	and yet not cold 
1	 i would but find what s there to find 
1	love or deceit 
1	 it was the mask engaged your mind 
1	and after set your heart to beat 
1	not what s behind 
1	 but lest you are my enemy 
1	i must enquire 
1	 o no my dear let all that be 
1	what matter so there is but fire
1	in you in me 
1	how should the world be luckier if this house 
1	where passion and precision have been one
1	time out of mind became too ruinous
1	to breed the lidless eye that loves the sun 
1	and the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow
1	where wings have memory of wings and all
1	that comes of the best knit to the best although
1	mean roof trees were the sturdier for its fall 
1	how should their luck run high enough to reach
1	the gifts that govern men and after these
1	to gradual time s last gift a written speech
1	wrought of high laughter loveliness and ease 
1	 imitated from ronsard 
1	dear craoibhin aoibhin look into our case 
1	when we are high and airy hundreds say
1	that if we hold that flight they ll leave the place 
1	while those same hundreds mock another day
1	because we have made our art of common things 
1	so bitterly you d dream they longed to look
1	all their lives through into some drift of wings 
1	you ve dandled them and fed them from the book
1	and know them to the bone impart to us 
1	we ll keep the secret a new trick to please 
1	is there a bridle for this proteus
1	that turns and changes like his draughty seas 
1	or is there none most popular of men 
1	but when they mock us that we mock again 
1	these are the clouds about the fallen sun 
1	the majesty that shuts his burning eye 
1	the weak lay hand on what the strong has done 
1	till that be tumbled that was lifted high
1	and discord follow upon unison 
1	and all things at one common level lie 
1	and therefore friend if your great race were run
1	and these things came so much the more thereby
1	have you made greatness your companion 
1	although it be for children that you sigh 
1	these are the clouds about the fallen sun 
1	the majesty that shuts his burning eye 
1	out yonder where the race course is 
1	delight makes all of the one mind 
1	riders upon the swift horses 
1	the field that closes in behind 
1	we too had good attendance once 
1	hearers and hearteners of the work 
1	aye horsemen for companions 
1	before the merchant and the clerk
1	breathed on the world with timid breath 
1	sing on sometime and at some new moon 
1	we ll learn that sleeping is not death 
1	hearing the whole earth change its tune 
1	its flesh being wild and it again
1	crying aloud as the race course is 
1	and we find hearteners among men
1	that ride upon horses 
1	sickness brought me this
1	thought in that scale of his 
1	why should i be dismayed
1	though flame had burned the whole
1	world as it were a coal 
1	now i have seen it weighed
1	against a soul 
1	all things can tempt me from this craft of verse 
1	one time it was a woman s face or worse 
1	the seeming needs of my fool driven land 
1	now nothing but comes readier to the hand
1	than this accustomed toil when i was young 
1	i had not given a penny for a song
1	did not the poet sing it with such airs
1	that one believed he had a sword upstairs 
1	yet would be now could i but have my wish 
1	i whispered i am too young 
1	and then i am old enough 
1	wherefore i threw a penny
1	to find out if i might love 
1	 go and love go and love young man 
1	if the lady be young and fair 
1	ah penny brown penny brown penny 
1	i am looped in the loops of her hair 
1	oh love is the crooked thing 
1	there is nobody wise enough
1	to find out all that is in it 
1	for he would be thinking of love
1	till the stars had run away 
1	and the shadows eaten the moon 
1	ah penny brown penny brown penny 
1	one cannot begin it too soon

1	 at the abbey theatre the house is orange red and the chairs and
1	tables and flagons black with a slight purple tinge which is not
1	characters except the red man and the black men are dressed in
1	various shades of green one or two with touches of purple which
1	a cat headed man out of connaught go pacing and spitting by 
1	but that could not be 
1	you have dreamed it there s nothing out there 
1	and then i danced on their graves and carried away their hoard 
1	does anything stir on the sea 
1	not even a fish or a gull 
1	i can see for a mile or two now that the moon s at the full 
1	ah there there is someone who calls us 
1	but from the landward side 
1	and we have nothing to fear that has not come up from the tide 
1	the rocks and the bushes cover whoever made that noise 
1	but the land will do us no harm 
1	it was like cuchulain s voice 
1	but that s an impossible thing 
1	an impossible thing indeed 
1	for he will never come home he has all that he could need
1	in that high windy scotland good luck in all that he does 
1	here neighbour wars on neighbour and why there is no man knows 
1	and if a man is lucky all wish his luck away 
1	and take his good name from him between a day and a day 
1	i would he d come for all that and make his young wife know
1	that though she may be his wife she has no right to go
1	before your wife and my wife as she would have gone last night
1	had they not caught at her dress and pulled her as was right 
1	and she makes light of us though our wives do all that they can 
1	she spreads her tail like a peacock and praises none but her man 
1	a man in a long green cloak that covers him up to the chin
1	comes down through the rocks and hazels 
1	cry out that he cannot come in 
1	no man on the ridge of the world must ever know that but us two 
1	go away go away go away 
1	i will go when the night is through
1	and i have eaten and slept and drunk to my heart s delight 
1	a law has been made that none shall sleep in this house to night 
1	who made that law 
1	we made it and who has so good a right 
1	who else has to keep the house from the shape changers till day 
1	then i will unmake the law so get you out of the way 
1	i thought that no living man could have pushed me from the door 
1	nor could any living man do it but for the dip in the floor 
1	and had i been rightly ready there s no man living could do it 
1	dip or no dip 
1	go out if you have your wits go out 
1	a stone s throw further on you will find a big house where
1	our wives will give you supper and you ll sleep sounder there 
1	for it s a luckier house 
1	i ll eat and sleep where i will 
1	go out or i will make you 
1	not till i have drunk my fill 
1	but may some dog defend me for a cat of wonder s up 
1	laegaire and conall are here the flagon full to the top 
1	and the cups 
1	the cups are dry as a bone 
1	go into scotland again or where you will but begone
1	from this unlucky country that was made when the devil spat 
1	i am losing patience conall i find you stuffed with pride 
1	the flagon full to the brim the front door standing wide 
1	you d put me off with words but the whole thing s plain enough 
1	you are waiting for some message to bring you to war or love
1	in that old secret country beyond the wool white waves 
1	or it may be down beneath them in foam bewildered caves
1	where nine forsaken sea queens fling shuttles to and fro 
1	but beyond them or beneath them whether you will or no 
1	i am going too 
1	better tell it all out to the end 
1	he was born to luck in the cradle his good luck may amend
1	the bad luck we were born to 
1	i ll lay the whole thing bare 
1	you saw the luck that he had when he pushed in past me there 
1	does anything stir on the sea 
1	not even a fish or a gull 
1	when a wide high man came in with a red foxy cloak 
1	with half shut foxy eyes and a great laughing mouth 
1	and he said when we bid him drink that he had so great a drouth
1	he could drink the sea 
1	i thought he had come from one of you
1	out of some connaught rath and would lap up milk and mew 
1	but if he so loved water i have the tale awry 
1	you would not be so merry if he were standing by 
1	for when we had sung or danced as he were our next of kin
1	he promised to show us a game the best that ever had been 
1	 a head for a head he said that is the game that i play 
1	how could he whip off a head when his own had been whipped away 
1	we told him it over and over and that ale had fuddled his wit 
1	and there on the ground where it fell it went on laughing at me 
1	till he took it up in his hands 
1	and splashed himself into the sea 
1	i have imagined as good when i ve been as deep in the cup 
1	you never did 
1	and believed it 
1	cuchulain when will you stop
1	boasting of your great deeds and weighing yourself with us two 
1	and crying out to the world whatever we say or do 
1	that you ve said or done a better nor is it a drunkard s tale 
1	swore we should keep it secret 
1	but twelve months upon the clock 
1	a twelvemonth from the first time 
1	and the jug full up to the brim 
1	for we had been put from our drinking by the very thought of him 
1	we stood as we re standing now 
1	the horns were as empty 
1	he ran up out of the sea with his head on his shoulders again 
1	why this is a tale worth telling 
1	and he called for his debt and his right 
1	what is there to be said
1	when a man with a right to get it has come to ask for your head 
1	if you had been sitting there you had been silent like us 
1	he would have followed after if we had run away 
1	will he tell every mother s son that we have broken our word 
1	whether he does or does not we ll drive him out with the sword 
1	and take his life in the bargain if he but dare to scoff 
1	or a man that can pick it up and carry it out in his hand 
1	he is coming now there s a splash and a rumble along the strand
1	as when he came last 
1	come and put all your backs to the door 
1	it is too late to shut it for there he stands once more
1	and laughs like the sea 
1	old herring you whip off heads why then
1	whip off your own for it seems you can clap it on again 
1	or else go down in the sea go down in the sea i say 
1	find that old juggler manannan and whip his head away 
1	or the red man of the boyne for they are of your own sort 
1	or if the waves have vexed you and you would find a sport
1	of a more irish fashion go fight without a rest
1	a caterwauling phantom among the winds of the west 
1	but what are you waiting for into the water i say 
1	if there s no sword can harm you i ve an older trick to play 
1	an old five fingered trick to tumble you out of the place 
1	i am sualtim s son cuchulain what do you laugh in my face 
1	so you too think me in earnest in wagering poll for poll 
1	a drinking joke and a gibe and a juggler s feat that is all 
1	to make the time go quickly for i am the drinker s friend 
1	the kindest of all shape changers from here to the world s end 
1	the best of all tipsy companions and now i bring you a gift 
1	and wear upon his own head and choose for yourselves the best 
1	there i m forgiven now 
1	let the bravest take it up 
1	laegaire is best 
1	between water and hill 
1	he fought in the west
1	with cat heads until
1	at the break of day
1	all fell by his sword 
1	and he carried away
1	their hidden hoard 
1	give it me for what did you find in the bag
1	but the straw and the broken delf and the bits of dirty rag
1	you d taken for good money 
1	no no but give it me 
1	the helmet s mine or laegaire s you re the youngest of us three 
1	i did not take it to keep it the red man gave it for one 
1	but i shall give it to all to all of us three or to none 
1	that is as you look upon it we will pass it to and fro 
1	and time and time about drink out of it and so
1	stroke into peace this cat that has come to take our lives 
1	now it is purring again and now i drink to your wives 
1	and i drink to emer my wife 
1	why what in god s name is that noise 
1	what else but the charioteers and the kitchen and stable boys
1	shouting against each other and the worst of all is your own 
1	that chariot driver laeg and they ll keep it up till the dawn 
1	there do you hear them now such hatred has each for each
1	they have taken the hunting horns to drown one other s speech
1	they carry great horns ladles and the like 
1	i am laeg cuchulain s driver and my master s cock of the yard 
1	conall would scatter his feathers 
1	no use they won t hear a word 
1	they ll keep it up till the dawn 
1	it is laegaire that is the best 
1	for he fought with cats in connaught while conall took his rest
1	and drained his ale pot 
1	laegaire what does a man of his sort
1	care for the like of us he did it for his own sport 
1	it was all mere luck at the best 
1	but conall i say 
1	let me speak 
1	before your cock was born my master was in the fight 
1	conall has got it the best man has got it and i am his man 
1	who was it started this quarrel 
1	it was laeg done it all 
1	a high wide foxy man came where we sat in the hall 
1	getting our supper ready with a great voice like the wind 
1	and cried that there was a helmet or something of the kind 
1	that was for the foremost man upon the ridge of the earth 
1	so i cried your name through the hall 
1	but they denied its worth 
1	preferring laegaire or conall and they cried to drown my voice 
1	but i have so strong a throat that i drowned all their noise
1	till they took to the hunting horns and blew them into my face 
1	no conall is the best man here 
1	give it to laegaire that made the murderous cats pay dear 
1	it has been given to none that our rivalry might cease 
1	we have turned that murderous cat into a cup of peace 
1	i drank the first and then conall give it to laegaire now 
1	that it may purr in his hand and all of our servants know
1	that since the ale went in its claws went out of sight 
1	that s well i will stop my shouting 
1	cuchulain is in the right 
1	i am tired of this big horn that has made me hoarse as a rook 
1	cuchulain you drank the first 
1	by drinking the first he took
1	the whole of the honours himself 
1	cuchulain you drank the first 
1	if laegaire drink from it now he claims to be last and worst 
1	cuchulain and conall have drunk 
1	he is lost if he taste a drop 
1	that juggler from the sea that old red herring it is
1	who has set us all by the ears he brought the helmet for this 
1	and because we would not quarrel he ran elsewhere to shout
1	that conall and laegaire wronged me till all had fallen out 
1	who knows where he is now or who he is spurring to fight 
1	so get you gone and whatever may cry aloud in the night 
1	or show itself in the air be silent until morn 
1	cuchulain is in the right i am tired of this big horn 
1	mine is the better to look at 
1	but mine is better born 
1	my man is the pithier man 
1	old hurricane well done 
1	you ve set our wives to the game that they may egg us on 
1	we are to kill each other that you may sport with us 
1	no i have the right of place for i married the better man 
1	my nails in your neck and shoulder 
1	and go before me if you can 
1	my husband fought in the west 
1	but what did he fight with there
1	but sidelong and spitting and helpless shadows of the dim air 
1	and what did he carry away but straw and broken delf 
1	your own man made up that tale trembling alone by himself 
1	drowning his terror 
1	i am emer it is i go first through the door 
1	no one shall walk before me or praise any man before
1	my man has been praised 
1	come put an end to their quarrelling 
1	one is as fair as the other and each one the wife of a king 
1	break down the painted boards between the sill and the floor
1	that they come in together each one at her own door 
1	nothing that he has done 
1	his mind that is fire 
1	his body that is sun 
1	have set my head higher
1	than all the world s wives 
1	himself on the wind
1	is the gift that he gives 
1	therefore womenkind 
1	when their eyes have met mine 
1	grow cold and grow hot 
1	troubled as with wine
1	by a secret thought 
1	preyed upon fed upon
1	by jealousy and desire 
1	i am moon to that sun 
1	i am steel to that fire 
1	spear from the door and the three women come in at the same
1	cuchulain put off this sloth and awake 
1	a share of your honour 
1	you lie for your man would take from my man 
1	you say that you double face and your own husband began 
1	town land may rail at town land till all have gone to wrack 
1	the very straws may wrangle till they ve thrown down the stack 
1	the very door posts bicker till they ve pulled in the door 
1	the very ale jars jostle till the ale is on the floor 
1	but this shall help no further 
1	it was not for your head 
1	and so you would let none wear it but fling it away instead 
1	but you shall answer for it for you ve robbed my man by this 
1	you have robbed us both cuchulain 
1	the greatest wrong there is
1	on the wide ridge of the world has been done to us two this day 
1	who is for cuchulain i say 
1	deafen her singing with horns 
1	cry aloud blow horns make a noise 
1	blow horns clap hands or shout so that you smother her voice 
1	themselves there is a deafening noise and a confused fight 
1	coal black and headed like cats they came up over the strand 
1	and i saw one stretch to a torch and cover it with his hand 
1	another sooty fellow has plucked the moon from the air 
1	great sword 
1	i demand the debt that s owing let some man kneel down there
1	that i may cut his head off or all shall go to wrack 
1	so i will give him my head 
1	little wife little wife be at rest 
1	alive i have been far off in all lands under sun 
1	and been no faithful man but when my story is done
1	my fame shall spring up and laugh and set you high above all 
1	it is you not your fame that i love 
1	you are young you are wise you can call
1	some kinder and comelier man that will sit at home in the house 
1	live and be faithless still 
1	would you stay the great barnacle goose
1	i too on the grey wing s path 
1	do you dare do you dare do you dare 
1	bear children and sweep the house 
1	wail but keep from the road 
1	i have not come for your hurt i m the rector of this land 
1	and with my spitting cat heads my frenzied moon bred band 
1	age after age i sift it and choose for its championship
1	the man who hits my fancy 
1	and i choose the laughing lip
1	that shall not turn from laughing whatever rise or fall 
1	the heart that grows no bitterer although betrayed by all 
1	the hand that loves to scatter the life like a gambler s throw 
1	and these things i make prosper till a day come that i know 
1	thoughts upon the present state of the world
1	a new end for the king s threshold 
1	note on the new end to the king s threshold 
1	 tis all souls night and the great christ church bell 
1	and many a lesser bell sound through the room 
1	for it is now midnight 
1	and two long glasses brimmed with muscatel
1	bubble upon the table a ghost may come 
1	for it is a ghost s right 
1	his element is so fine
1	being sharpened by his death 
1	to drink from the wine breath
1	while our gross palates drink from the whole wine 
1	i need some mind that if the cannon sound
1	from every quarter of the world can stay
1	wound in mind s pondering 
1	as mummies in the mummy cloth are wound 
1	because i have a marvellous thing to say 
1	a certain marvellous thing
1	none but the living mock 
1	though not for sober ear 
1	it may be all that hear
1	should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock 
1	h s the first i call he loved strange thought
1	and knew that sweet extremity of pride
1	that s called platonic love 
1	and that to such a pitch of passion wrought
1	nothing could bring him when his lady died 
1	anodyne for his love 
1	words were but wasted breath 
1	one dear hope had he 
1	the inclemency
1	of that or the next winter would be death 
1	two thoughts were so mixed up i could not tell
1	whether of her or god he thought the most 
1	but think that his mind s eye 
1	when upward turned on one sole image fell 
1	and that a slight companionable ghost 
1	wild with divinity 
1	had so lit up the whole
1	immense miraculous house 
1	the bible promised us 
1	it seemed a gold fish swimming in a bowl 
1	on florence emery i call the next 
1	who finding the first wrinkles on a face
1	admired and beautiful 
1	and knowing that the future would be vexed
1	with minished beauty multiplied commonplace 
1	preferred to teach a school 
1	away from neighbour or friend
1	among dark skins and there
1	permit foul years to wear
1	hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end 
1	before that end much had she ravelled out
1	from a discourse in figurative speech
1	by some learned indian
1	on the soul s journey how it is whirled about 
1	wherever the orbit of the moon can reach 
1	until it plunged into the sun 
1	and there free and yet fast 
1	being both chance and choice 
1	forget its broken toys
1	and sink into its own delight at last 
1	and i call up macgregor from the grave 
1	for in my first hard springtime we were friends 
1	although of late estranged 
1	and told him so but friendship never ends 
1	and what if mind seem changed 
1	and it seem changed with the mind 
1	when thoughts rise up unbid
1	on generous things that he did
1	and i grow half contented to be blind 
1	he had much industry at setting out 
1	much boisterous courage before loneliness
1	had driven him crazed 
1	for meditations upon unknown thought
1	make human intercourse grow less and less 
1	they are neither paid nor praised 
1	but he d object to the host 
1	the glass because my glass 
1	a ghost lover he was
1	and may have grown more arrogant being a ghost 
1	but names are nothing what matter who it be 
1	so that his elements have grown so fine
1	the fume of muscatel
1	can give his sharpened palate ecstasy
1	no living man can drink from the whole wine 
1	i have mummy truths to tell
1	whereat the living mock 
1	though not for sober ear 
1	for maybe all that hear
1	should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock 
1	such thought such thought have i that hold it tight
1	till meditation master all its parts 
1	nothing can stay my glance
1	until that glance run in the world s despite
1	to where the damned have howled away their hearts 
1	and where the blessed dance 
1	such thought that in it bound
1	i need no other thing
1	wound in mind s wandering 
1	as mummies in the mummy cloth are wound 
1	your hooves have stamped at the black margin of the wood 
1	even where the horrible green parrots call and swing 
1	my works are all stamped down into the sultry mud 
1	i knew that horse play knew it for a murderous thing 
1	what wholesome sun has ripened is wholesome food to eat
1	because of some green wing gathered old mummy wheat
1	in the mad abstract dark and ground it grain by grain
1	and after baked it slowly in an oven but now
1	i bring full flavoured wine out of a barrel found
1	where seven ephesian topers slept and never knew
1	when alexander s empire past they slept so sound 
1	stretch out your limbs and sleep a long saturnian sleep 
1	i have loved you better than my soul for all my words 
1	and there is none so fit to keep a watch and keep
1	unwearied eyes upon those horrible green birds 
1	many ingenious lovely things are gone
1	that seemed sheer miracle to the multitude 
1	above the murderous treachery of the moon
1	or all that wayward ebb and flow there stood
1	amid the ornamental bronze and stone
1	an ancient image made of olive wood 
1	and gone are phidias carven ivories
1	and all his golden grasshoppers and bees 
1	we too had many pretty toys when young 
1	a law indifferent to blame or praise
1	to bribe or threat habits that made old wrong
1	melt down as it were wax in the sun s rays 
1	public opinion ripening for so long
1	we thought it would outlive all future days 
1	o what fine thought we had because we thought
1	that the worst rogues and rascals had died out 
1	all teeth were drawn all ancient tricks unlearned 
1	and a great army but a showy thing 
1	what matter that no cannon had been turned
1	into a ploughshare parliament and king
1	thought that unless a little powder burned
1	the trumpeters might burst with trumpeting
1	and yet it lack all glory and perchance
1	the guardsmen s drowsy chargers would not prance 
1	now days are dragon ridden the nightmare
1	rides upon sleep a drunken soldiery
1	can leave the mother murdered at her door 
1	to crawl in her own blood and go scot free 
1	the night can sweat with terror as before
1	we pieced our thoughts into philosophy 
1	and planned to bring the world under a rule
1	who are but weasels fighting in a hole 
1	he who can read the signs nor sink unmanned
1	into the half deceit of some intoxicant
1	from shallow wits who knows no work can stand 
1	whether health wealth or peace of mind were spent
1	on master work of intellect or hand 
1	no honour leave its mighty monument 
1	has but one comfort left all triumph would
1	but break upon his ghostly solitude 
1	and other comfort were a bitter wound 
1	to be in love and love what vanishes 
1	greeks were but lovers all that country round
1	none dared admit if such a thought were his 
1	incendiary or bigot could be found
1	to burn that stump on the acropolis 
1	or break in bits the famous ivories
1	or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees 
1	when loie fuller s chinese dancers enwound
1	a shining web a floating ribbon of cloth 
1	it seemed that a dragon of air
1	had fallen among dancers had whirled them round
1	or hurried them off on its own furious path 
1	so the platonic year
1	whirls out new right and wrong
1	whirls in the old instead 
1	all men are dancers and their tread
1	goes to the barbarous clangour of gong 
1	some moralist or mythological poet
1	compares the solitary soul to a swan 
1	i am content with that 
1	contented that a troubled mirror show it
1	before that brief gleam of its life be gone 
1	an image of its state 
1	the wings half spread for flight 
1	the breast thrust out in pride
1	whether to play or to ride
1	those winds that clamour of approaching night 
1	a man in his own secret meditation
1	is lost amid the labyrinth that he has made
1	in art or politics 
1	some platonist affirms that in the station
1	where we should cast off body and trade
1	the ancient habit sticks 
1	and that if our works could
1	but vanish with our breath
1	that were a lucky death 
1	for triumph can but mar our solitude 
1	the swan has leaped into the desolate heaven 
1	that image can bring wildness bring a rage
1	to end all things to end
1	what my laborious life imagined even
1	the half imagined the half written page 
1	o but we dreamed to mend
1	whatever mischief seemed
1	to afflict mankind but now
1	that winds of winter blow
1	learn that we were crack pated when we dreamed 
1	we who seven years ago
1	talked of honour and of truth 
1	shriek with pleasure if we show
1	the weasel s twist the weasel s tooth 
1	come let us mock at the great
1	that had such burdens on the mind
1	and toiled so hard and late
1	to leave some monument behind 
1	nor thought of the levelling wind 
1	come let us mock at the wise 
1	with all those calendars whereon
1	they fixed old aching eyes 
1	they never saw how seasons run 
1	and now but gape at the sun 
1	come let us mock at the good
1	that fancied goodness might be gay 
1	grown tired of their solitude 
1	upon some brand new happy day 
1	wind shrieked and where are they 
1	mock mockers after that
1	that would not lift a hand maybe
1	to help good wise or great
1	to bar that foul storm out for we
1	traffic in mockery 
1	violence upon the roads violence of horses 
1	some few have handsome riders are garlanded
1	on delicate sensitive ear or tossing mane 
1	but wearied running round and round in their courses
1	all break and vanish and evil gathers head 
1	herodias daughters have returned again
1	a sudden blast of dusty wind and after
1	thunder of feet tumult of images 
1	their purpose in the labyrinth of the wind 
1	all turn with amorous cries or angry cries 
1	according to the wind for all are blind 
1	but now wind drops dust settles thereupon
1	there lurches past his great eyes without thought
1	under the shadow of stupid straw pale locks 
1	that insolent fiend robert artisson
1	to whom the love lorn lady kyteler brought
1	bronzed peacock feathers red combs of her cocks 
1	if you that have grown old were the first dead
1	neither caltapa tree nor scented lime
1	should hear my living feet nor would i tread
1	where we wrought that shall break the teeth of time 
1	let the new faces play what tricks they will
1	in the old rooms night can outbalance day 
1	our shadows rove the garden gravel still 
1	the living seem more shadowy than they 
1	bid a strong ghost stand at the head
1	that my michael may sleep sound 
1	nor cry nor turn in the bed
1	till his morning meal come round 
1	and may departing twilight keep
1	all dread afar till morning s back
1	that his mother may not lack
1	her fill of sleep 
1	bid the ghost have sword in hand 
1	there are malicious things although
1	few dream that they exist 
1	who have planned his murder for they know
1	of some most haughty deed or thought
1	that waits upon his future days 
1	and would through hatred of the bays
1	bring that to nought 
1	though you can fashion everything
1	from nothing every day and teach
1	the morning stars to sing 
1	you have lacked articulate speech
1	to tell your simplest want and known 
1	wailing upon a woman s knee 
1	all of that worst ignominy
1	of flesh and bone 
1	and when through all the town there ran
1	the servants of your enemy
1	a woman and a man 
1	unless the holy writings lie 
1	have borne you through the smooth and rough
1	and through the fertile and waste 
1	protecting till the danger past
1	with human love 
1	i am jealous of the looks men turn on you
1	for all men love your worth and i must rage
1	at my own image in the looking glass
1	that s so unlike myself that when you praise it
1	it is as though you praise another or even
1	mock me with praise of my mere opposite 
1	and when i wake towards morn i dread myself
1	for the heart cries that what deception wins
1	my cruelty must keep and so begone
1	if you have seen that image and not my worth 
1	all men have praised my strength but not my worth 
1	if you are no more strength than i am beauty
1	i will find out some cavern in the hills
1	and live among the ancient holy men 
1	for they at least have all men s reverence
1	and have no need of cruelty to keep
1	what no deception won 
1	i have heard them say
1	that men have reverence for their holiness
1	and not their worth 
1	god loves us for our worth 
1	but what care i that long for a man s love 
1	when my days that have
1	from cradle run to grave
1	from grave to cradle run instead 
1	when thoughts that a fool
1	has wound upon a spool
1	are but loose thread are but loose thread 
1	when cradle and spool are past
1	and i mere shade at last
1	coagulate of stuff
1	transparent like the wind 
1	i think that i may find
1	a faithful love a faithful love 
1	through winter time we call on spring 
1	and through the spring on summer call 
1	and when abounding hedges sing
1	declare that winter s best of all 
1	and after that there s nothing good
1	because the spring time has not come 
1	nor know that what disturbs our blood
1	is but its longing for the tomb 
1	die seanchan and proclaim the right of the poets 
1	come nearer me that i may know how face
1	differs from face and touch you with my hands 
1	o more than kin o more than children could be 
1	for children are but born out of our blood
1	and share our frailty o my chicks my chicks 
1	that i have nourished underneath my wings
1	and fed upon my soul he stands up and begins to walk
1	down steps i need no help 
1	he needs no help that joy has lifted up
1	like some miraculous beast out of ezekiel 
1	the man that dies has the chief part in the story 
1	and i will mock and mock and mock that image yonder
1	that evil picture in the sky no no 
1	i have all my strength again i will outface it 
1	o look upon the moon that s standing there
1	in the blue daylight notice her complexion
1	because it is the white of leprosy
1	and the contagion that afflicts mankind
1	falls from the moon when i and these are dead
1	we should be carried to some windy hill
1	to lie there with uncovered face awhile
1	that mankind and that leper there may know
1	dead faces laugh 
1	 he falls and then half rises 
1	king king dead faces laugh 
1	 he dies 
1	king king he is dead some strange triumphant thought
1	so filled his heart with joy that it has burst
1	being grown too mighty for our frailty 
1	and we who gaze grow like him and abhor
1	the moments that come between us and that death
1	you promised us 
1	take up his body 
1	go where you please and lay it where you please 
1	so that i cannot see his face or any
1	that cried him towards his death 
1	dead faces laugh 
1	the ancient right is gone the new remains
1	and that is death 
1	 they go towards the king holding out their halters 
1	we are impatient men 
1	so gather up the halters in your hands 
1	drive them away 
1	 he goes into the palace the soldiers block the way before
1	the pupils 
1	here is no place for you 
1	for he and his pretensions now are finished 
1	begone before the men at arms are bidden
1	to hurl you from the door 
1	take up his body
1	and cry that driven from the populous door
1	he seeks high waters and the mountain birds
1	to claim a portion of their solitude 
1	 they make a litter with cloak and staffs and lay seanchan
1	and cry that when they took his ancient right
1	they took all common sleep therefore he claims
1	the mountain for his mattress and his pillow 
1	and there he can sleep on not noticing
1	although the world be changed from worse to worse 
1	amid the changeless clamour of the curlew 
1	 they raise the litter on their shoulders and move a few steps 
1	 motioning to them to stop 
1	yet make triumphant music sing aloud
1	for coming times will bless what he has blessed
1	and curse what he has cursed 
1	no no be still 
1	or pluck a solemn music from the strings 
1	you wrong his greatness speaking so of triumph 
1	o silver trumpets be you lifted up
1	and cry to the great race that is to come 
1	long throated swans upon the waves of time
1	sing loudly for beyond the wall of the world
1	that race may hear our music and awake 
1	 motioning the musicians to lower their trumpets 
1	not what it leaves behind it in the light
1	but what it carries with it to the dark
1	exalts the soul nor song nor trumpet blast
1	can call up races from the worsening world
1	to mend the wrong and mar the solitude
1	of the great shade we follow to the tomb 
1	 fedelm and the pupils go out carrying the litter some play
1	a mournful music 
1	here ends seven poems and a fragment by william butler yeats 
1	nineteen hundred and twenty two 
1	hum in the lime tree flowers and put away
1	the unavailing outcries and the old bitterness
1	that empty the heart i have forgot awhile
1	tara uprooted and new commonness
1	upon the throne and crying about the streets
1	and hanging its paper flowers from post to post 
1	because it is alone of all things happy 
1	i am contented for i know that quiet
1	wanders laughing and eating her wild heart
1	among pigeons and bees while that great archer 
1	who but awaits his hour to shoot still hangs
1	a cloudy quiver over parc na lee 
1	maeve the great queen was pacing to and fro 
1	between the walls covered with beaten bronze 
1	in her high house at cruachan the long hearth 
1	flickering with ash and hazel but half showed
1	where the tired horse boys lay upon the rushes 
1	or on the benches underneath the walls 
1	in comfortable sleep all living slept
1	but that great queen who more than half the night
1	had paced from door to fire and fire to door 
1	though now in her old age in her young age
1	she had been beautiful in that old way
1	that s all but gone for the proud heart is gone
1	and the fool heart of the counting house fears all
1	but soft beauty and indolent desire 
1	she could have called over the rim of the world
1	whatever woman s lover had hit her fancy 
1	and yet had been great bodied and great limbed 
1	fashioned to be the mother of strong children 
1	and she d had lucky eyes and a high heart 
1	and wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax 
1	at need and made her beautiful and fierce 
1	sudden and laughing 
1	o unquiet heart 
1	why do you praise another praising her 
1	as if there were no tale but your own tale
1	worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound 
1	have i not bid you tell of that great queen
1	who has been buried some two thousand years 
1	when night was at its deepest a wild goose
1	cried from the porter s lodge and with long clamour
1	shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks 
1	but the horse boys slept on as though some power
1	had filled the house with druid heaviness 
1	and wondering who of the many changing sidhe
1	had come as in the old times to counsel her 
1	maeve walked yet with slow footfall being old 
1	to that small chamber by the outer gate 
1	the porter slept although he sat upright
1	with still and stony limbs and open eyes 
1	maeve waited and when that ear piercing noise
1	broke from his parted lips and broke again 
1	she laid a hand on either of his shoulders 
1	and shook him wide awake and bid him say
1	who of the wandering many changing ones
1	had troubled his sleep but all he had to say
1	was that the air being heavy and the dogs
1	more still than they had been for a good month 
1	he had fallen asleep and though he had dreamed nothing 
1	he could remember when he had had fine dreams 
1	it was before the time of the great war
1	she turned away he turned again to sleep
1	that no god troubled now and wondering
1	what matters were afoot among the sidhe 
1	maeve walked through that great hall and with a sigh
1	lifted the curtain of her sleeping room 
1	remembering that she too had seemed divine
1	to many thousand eyes and to her own
1	one that the generations had long waited
1	that work too difficult for mortal hands
1	might be accomplished bunching the curtain up
1	she saw her husband ailell sleeping there 
1	and thought of days when he d had a straight body 
1	and of that famous fergus nessa s husband 
1	who had been the lover of her middle life 
1	suddenly ailell spoke out of his sleep 
1	and not with his own voice or a man s voice 
1	but with the burning live unshaken voice
1	of those that it may be can never age 
1	he said high queen of cruachan and mag ai
1	a king of the great plain would speak with you 
1	and with glad voice maeve answered him what king
1	of the far wandering shadows has come to me 
1	as in the old days when they would come and go
1	about my threshold to counsel and to help 
1	the parted lips replied i seek your help 
1	for i am aengus and i am crossed in love 
1	 how may a mortal whose life gutters out
1	help them that wander with hand clasping hand
1	by rivers where nor rain nor hail has dimmed
1	their haughty images that cannot fade
1	although their beauty s like a hollow dream 
1	 i come from the undimmed rivers to bid you call
1	the children of the maines out of sleep 
1	and set them digging into anbual s hill 
1	we shadows while they uproot his earthy house 
1	will overthrow his shadows and carry off
1	caer his blue eyed daughter that i love 
1	i helped your fathers when they built these walls
1	and i would have your help in my great need 
1	queen of high cruachan 
1	 i obey your will
1	with speedy feet and a most thankful heart 
1	for you have been o aengus of the birds 
1	our giver of good counsel and good luck 
1	and with a groan as if the mortal breath
1	could but awaken sadly upon lips
1	that happier breath had moved her husband turned
1	face downward tossing in a troubled sleep 
1	but maeve and not with a slow feeble foot 
1	came to the threshold of the painted house 
1	where her grandchildren slept and cried aloud 
1	until the pillared dark began to stir
1	with shouting and the clang of unhooked arms 
1	she told them of the many changing ones 
1	and all that night and all through the next day
1	to middle night they dug into the hill 
1	at middle night great cats with silver claws 
1	bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls 
1	came up out of the hole and red eared hounds
1	with long white bodies came out of the air
1	suddenly and ran at them and harried them 
1	with quaking joints and terror strucken faces 
1	till maeve called out these are but common men 
1	casts up a show and the winds answer it
1	with holy shadows her high heart was glad 
1	and when the uproar ran along the grass
1	she followed with light footfall in the midst 
1	till it died out where an old thorn tree stood 
1	friend of these many years you too had stood
1	with equal courage in that whirling rout 
1	for you although you ve not her wandering heart 
1	have all that greatness and not hers alone 
1	for there is no high story about queens
1	in any ancient book but tells of you 
1	and when i ve heard how they grew old and died
1	or fell into unhappiness i ve said 
1	 she will grow old and die and she has wept 
1	and when i d write it out anew the words 
1	outrun the measure 
1	i d tell of that great queen
1	who stood amid a silence by the thorn
1	until two lovers came out of the air
1	with bodies made out of soft fire the one
1	about whose face birds wagged their fiery wings
1	said aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks
1	to maeve and to maeve s household owing all
1	in owing them the bride bed that gives peace 
1	then maeve o aengus master of all lovers 
1	a thousand years ago you held high talk
1	with the first kings of many pillared cruachan 
1	o when will you grow weary 
1	they had vanished 
1	but out of the dark air over her head there came
1	a murmur of soft words and meeting lips 
1	argument baile and aillinn were lovers but
1	aengus the master of love wishing them to be
1	happy in his own land among the dead told to
1	each a story of the other s death so that their
1	hearts were broken and they died 
1	i hardly hear the curlew cry 
1	nor the grey rush when wind is high 
1	before my thoughts begin to run
1	on the heir of ulad buan s son 
1	baile who had the honey mouth 
1	and that mild woman of the south 
1	aillinn who was king lugaid s heir 
1	their love was never drowned in care
1	of this or that thing nor grew cold
1	because their bodies had grown old 
1	being forbid to marry on earth
1	they blossomed to immortal mirth 
1	about the time when christ was born 
1	when the long wars for the white horn
1	and the brown bull had not yet come 
1	young baile honey mouth whom some
1	called rather baile little land 
1	rode out of emain with a band
1	of harpers and young men and they
1	imagined as they struck the way
1	to many pastured muirthemne 
1	that all things fell out happily
1	and there for all that fools had said 
1	baile and aillinn would be wed 
1	they found an old man running there 
1	he had ragged long grass yellow hair 
1	he had knees that stuck out of his hose 
1	he had puddle water in his shoes 
1	he had half a cloak to keep him dry 
1	although he had a squirrel s eye 
1	o wandering birds and rushy beds
1	you put such folly in our heads
1	with all this crying in the wind
1	no common love is to our mind 
1	and our poor kate or nan is less
1	than any whose unhappiness
1	awoke the harp strings long ago 
1	yet they that know all things but know
1	that all life had to give us is
1	a child s laughter a woman s kiss 
1	who was it put so great a scorn
1	in the grey reeds that night and morn
1	are trodden and broken by the herds 
1	and in the light bodies of birds
1	that north wind tumbles to and fro
1	and pinches among hail and snow 
1	that runner said i am from the south 
1	to tell him how the girl aillinn
1	rode from the country of her kin
1	and old and young men rode with her 
1	for all that country had been astir
1	if anybody half as fair
1	had chosen a husband anywhere
1	but where it could see her every day 
1	when they had ridden a little way
1	an old man caught the horse s head
1	with you must home again and wed
1	with somebody in your own land 
1	a young man cried and kissed her hand
1	 o lady wed with one of us 
1	and when no face grew piteous
1	for any gentle thing she spake
1	she fell and died of the heart break 
1	because a lover s heart s worn out
1	being tumbled and blown about
1	by its own blind imagining 
1	and will believe that anything
1	that is bad enough to be true is true 
1	baile s heart was broken in two 
1	and he being laid upon green boughs
1	was carried to the goodly house
1	where the hound of ulad sat before
1	the brazen pillars of his door 
1	his face bowed low to weep the end
1	of the harper s daughter and her friend 
1	for although years had passed away
1	he always wept them on that day 
1	for on that day they had been betrayed 
1	and now that honey mouth is laid
1	under a cairn of sleepy stone
1	before his eyes he has tears for none 
1	although he is carrying stone but two
1	for whom the cairn s but heaped anew 
1	we hold because our memory is
1	so full of that thing and of this
1	that out of sight is out of mind 
1	but the grey rush under the wind
1	and the grey bird with crooked bill
1	have such long memories that they still
1	remember deirdre and her man 
1	and when we walk with kate or nan
1	about the windy water side
1	our heart can hear the voices chide 
1	how could we be so soon content
1	who know the way that naoise went 
1	and they have news of deirdre s eyes
1	who being lovely was so wise 
1	ah wise my heart knows well how wise 
1	now had that old gaunt crafty one 
1	gathering his cloak about him run
1	where aillinn rode with waiting maids
1	who amid leafy lights and shades
1	dreamed of the hands that would unlace
1	their bodices in some dim place
1	when they had come to the marriage bed 
1	and harpers pondering with bowed head
1	a music that had thought enough
1	of the ebb of all things to make love
1	grow gentle without sorrowings 
1	and leather coated men with slings
1	who peered about on every side 
1	and amid leafy light he cried 
1	 he is well out of wind and wave 
1	they have heaped the stones above his grave
1	in muirthemne and over it
1	in changeless ogham letters writ
1	baile that was of rury s seed 
1	but the gods long ago decreed
1	no waiting maid should ever spread
1	baile and aillinn s marriage bed 
1	for they should clip and clip again
1	where wild bees hive on the great plain 
1	therefore it is but little news
1	that put this hurry in my shoes 
1	and hurrying to the south he came
1	to that high hill the herdsmen name
1	the hill seat of leighin because
1	some god or king had made the laws
1	that held the land together there 
1	in old times among the clouds of the air 
1	that old man climbed the day grew dim 
1	two swans came flying up to him
1	linked by a gold chain each to each
1	and with low murmuring laughing speech
1	alighted on the windy grass 
1	they knew him his changed body was
1	tall proud and ruddy and light wings
1	were hovering over the harp strings
1	that etain midhir s wife had wove
1	in the hid place being crazed by love 
1	what shall i call them fish that swim
1	scale rubbing scale where light is dim
1	by a broad water lily leaf 
1	or mice in the one wheaten sheaf
1	forgotten at the threshing place 
1	or birds lost in the one clear space
1	of morning light in a dim sky 
1	or it may be the eyelids of one eye
1	or the door pillars of one house 
1	or two sweet blossoming apple boughs
1	that have one shadow on the ground 
1	or the two strings that made one sound
1	where that wise harper s finger ran 
1	for this young girl and this young man
1	have happiness without an end
1	because they have made so good a friend 
1	they know all wonders for they pass
1	the towery gates of gorias
1	and long forgotten murias 
1	among the giant kings whose hoard
1	cauldron and spear and stone and sword
1	was robbed before earth gave the wheat 
1	wandering from broken street to street
1	they come where some huge watcher is
1	and tremble with their love and kiss 
1	they know undying things for they
1	wander where earth withers away 
1	though nothing troubles the great streams
1	but light from the pale stars and gleams
1	from the holy orchards where there is none
1	but fruit that is of precious stone 
1	or apples of the sun and moon 
1	what were our praise to them they eat
1	quiet s wild heart like daily meat 
1	who when night thickens are afloat
1	on dappled skins in a glass boat
1	far out under a windless sky 
1	while over them birds of aengus fly 
1	and over the tiller and the prow
1	 all rights reserved 
1	and waving white wings to and fro
1	awaken wanderings of light air
1	to stir their coverlet and their hair 
1	and poets found old writers say 
1	a yew tree where his body lay 
1	but a wild apple hid the grass
1	with its sweet blossom where hers was 
1	and being in good heart because
1	a better time had come again
1	after the deaths of many men 
1	and that long fighting at the ford 
1	they wrote on tablets of thin board 
1	set up electrotyped and published august 
1	made of the apple and the yew 
1	all the love stories that they knew 
1	let rush and bird cry out their fill
1	of the harper s daughter if they will 
1	beloved i am not afraid of her
1	she is not wiser nor lovelier 
1	and you are more high of heart than she
1	for all her wanderings over sea 
1	but i d have bird and rush forget
1	those other two for never yet
1	has lover lived but longed to wive
1	like them that are no more alive 
1	i thought of your beauty and this arrow
1	made out of a wild thought is in my marrow 
1	there s no man may look upon her no man 
1	as when newly grown to be a woman 
1	blossom pale she pulled down the pale blossom
1	at the moth hour and hid it in her bosom 
1	this beauty s kinder yet for a reason
1	i could weep that the old is out of season 
1	one that is ever kind said yesterday 
1	 your well beloved s hair has threads of grey
1	and little shadows come about her eyes 
1	time can but make it easier to be wise
1	though now it s hard till trouble is at an end 
1	and so be patient be wise and patient friend 
1	but heart there is no comfort not a grain 
1	time can but make her beauty over again
1	because of that great nobleness of hers 
1	the fire that stirs about her when she stirs
1	burns but more clearly o she had not these ways
1	when all the wild summer was in her gaze 
1	o heart o heart if she d but turn her head 
1	you d know the folly of being comforted 
1	i cried when the moon was murmuring to the birds 
1	 let peewit call and curlew cry where they will 
1	i long for your merry and tender and pitiful words 
1	for the roads are unending and there is no place to my mind 
1	the honey pale moon lay low on the sleepy hill
1	and i fell asleep upon lonely echtge of streams 
1	no boughs have withered because of the wintry wind 
1	the boughs have withered because i have told them my dreams 
1	i know of the leafy paths that the witches take 
1	who come with their crowns of pearl and their spindles of wool 
1	and their secret smile out of the depths of the lake 
1	and of apple islands where the danaan kind
1	wind and unwind their dances when the light grows cool
1	on the island lawns their feet where the pale foam gleams 
1	no boughs have withered because of the wintry wind 
1	the boughs have withered because i have told them my dreams 
1	i know of the sleepy country where swans fly round
1	coupled with golden chains and sing as they fly 
1	a king and a queen are wandering there and the sound
1	has made them so happy and hopeless so deaf and so blind
1	with wisdom they wander till all the years have gone by 
1	i know and the curlew and peewit on echtge of streams 
1	no boughs have withered because of the wintry wind 
1	the boughs have withered because i have told them my dreams 
1	we sat together at one summer s end
1	that beautiful mild woman your close friend
1	and you and i and talked of poetry 
1	i said a line will take us hours maybe 
1	yet if it does not seem a moment s thought
1	our stitching and unstitching has been naught 
1	better go down upon your marrow bones
1	and scrub a kitchen pavement or break stones
1	like an old pauper in all kinds of weather 
1	for to articulate sweet sounds together
1	is to work harder than all these and yet
1	be thought an idler by the noisy set
1	of bankers schoolmasters and clergymen
1	the martyrs call the world 
1	that woman then
1	murmured with her young voice for whose mild sake
1	there s many a one shall find out all heartache
1	in finding that it s young and mild and low 
1	 there is one thing that all we women know
1	although we never heard of it at school 
1	that we must labour to be beautiful 
1	i said it s certain there is no fine thing
1	since adam s fall but needs much labouring 
1	there have been lovers who thought love should be
1	so much compounded of high courtesy
1	that they would sigh and quote with learned looks
1	precedents out of beautiful old books 
1	yet now it seems an idle trade enough 
1	we sat grown quiet at the name of love 
1	we saw the last embers of daylight die
1	and in the trembling blue green of the sky
1	a moon worn as if it had been a shell
1	washed by time s waters as they rose and fell
1	about the stars and broke in days and years 
1	i had a thought for no one s but your ears 
1	that you were beautiful and that i strove
1	to love you in the old high way of love 
1	that it had all seemed happy and yet we d grown
1	as weary hearted as that hollow moon 
1	the old brown thorn trees break in two high over cummen strand
1	under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand 
1	our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies 
1	but we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes
1	of cathleen the daughter of houlihan 
1	the wind has bundled up the clouds high over knocknarea
1	and thrown the thunder on the stones for all that maeve can say 
1	angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat 
1	but we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet
1	of cathleen the daughter of houlihan 
1	the yellow pool has overflowed high up on clooth na bare 
1	for the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air 
1	like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood 
1	but purer than a tall candle before the holy rood
1	is cathleen the daughter of houlihan 
1	i heard the old old men say
1	 everything alters 
1	and one by one we drop away 
1	they had hands like claws and their knees
1	were twisted like the old thorn trees
1	by the waters 
1	i heard the old old men say
1	 all that s beautiful drifts away
1	like the waters 
1	i have no happiness in dreaming of brycelinde 
1	nor avalon the grass green hollow nor joyous isle 
1	where one found lancelot crazed and hid him for a while 
1	nor ulad when naoise had thrown a sail upon the wind 
1	nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the heart 
1	land under wave where out of the moon s light and the sun s
1	seven old sisters wind the threads of the long lived ones 
1	land of the tower where aengus has thrown the gates apart 
1	and wood of wonders where one kills an ox at dawn
1	to find it when night falls laid on a golden bier 
1	therein are many queens like branwen and guinivere 
1	and whether i go in my dreams by woodland or dun or shore 
1	or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar 
1	i hear the harp string praise them or hear their mournful talk 
1	because of a story i heard under the thin horn
1	of the third moon that hung between the night and the day 
1	to dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay 
1	even in an old story is a burden not to be borne 
1	three voices together
1	hurry to bless the hands that play 
1	the mouths that speak the notes and strings 
1	o masters of the glittering town 
1	o lay the shrilly trumpet down 
1	though drunken with the flags that sway
1	over the ramparts and the towers 
1	and with the waving of your wings 
1	maybe they linger by the way 
1	one gathers up his purple gown 
1	one leans and mutters by the wall 
1	he dreads the weight of mortal hours 
1	o no o no they hurry down
1	like plovers that have heard the call 
1	o kinsmen of the three in one 
1	o kinsmen bless the hands that play 
1	the notes they waken shall live on
1	when all this heavy history s done 
1	our hands our hands must ebb away 
1	three voices together
1	the proud and careless notes live on
1	but bless our hands that ebb away 
1	from the play of the country of the young 
1	there s many a strong farmer
1	whose heart would break in two
1	if he could see the townland
1	that we are riding to 
1	boughs have their fruit and blossom 
1	at all times of the year 
1	rivers are running over
1	with red beer and brown beer 
1	an old man plays the bagpipes
1	in a golden and silver wood 
1	queens their eyes blue like the ice 
1	are dancing in a crowd 
1	the little fox he murmured 
1	 o what is the world s bane 
1	the sun was laughing sweetly 
1	the moon plucked at my rein 
1	but the little red fox murmured 
1	 o do not pluck at his rein 
1	he is riding to the townland
1	that is the world s bane 
1	when their hearts are so high 
1	that they would come to blows 
1	they unhook their heavy swords
1	from golden and silver boughs 
1	but all that are killed in battle
1	awaken to life again 
1	it is lucky that their story
1	is not known among men 
1	for o the strong farmers
1	for their hearts would be like a cup
1	that somebody had drunk dry 
1	the little fox he murmured 
1	 o what is the world s bane 
1	the sun was laughing sweetly 
1	the moon plucked at my rein 
1	but the little red fox murmured 
1	 o do not pluck at his rein 
1	he is riding to the townland
1	that is the world s bane 
1	michael will unhook his trumpet
1	from a bough overhead 
1	and blow a little noise
1	when the supper has been spread 
1	gabriel will come from the water
1	with a fish tail and talk
1	of wonders that have happened
1	on wet roads where men walk 
1	and lift up an old horn
1	of hammered silver and drink
1	till he has fallen asleep
1	upon the starry brink 
1	the little fox he murmured 
1	 o what is the world s bane 
1	the sun was laughing sweetly 
1	the moon plucked at my rein 
1	but the little red fox murmured 
1	 o do not pluck at his rein 
1	he is riding to the townland 
1	that is the world s bane 
1	i made some of these poems walking about
1	among the seven woods before the big wind of
1	nineteen hundred and three blew down so many
1	trees troubled the wild creatures changed the
1	look of things and i thought out there a good
1	part of the play which follows the first shape of
1	it came to me in a dream but it changed much in
1	the making foreshadowing it may be a change
1	that may bring a less dream burdened will into my
1	verses i never re wrote anything so many times 
1	for at first i could not make these wills that stream
1	into mere life poetical but now i hope to do
1	easily much more of the kind and that our new
1	irish players will find the buskin and the sock 
1	cuchullain the king of muirthemne 
1	concobar the high king of ullad 
1	daire a king 
1	fintain a blind man 
1	barach a fool 
1	fintain a fat blind man who is somewhat older 
1	what is his name fool 
1	they are chairs 
1	and this 
1	why that s a bench 
1	and this 
1	a big chair 
1	and there is another big chair on the other side of the hall 
1	they have 
1	about the young man and the fighting 
1	and after that we can go and eat the fowl for i am hungry 
1	time enough time enough you re in as great a hurry as when you
1	it matters nothing to us but he has come at last 
1	who has come 
1	you saw him 
1	i used to be in aoife s country when i had my eyesight 
1	nobody could do that who was his father 
1	nobody but aoife knew that not even he himself 
1	not even he himself was aoife a goddess lecherous 
1	thought him one of the riders of the sidhe because the child was
1	you have thought something 
1	how can he have cuchullain s eyes 
1	he is cuchullain s son 
1	and his mother has sent him hither to fight his father 
1	i have remembered that i am hungry 
1	i won t listen to your story 
1	no there is plenty for us both 
1	come with me where it is 
1	it is a fine fowl it was the biggest in the yard 
1	no no he begins pulling fintain towards the door 
1	no no i am hungry what a head you have blind man who but you
1	you have hurled that stone beyond our utmost mark
1	time after time but yet you are not weary 
1	he has slept on the bare ground of fuad s hill
1	this week past waiting for the bulls and the deer 
1	well why should i be weary 
1	it is certain
1	his father was the god who wheels the sun 
1	and not king sualtam 
1	 to a young king who is beside him he came in the dawn 
1	and folded dectara in a sudden fire 
1	and yet the mother s half might well grow weary 
1	and it new come from labours over sea 
1	he has been on islands walled about with silver 
1	and fought with giants 
1	 they gather about the ale vat and begin to drink 
1	who was it that went out 
1	as we came in 
1	barach and blind fintain 
1	they always flock together the blind man
1	has need of the fool s eyesight and strong body 
1	while the poor fool has need of the other s wit 
1	and night and day is up to his ears in mischief
1	that the blind man imagines there s no hen yard
1	but clucks and cackles when he passes by
1	as if he d been a fox if i d that ball
1	that s in your hair and the big stone again 
1	i d keep them tossing though the one is heavy
1	and the other light in the hand a trick i learnt
1	when i was learning arms in aoife s country 
1	what kind of woman was that aoife 
1	but i have heard that she was never married 
1	and yet that s natural for i have never known
1	a fighting woman but made her favours cheap 
1	or mocked at love till she grew sandy dry 
1	what manner of woman do you like the best 
1	a gentle or a fierce 
1	a gentle surely 
1	i think that a fierce woman s better a woman
1	that breaks away when you have thought her won 
1	for i d be fed and hungry at one time 
1	i think that all deep passion is but a kiss
1	in the mid battle and a difficult peace
1	 twixt oil and water candles and dark night 
1	hill side and hollow the hot footed sun 
1	and the cold sliding slippery footed moon 
1	a brief forgiveness between opposites
1	that have been hatreds for three times the age
1	of his long stablished ground here s concobar 
1	so i ll be done but keep beside me still 
1	for while he talks of hammered bronze and asks
1	what wood is best for building we can talk
1	of a fierce woman 
1	 to one of those about him has the ship gone
1	yet we have need of more bronze workers
1	and that ship i sent to africa for gold is late 
1	i knew their talk 
1	 seeing cuchullain you are before us king 
1	so much the better for i welcome you
1	but who are these 
1	the odour from their garments when they stir
1	is like a wind out of an apple garden 
1	my swordsmen and harp players and fine dancers 
1	my bosom friends 
1	i should have thought cuchullain 
1	my graver company would better match
1	your greatness and your years but i waste breath
1	in harping on that tale 
1	you do great king 
1	because their youth is the kind wandering wave
1	that carries me about the world and if it sank 
1	my sword would lose its lightness 
1	emain should be the foremost town of the world 
1	it is the foremost town 
1	no no it s not 
1	nothing but men can make towns great and he 
1	the one over topping man that s in the world 
1	keeps far away 
1	he will not hear you king 
1	and we old men had best keep company
1	with one another i ll fill the horn for you 
1	i will not drink old fool you have drunk a horn
1	at every door we came to 
1	you d better drink 
1	for old men light upon their youth again
1	in the brown ale when i have drunk enough 
1	i am like cuchullain as one pea another 
1	and live like a bird s flight from tree to tree 
1	we ll to our chairs for we have much to talk of 
1	and we have ullad and muirthemne and here
1	is conall muirthemne in the nick of time 
1	will you not drink 
1	not till the council s over 
1	but i ll drink daire 
1	fill me a horn too daire 
1	if i d drunk half that you have drunk to day 
1	i d be upon all fours 
1	that would be natural
1	when mother earth had given you this good milk
1	from her great breasts 
1	 to one of the young kings beside him 
1	one is content awhile
1	with a soft warm woman who folds up our lives
1	in silky network then one knows not why 
1	but one s away after a flinty heart 
1	how long can the net keep us 
1	all our lives
1	if there are children and a dozen moons
1	if there are none because a growing child
1	has so much need of watching it can make
1	a passion that s as changeable as the sea
1	change till it holds the wide earth to its heart 
1	at least i have heard a father say it but i
1	being childless do not know it come nearer yet 
1	though he is ringing that old silver rod
1	we ll have our own talk out they cannot hear us 
1	i have called you hither kings of ullad and kings
1	and tributary kings for now there is peace 
1	it s time to build up emain that was burned
1	at the outsetting of these wars for we 
1	being the foremost men should have high chairs
1	and be much stared at and wondered at and speak
1	out of more laughing overflowing hearts
1	than common men it is the art of kings
1	to make what s noble nobler in men s eyes
1	by wide uplifted roofs where beaten gold 
1	that s ruddy with desire marries pale silver
1	among the shadowing beams and many a time
1	i would have called you hither to this work 
1	but always when i d all but summoned you 
1	some war or some rebellion would break out 
1	where s maine morgor and old usnach s children 
1	and that high headed even walking queen 
1	and many near as great that got their death
1	because you hated peace i can remember
1	the people crying out when deirdre passed
1	and maine morgor had a cold grey eye 
1	well well i ll throw this heel tap on the ground 
1	for it may be they are thirsty 
1	be silent fool 
1	be silent daire 
1	let him speak his mind 
1	i have no need to be afraid of ghosts 
1	for i have made but necessary wars 
1	i warred to strengthen emain or because
1	when wars are out they marry and beget
1	and have their generations like mankind
1	and there s no help for it but i m well content
1	that they have ended and left the town so great 
1	that its mere name shall be in times to come
1	like a great ale vat where the men of the world
1	shall drink no common ale but the hard will 
1	the unquenchable hope the friendliness of the sword 
1	give me the building plans and have you written
1	that we cuchullain is looking in his shield 
1	it may be the pale riders of the wind
1	throw pictures on it or that mananan 
1	his father s friend and sometime fosterer 
1	foreknower of all things has cast a vision 
1	out of the cold dark of the rich sea 
1	foretelling emain s greatness 
1	no great king 
1	i looked on this out of mere idleness 
1	imagining a woman that i loved 
1	 the sound of a trumpet without 
1	open the door for that is a herald s trumpet 
1	centre of the hall the trumpeting ceases 
1	what is your message 
1	i am of aoife s army 
1	queen aoife and her army have fallen upon us 
1	out swords out swords 
1	they are about the house 
1	rush out rush out before they have fired the thatch 
1	aoife is far away i am alone 
1	i have come alone in the midst of you
1	to weigh this sword against cuchullain s sword 
1	 there is a murmur amongst the kings 
1	and are you noble for if of common seed
1	you cannot weigh your sword against his sword
1	but in mixed battle 
1	i am under bonds
1	to tell my name to no man but it s noble 
1	but i would know your name and not your bonds 
1	you cannot speak in the assembly house
1	if you are not noble 
1	 drawing his sword 
1	i will give no other proof than the hawk gives
1	that it s no sparrow 
1	 he is silent a moment then speaks to all 
1	yet look upon me kings 
1	i too am of that ancient seed and carry
1	the signs about this body and in these bones 
1	to have shown the hawk s grey feather is enough
1	and you speak highly too 
1	give me that helmet 
1	i d thought they had grown weary sending champions 
1	that coat will do i d half forgotten boy 
1	how all those great kings came into the mouse trap
1	that had been baited with maeve s pretty daughter 
1	how findabair that blue eyed findabair 
1	but the tale is worthy of a winter s night 
1	that buckle should be tighter give me your shield 
1	there is good level ground at baile s yew tree
1	some dozen yards from here and it s but truth
1	that i am sad to day and this fight welcome 
1	hither into the light 
1	 turning to one of the young kings 
1	that s the very tint
1	of her that i was speaking of but now 
1	not a pin s difference 
1	you are from the north
1	where there are many that have that tint of hair
1	red brown the light red brown come nearer boy 
1	for i would have another look at you 
1	there s more likeness a pale a stone pale cheek 
1	what brought you boy have you no fear of death 
1	whether i live or die is in the gods hands 
1	that is all words all words a young man s talk 
1	i am their plough their harrow their very strength 
1	for he that s in the sun begot this body
1	upon a mortal woman and i have heard tell
1	it seemed as if he had outrun the moon 
1	that he must always follow through waste heaven 
1	he loved so happily he ll be but slow
1	to break a tree that was so sweetly planted 
1	let s see that arm i ll see it if i like 
1	that arm had a good father and a good mother
1	but it is not like this 
1	you are mocking me 
1	you think i am not worthy to be fought 
1	but i ll not wrangle but with this talkative knife 
1	put up your sword i am not mocking you 
1	i d have you for my friend but if it s not
1	because you have a hot heart and a cold eye
1	i cannot tell the reason you ve got her fierceness 
1	and nobody is as fierce as those pale women 
1	 to the young kings 
1	we ll keep him here in muirthemne awhile 
1	you are the leader of our pack and therefore
1	may cry what you will 
1	you ll stop with us
1	and we will hunt the deer and the wild bulls
1	and when we have grown weary light our fires
1	in sandy places where the wool white foam
1	is murmuring and breaking and it may be
1	that long haired women will come out of the dunes
1	to dance in the yellow fire light you hang your head 
1	young man as if it was not a good life 
1	and yet what s better than to hurl the spear 
1	and hear the long remembering harp and dance 
1	friendship grows quicker in the murmuring dark 
1	but i can see there s no more need for words
1	and that you ll be my friend now 
1	forbid their friendship for it will get twisted
1	to a reproach against us 
1	i d never need to cry cuchullain on
1	and would not now 
1	they ll say his manhood s quenched 
1	i ll give you gifts but i ll have something too 
1	an arm ring or the like and if you will
1	we ll fight it out when you are older boy 
1	aoife will make some story out of this 
1	well well what matter i ll have that arm ring boy 
1	there is no man i d sooner have my friend
1	than you whose name has gone about the world
1	as if it had been the wind but aoife d say
1	i had turned coward 
1	i ll give you gifts
1	that aoife ll know and all her people know
1	to have been my gifts mananan son of the sea
1	gave me this heavy purple cloak nine queens
1	of the land under wave had woven it
1	out of the fleeces of the sea o tell her
1	i was afraid or tell her what you will 
1	no tell her that i heard a raven croak
1	on the north side of the house and was afraid 
1	some witch of the air has troubled cuchullain s mind 
1	no witchcraft his head is like a woman s head
1	i had a fancy for 
1	a witch of the air
1	can make a leaf confound us with memories 
1	they have gone to school to learn the trick of it 
1	but there s no trick in this that arm ring boy 
1	he shall not go unfought i ll fight with him 
1	no i will fight with him 
1	i claim the fight 
1	for when we sent an army to her land 
1	i claim the fight for one of aoife s galleys
1	stole my great cauldron and a herd of pigs 
1	no no i claim it for at lammas time 
1	back back put up your swords put up your swords 
1	there s none alive that shall accept a challenge
1	i have refused laegaire put up your sword 
1	no let them come let any three together 
1	if they ve a mind to i ll try it out with four 
1	that s spoken as i d spoken it at your age 
1	but you are in my house whatever man
1	would fight with you shall fight it out with me 
1	 drawing his sword 
1	this mutterer this old whistler this sand piper 
1	this edge that s greyer than the tide this mouse
1	that s gnawing at the timbers of the world 
1	this this boy i would meet them all in arms
1	if i d a son like you he would avenge me
1	when i have withstood for the last time the men
1	whose fathers brothers sons and friends i have killed
1	upholding ullad when the four provinces
1	have gathered with the ravens over them 
1	but i d need no avenger you and i
1	would scatter them like water from a dish 
1	we ll stand by one another from this out 
1	here is the ring 
1	no turn and turn about
1	but my turn is first because i am the older 
1	cliodna embroidered these bird wings but fand
1	made all these little golden eyes with the hairs
1	that she had stolen out of aengus beard 
1	and therefore none that has this cloak about him
1	is crossed in love the heavy inlaid brooch
1	that buan hammered has a merit too 
1	 in a loud voice 
1	no more of that i will not have this friendship 
1	cuchullain is my man and i forbid it 
1	he shall not go unfought for i myself 
1	witchcraft has maddened you 
1	 shouting yes witchcraft witchcraft 
1	you saw another s head upon his shoulders
1	all of a sudden a woman s head cuchullain 
1	then raised your hand against the king of ullad 
1	 letting concobar go and looking wildly about him 
1	yes yes all of a sudden all of a sudden 
1	why there s no witchcraft in it i myself
1	have made a hundred of these sudden friendships
1	and fought it out next day but that was folly 
1	for now that i am old i know it is best
1	to live in comfort 
1	pull the fool away 
1	i ll throw a heel tap to the one that dies 
1	some witch is floating in the air above us 
1	yes witchcraft witchcraft and the power of witchcraft 
1	why did you do it was it calatin s daughters

1	a maggot that is eating up the earth 
1	 begins hacking at the chair with his sword 
1	no but a magpie for he s flown away 
1	he is outside the door 
1	outside the door 
1	he is under baile s yew tree 
1	concobar concobar the sword into your heart 
1	what is he doing now 
1	o he is fighting the waves 
1	he sees king concobar s crown on every one of them 
1	without 
1	where are the kings what are the kings doing 
1	come here fool come here i say 
1	with portrait and some new chapters net 
1	literature the new york herald 
1	 the best book of its kind that has appeared since maeterlinck s
1	i have heard the pigeons of the seven woods
1	make their faint thunder and the garden bees
1	not a poor fool understands 
1	 all rights reserved 
1	set up and electrotyped published march 
1	the trees are in their autumn beauty 
1	the woodland paths are dry 
1	under the october twilight the water
1	mirrors a still sky 
1	upon the brimming water among the stones
1	are nine and fifty swans 
1	the nineteenth autumn has come upon me
1	since i first made my count 
1	i saw before i had well finished 
1	all suddenly mount
1	and scatter wheeling in great broken rings
1	upon their clamorous wings 
1	i have looked upon those brilliant creatures 
1	and now my heart is sore 
1	all s changed since i hearing at twilight 
1	the first time on this shore 
1	the bell beat of their wings above my head 
1	trod with a lighter tread 
1	unwearied still lover by lover 
1	they paddle in the cold 
1	companionable streams or climb the air 
1	their hearts have not grown old 
1	passion or conquest wander where they will 
1	attend upon them still 
1	but now they drift on the still water
1	mysterious beautiful 
1	among what rushes will they build 
1	by what lake s edge or pool
1	delight men s eyes when i awake some day
1	to find they have flown away 
1	now that we re almost settled in our house
1	i ll name the friends that cannot sup with us
1	beside a fire of turf in the ancient tower 
1	and having talked to some late hour
1	climb up the narrow winding stair to bed 
1	discoverers of forgotten truth
1	or mere companions of my youth 
1	all all are in my thoughts to night being dead 
1	always we d have the new friend meet the old 
1	and we are hurt if either friend seem cold 
1	and there is salt to lengthen out the smart
1	in the affections of our heart 
1	and quarrels are blown up upon that head 
1	but not a friend that i would bring
1	this night can set us quarrelling 
1	for all that come into my mind are dead 
1	lionel johnson comes the first to mind 
1	that loved his learning better than mankind 
1	though courteous to the worst much falling he
1	brooded upon sanctity
1	till all his greek and latin learning seemed
1	a long blast upon the horn that brought
1	a little nearer to his thought
1	a measureless consummation that he dreamed 
1	and that enquiring man john synge comes next 
1	that dying chose the living world for text
1	and never could have rested in the tomb
1	but that long travelling he had come
1	towards nightfall upon certain set apart
1	in a most desolate stony place 
1	towards nightfall upon a race
1	passionate and simple like his heart 
1	and then i think of old george pollexfen 
1	in muscular youth well known to mayo men
1	for horsemanship at meets or at race courses 
1	that could have shown how purebred horses
1	and solid men for all their passion live
1	but as the outrageous stars incline
1	by opposition square and trine 
1	having grown sluggish and contemplative 
1	they were my close companions many a year 
1	a portion of my mind and life as it were 
1	and now their breathless faces seem to look
1	out of some old picture book 
1	i am accustomed to their lack of breath 
1	but not that my dear friend s dear son 
1	our sidney and our perfect man 
1	could share in that discourtesy of death 
1	for all things the delighted eye now sees
1	were loved by him the old storm broken trees
1	that cast their shadows upon road and bridge 
1	the tower set on the stream s edge 
1	the ford where drinking cattle make a stir
1	nightly and startled by that sound
1	the water hen must change her ground 
1	he might have been your heartiest welcomer 
1	when with the galway foxhounds he would ride
1	from castle taylor to the roxborough side
1	or esserkelly plain few kept his pace 
1	at mooneen he had leaped a place
1	so perilous that half the astonished meet
1	had shut their eyes and where was it
1	he rode a race without a bit 
1	and yet his mind outran the horses feet 
1	we dreamed that a great painter had been born
1	to cold clare rock and galway rock and thorn 
1	to that stern colour and that delicate line
1	that are our secret discipline
1	wherein the gazing heart doubles her might 
1	soldier scholar horseman he 
1	and yet he had the intensity
1	to have published all to be a world s delight 
1	what other could so well have counselled us
1	in all lovely intricacies of a house
1	as he that practised or that understood
1	all work in metal or in wood 
1	in moulded plaster or in carven stone 
1	soldier scholar horseman he 
1	and all he did done perfectly
1	as though he had but that one trade alone 
1	the entire combustible world in one small room
1	as though dried straw and if we turn about
1	the bare chimney is gone black out
1	because the work had finished in that flare 
1	soldier scholar horseman he 
1	as twere all life s epitome 
1	what made us dream that he could comb grey hair 
1	i had thought seeing how bitter is that wind
1	that shakes the shutter to have brought to mind
1	all those that manhood tried or childhood loved 
1	or boyish intellect approved 
1	with some appropriate commentary on each 
1	until imagination brought
1	a fitter welcome but a thought
1	of that late death took all my heart for speech 
1	i know that i shall meet my fate
1	somewhere among the clouds above 
1	those that i fight i do not hate
1	those that i guard i do not love 
1	my country is kiltartan cross 
1	my countrymen kiltartan s poor 
1	no likely end could bring them loss
1	or leave them happier than before 
1	nor law nor duty bade me fight 
1	nor public man nor angry crowds 
1	a lonely impulse of delight
1	drove to this tumult in the clouds 
1	i balanced all brought all to mind 
1	the years to come seemed waste of breath 
1	a waste of breath the years behind
1	in balance with this life this death 
1	i am worn out with dreams 
1	a weather worn marble triton
1	among the streams 
1	and all day long i look
1	upon this lady s beauty
1	as though i had found in book
1	a pictured beauty 
1	pleased to have filled the eyes
1	or the discerning ears 
1	delighted to be but wise 
1	for men improve with the years 
1	and yet and yet
1	is this my dream or the truth 
1	o would that we had met
1	when i had my burning youth 
1	but i grow old among dreams 
1	a weather worn marble triton
1	among the streams 
1	would i could cast a sail on the water
1	where many a king has gone
1	and many a king s daughter 
1	and alight at the comely trees and the lawn 
1	the playing upon pipes and the dancing 
1	and learn that the best thing is
1	to change my loves while dancing
1	and pay but a kiss for a kiss 
1	i would find by the edge of that water
1	the collar bone of a hare
1	worn thin by the lapping of water 
1	and pierce it through with a gimlet and stare
1	at the old bitter world where they marry in churches 
1	and laugh over the untroubled water
1	at all who marry in churches 
1	through the white thin bone of a hare 
1	 although i d lie lapped up in linen
1	a deal i d sweat and little earn
1	if i should live as live the neighbours 
1	cried the beggar billy byrne 
1	 stretch bones till the daylight come
1	on great grandfather s battered tomb 
1	upon a grey old battered tombstone
1	in glendalough beside the stream 
1	where the o byrnes and byrnes are buried 
1	he stretched his bones and fell in a dream
1	of sun and moon that a good hour
1	bellowed and pranced in the round tower 
1	of golden king and silver lady 
1	bellowing up and bellowing round 
1	till toes mastered a sweet measure 
1	mouth mastered a sweet sound 
1	prancing round and prancing up
1	until they pranced upon the top 
1	that golden king and that wild lady
1	sang till stars began to fade 
1	hands gripped in hands toes close together 
1	hair spread on the wind they made 
1	that lady and that golden king
1	could like a brace of blackbirds sing 
1	 it s certain that my luck is broken 
1	that rambling jailbird billy said 
1	 before nightfall i ll pick a pocket
1	and snug it in a feather bed 
1	i cannot find the peace of home
1	on great grandfather s battered tomb 
1	and kissed her dusky face 
1	 all day long from mid day
1	we have talked in the one place 
1	all day long from shadowless noon
1	we have gone round and round
1	in the narrow theme of love
1	like an old horse in a pound 
1	to solomon sang sheba 
1	planted on his knees 
1	 if you had broached a matter
1	that might the learned please 
1	you had before the sun had thrown
1	our shadows on the ground
1	discovered that my thoughts not it 
1	are but a narrow pound 
1	and kissed her arab eyes 
1	 there s not a man or woman
1	born under the skies
1	dare match in learning with us two 
1	and all day long we have found
1	there s not a thing but love can make
1	the world a narrow pound 
1	i ll say and maybe dream i have drawn content 
1	seeing that time has frozen up the blood 
1	the wick of youth being burned and the oil spent 
1	from beauty that is cast out of a mould
1	in bronze or that in dazzling marble appears 
1	appears and when we have gone is gone again 
1	being more indifferent to our solitude
1	than twere an apparition o heart we are old 
1	the living beauty is for younger men 
1	we cannot pay its tribute of wild tears 
1	i thought no more was needed
1	youth to prolong
1	to keep the body young 
1	oh who could have foretold
1	that the heart grows old 
1	though i have many words 
1	what woman s satisfied 
1	i am no longer faint
1	because at her side 
1	oh who could have foretold
1	that the heart grows old 
1	i have not lost desire
1	but the heart that i had 
1	i thought twould burn my body
1	laid on the death bed 
1	but who could have foretold
1	that the heart grows old 
1	dear fellow artist why so free
1	with every sort of company 
1	with every jack and jill 
1	choose your companions from the best 
1	who draws a bucket with the rest
1	soon topples down the hill 
1	you may that mirror for a school 
1	be passionate not bountiful
1	as common beauties may 
1	who were not born to keep in trim
1	with old ezekiel s cherubim
1	but those of beaujolet 
1	i know what wages beauty gives 
1	how hard a life her servant lives 
1	yet praise the winters gone 
1	there is not a fool can call me friend 
1	and i may dine at journey s end
1	with landor and with donne 
1	my dear my dear i know
1	more than another
1	what makes your heart beat so 
1	not even your own mother
1	can know it as i know 
1	who broke my heart for her
1	when the wild thought 
1	that she denies
1	and has forgot 
1	set all her blood astir
1	and glittered in her eyes 
1	bald heads forgetful of their sins 
1	old learned respectable bald heads
1	edit and annotate the lines
1	that young men tossing on their beds 
1	rhymed out in love s despair
1	to flatter beauty s ignorant ear 
1	they ll cough in the ink to the world s end 
1	wear out the carpet with their shoes
1	earning respect have no strange friend 
1	if they have sinned nobody knows 
1	lord what would they say
1	should their catullus walk that way 
1	 though logic choppers rule the town 
1	and every man and maid and boy
1	has marked a distant object down 
1	an aimless joy is a pure joy 
1	that saw the surges running by 
1	 and wisdom is a butterfly
1	and not a gloomy bird of prey 
1	 if little planned is little sinned
1	but little need the grave distress 
1	what s dying but a second wind 
1	how but in zigzag wantonness
1	could trumpeter michael be so brave 
1	or something of that sort he said 
1	 and if my dearest friend were dead
1	i d dance a measure on his grave 
1	that cry s from the first cuckoo of the year
1	i wished before it ceased 
1	nor bird nor beast
1	could make me wish for anything this day 
1	being old but that the old alone might die 
1	and that would be against god s providence 
1	let the young wish but what has brought you here 
1	never until this moment have we met
1	where my goats browse on the scarce grass or leap
1	from stone to stone 
1	i am looking for strayed sheep 
1	something has troubled me and in my trouble
1	i let them stray i thought of rhyme alone 
1	for rhyme can beat a measure out of trouble
1	and make the daylight sweet once more but when
1	i had driven every rhyme into its place
1	the sheep had gone from theirs 
1	i know right well
1	what turned so good a shepherd from his charge 
1	he that was best in every country sport
1	and every country craft and of us all
1	most courteous to slow age and hasty youth
1	is dead 
1	the boy that brings my griddle cake
1	brought the bare news 
1	he had thrown the crook away
1	and died in the great war beyond the sea 
1	he had often played his pipes among my hills
1	and when he played it was their loneliness 
1	the exultation of their stone that cried
1	under his fingers 
1	i had it from his mother 
1	and his own flock was browsing at the door 
1	how does she bear her grief there is not a shepherd
1	but grows more gentle when he speaks her name 
1	remembering kindness done and how can i 
1	that found when i had neither goat nor grazing
1	new welcome and old wisdom at her fire
1	till winter blasts were gone but speak of her
1	even before his children and his wife 
1	she goes about her house erect and calm
1	between the pantry and the linen chest 
1	or else at meadow or at grazing overlooks
1	her labouring men as though her darling lived
1	but for her grandson now there is no change
1	but such as i have seen upon her face
1	watching our shepherd sports at harvest time
1	when her son s turn was over 
1	sing your song 
1	i too have rhymed my reveries but youth
1	is hot to show whatever it has found
1	and till that s done can neither work nor wait 
1	old goatherds and old goats if in all else
1	youth can excel them in accomplishment 
1	are learned in waiting 
1	you cannot but have seen
1	that he alone had gathered up no gear 
1	set carpenters to work on no wide table 
1	on no long bench nor lofty milking shed
1	as others will when first they take possession 
1	but left the house as in his father s time
1	as though he knew himself as it were a cuckoo 
1	no settled man and now that he is gone
1	there s nothing of him left but half a score
1	of sorrowful austere sweet lofty pipe tunes 
1	you have put the thought in rhyme 
1	i worked all day
1	and when twas done so little had i done
1	that maybe i am sorry in plain prose
1	had sounded better to your mountain fancy 
1	 like the speckled bird that steers
1	thousands of leagues oversea 
1	and runs for a while or a while half flies
1	upon his yellow legs through our meadows 
1	he stayed for a while and we
1	had scarcely accustomed our ears
1	to his speech at the break of day 
1	had scarcely accustomed our eyes
1	to his shape in the lengthening shadows 
1	where the sheep are thrown in the pool 
1	when he vanished from ears and eyes 
1	i had wished a dear thing on that day
1	i heard him first but man is a fool 
1	you sing as always of the natural life 
1	and i that made like music in my youth
1	hearing it now have sighed for that young man
1	and certain lost companions of my own 
1	they say that on your barren mountain ridge
1	you have measured out the road that the soul treads
1	when it has vanished from our natural eyes 
1	that you have talked with apparitions 
1	my daily thoughts since the first stupor of youth
1	have found the path my goats feet cannot find 
1	sing for it may be that your thoughts have plucked
1	some medicable herb to make our grief
1	less bitter 
1	they have brought me from that ridge
1	seed pods and flowers that are not all wild poppy 
1	 he grows younger every second
1	that were all his birthdays reckoned
1	much too solemn seemed 
1	because of what he had dreamed 
1	or the ambitions that he served 
1	much too solemn and reserved 
1	jaunting journeying
1	to his own dayspring 
1	he unpacks the loaded pern
1	of all twas pain or joy to learn 
1	of all that he had made 
1	the outrageous war shall fade 
1	at some old winding whitethorn root
1	he ll practice on the shepherd s flute 
1	or on the close cropped grass
1	court his shepherd lass 
1	or run where lads reform our day time
1	till that is their long shouting play time 
1	knowledge he shall unwind
1	through victories of the mind 
1	till clambering at the cradle side 
1	he dreams himself his mother s pride 
1	all knowledge lost in trance
1	of sweeter ignorance 
1	when i have shut these ewes and this old ram
1	into the fold we ll to the woods and there
1	cut out our rhymes on strips of new torn bark
1	but put no name and leave them at her door 
1	to know the mountain and the valley grieve
1	may be a quiet thought to wife and mother 
1	and children when they spring up shoulder high 
1	when have i last looked on
1	the round green eyes and the long wavering bodies
1	of the dark leopards of the moon 
1	all the wild witches those most noble ladies 
1	for all their broom sticks and their tears 
1	their angry tears are gone 
1	the holy centaurs of the hills are banished 
1	and i have nothing but harsh sun 
1	heroic mother moon has vanished 
1	and now that i have come to fifty years
1	i must endure the timid sun 
1	i would be ignorant as the dawn
1	that has looked down
1	on that old queen measuring a town
1	with the pin of a brooch 
1	or on the withered men that saw
1	from their pedantic babylon
1	the careless planets in their courses 
1	the stars fade out where the moon comes 
1	and took their tablets and did sums 
1	i would be ignorant as the dawn
1	that merely stood rocking the glittering coach
1	above the cloudy shoulders of the horses 
1	i would be for no knowledge is worth a straw 
1	ignorant and wanton as the dawn 
1	may god be praised for woman
1	that gives up all her mind 
1	a man may find in no man
1	a friendship of her kind
1	that covers all he has brought
1	as with her flesh and bone 
1	nor quarrels with a thought
1	because it is not her own 
1	though pedantry denies
1	it s plain the bible means
1	that solomon grew wise
1	while talking with his queens 
1	yet never could although
1	they say he counted grass 
1	count all the praises due
1	when sheba was his lass 
1	when she the iron wrought or
1	when from the smithy fire
1	it shuddered in the water 
1	harshness of their desire
1	that made them stretch and yawn 
1	pleasure that comes with sleep 
1	shudder that made them one 
1	what else he give or keep
1	god grant me no not here 
1	for i am not so bold
1	to hope a thing so dear
1	now i am growing old 
1	but when if the tale s true
1	the pestle of the moon
1	that pounds up all anew
1	brings me to birth again 
1	to find what once i had
1	and know what once i have known 
1	until i am driven mad 
1	sleep driven from my bed 
1	by tenderness and care 
1	pity an aching head 
1	gnashing of teeth despair 
1	and all because of some one
1	perverse creature of chance 
1	and live like solomon
1	that sheba led a dance 
1	although i can see him still 
1	the freckled man who goes
1	to a grey place on a hill
1	in grey connemara clothes
1	at dawn to cast his flies 
1	it s long since i began
1	to call up to the eyes
1	this wise and simple man 
1	all day i d looked in the face
1	what i had hoped twould be
1	to write for my own race
1	and the reality 
1	the living men that i hate 
1	the dead man that i loved 
1	the craven man in his seat 
1	the insolent unreproved 
1	and no knave brought to book
1	who has won a drunken cheer 
1	the witty man and his joke
1	aimed at the commonest ear 
1	the clever man who cries
1	the catch cries of the clown 
1	the beating down of the wise
1	and great art beaten down 
1	maybe a twelvemonth since
1	suddenly i began 
1	in scorn of this audience 
1	and his sun freckled face 
1	and grey connemara cloth 
1	climbing up to a place
1	where stone is dark under froth 
1	and the down turn of his wrist
1	when the flies drop in the stream 
1	a man who does not exist 
1	a man who is but a dream 
1	and cried before i am old
1	i shall have written him one
1	poem maybe as cold
1	and passionate as the dawn 
1	 call down the hawk from the air 
1	let him be hooded or caged
1	till the yellow eye has grown mild 
1	for larder and spit are bare 
1	the old cook enraged 
1	the scullion gone wild 
1	 i will not be clapped in a hood 
1	nor a cage nor alight upon wrist 
1	now i have learnt to be proud
1	hovering over the wood
1	in the broken mist
1	or tumbling cloud 
1	 what tumbling cloud did you cleave 
1	yellow eyed hawk of the mind 
1	last evening that i who had sat
1	should give to my friend
1	a pretence of wit 
1	one had a lovely face 
1	and two or three had charm 
1	but charm and face were in vain
1	because the mountain grass
1	cannot but keep the form
1	where the mountain hare has lain 
1	she is foremost of those that i would hear praised 
1	i have gone about the house gone up and down
1	as a man does who has published a new book
1	or a young girl dressed out in her new gown 
1	and though i have turned the talk by hook or crook
1	until her praise should be the uppermost theme 
1	a woman spoke of some new tale she had read 
1	a man confusedly in a half dream
1	as though some other name ran in his head 
1	she is foremost of those that i would hear praised 
1	i will talk no more of books or the long war
1	but walk by the dry thorn until i have found
1	some beggar sheltering from the wind and there
1	manage the talk until her name come round 
1	if there be rags enough he will know her name
1	and be well pleased remembering it for in the old days 
1	though she had young men s praise and old men s blame 
1	among the poor both old and young gave her praise 
1	 what have i earned for all that work i said 
1	 for all that i have done at my own charge 
1	the daily spite of this unmannerly town 
1	where who has served the most is most defamed 
1	the reputation of his lifetime lost
1	between the night and morning i might have lived 
1	and you know well how great the longing has been 
1	where every day my footfall should have lit
1	in the green shadow of ferrara wall 
1	or climbed among the images of the past 
1	the unperturbed and courtly images 
1	evening and morning the steep street of urbino
1	to where the duchess and her people talked
1	the stately midnight through until they stood
1	in their great window looking at the dawn 
1	i might have had no friend that could not mix
1	courtesy and passion into one like those
1	that saw the wicks grow yellow in the dawn 
1	i might have used the one substantial right
1	my trade allows chosen my company 
1	and chosen what scenery had pleased me best 
1	thereon my phoenix answered in reproof 
1	 the drunkards pilferers of public funds 
1	all the dishonest crowd i had driven away 
1	when my luck changed and they dared meet my face 
1	crawled from obscurity and set upon me
1	those i had served and some that i had fed 
1	yet never have i now nor any time 
1	complained of the people 
1	all i could reply
1	was you that have not lived in thought but deed 
1	can have the purity of a natural force 
1	but i whose virtues are the definitions
1	of the analytic mind can neither close
1	the eye of the mind nor keep my tongue from speech 
1	and yet because my heart leaped at her words 
1	i was abashed and now they come to mind
1	after nine years i sink my head abashed 
1	there is a queen in china or maybe it s in spain 
1	and birthdays and holidays such praises can be heard
1	of her unblemished lineaments a whiteness with no stain 
1	that she might be that sprightly girl who was trodden by a bird 
1	and there s a score of duchesses surpassing womankind 
1	or who have found a painter to make them so for pay
1	and smooth out stain and blemish with the elegance of his mind 
1	i knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day 
1	the young men every night applaud their gaby s laughing eye 
1	and ruth st denis had more charm although she had poor luck 
1	from nineteen hundred nine or ten pavlova s had the cry 
1	and there s a player in the states who gathers up her cloak
1	and flings herself out of the room when juliet would be bride
1	with all a woman s passion a child s imperious way 
1	and there are but no matter if there are scores beside 
1	i knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day 
1	there s margaret and marjorie and dorothy and nan 
1	a daphne and a mary who live in privacy 
1	one s had her fill of lovers another s had but one 
1	another boasts i pick and choose and have but two or three 
1	if head and limb have beauty and the instep s high and light 
1	they can spread out what sail they please for all i have to say 
1	be but the breakers of men s hearts or engines of delight 
1	i knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day 
1	who is my beauty s equal though that my heart denies 
1	but not the exact likeness the simplicity of a child 
1	and that proud look as though she had gazed into the burning sun 
1	i mourn for that most lonely thing and yet god s will be done 
1	i knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day 
1	she might so noble from head
1	to great shapely knees 
1	the long flowing line 
1	have walked to the altar
1	through the holy images
1	at pallas athene s side 
1	or been fit spoil for a centaur
1	drunk with the unmixed wine 
1	there is grey in your hair 
1	young men no longer suddenly catch their breath
1	when you are passing 
1	but maybe some old gaffer mutters a blessing
1	because it was your prayer
1	recovered him upon the bed of death 
1	for your sole sake that all heart s ache have known 
1	and given to others all heart s ache 
1	from meagre girlhood s putting on
1	burdensome beauty for your sole sake
1	heaven has put away the stroke of her doom 
1	so great her portion in that peace you make
1	by merely walking in a room 
1	your beauty can but leave among us
1	vague memories nothing but memories 
1	a young man when the old men are done talking
1	will say to an old man tell me of that lady
1	the poet stubborn with his passion sang us
1	when age might well have chilled his blood 
1	vague memories nothing but memories 
1	but in the grave all all shall be renewed 
1	the certainty that i shall see that lady
1	leaning or standing or walking
1	in the first loveliness of womanhood 
1	and with the fervour of my youthful eyes 
1	has set me muttering like a fool 
1	you are more beautiful than any one
1	and yet your body had a flaw 
1	your small hands were not beautiful 
1	and i am afraid that you will run
1	and paddle to the wrist
1	in that mysterious always brimming lake
1	where those that have obeyed the holy law
1	paddle and are perfect leave unchanged
1	the hands that i have kissed
1	for old sakes sake 
1	the last stroke of midnight dies 
1	all day in the one chair
1	from dream to dream and rhyme to rhyme i have ranged
1	in rambling talk with an image of air 
1	vague memories nothing but memories 
1	others because you did not keep
1	that deep sworn vow have been friends of mine 
1	yet always when i look death in the face 
1	when i clamber to the heights of sleep 
1	or when i grow excited with wine 
1	suddenly i meet your face 
1	this night has been so strange that it seemed
1	as if the hair stood up on my head 
1	from going down of the sun i have dreamed
1	that women laughing or timid or wild 
1	in rustle of lace or silken stuff 
1	climbed up my creaking stair they had read
1	all i had rhymed of that monstrous thing
1	returned and yet unrequited love 
1	they stood in the door and stood between
1	my great wood lecturn and the fire
1	till i could hear their hearts beating 
1	one is a harlot and one a child
1	that never looked upon man with desire 
1	and one it may be a queen 
1	hands do what you re bid 
1	bring the balloon of the mind
1	that bellies and drags in the wind
1	into its narrow shed 
1	come play with me 
1	why should you run
1	through the shaking tree
1	as though i d a gun
1	to strike you dead 
1	when all i would do
1	is to scratch your head
1	and let you go 
1	i think it better that in times like these
1	a poet keep his mouth shut for in truth
1	we have no gift to set a statesman right 
1	he has had enough of meddling who can please
1	a young girl in the indolence of her youth 
1	or an old man upon a winter s night 
1	five and twenty years have gone
1	laid his strong bones down in death
1	by his wife elizabeth
1	in the grey stone tomb he made 
1	and after twenty years they laid
1	in that tomb by him and her 
1	his son george the astrologer 
1	and masons drove from miles away
1	to scatter the acacia spray
1	upon a melancholy man
1	who had ended where his breath began 
1	many a son and daughter lies
1	far from the customary skies 
1	the mall and eades s grammar school 
1	but where is laid the sailor john 
1	that so many lands had known 
1	quiet lands or unquiet seas
1	he never found his rest ashore 
1	moping for one voyage more 
1	where have they laid the sailor john 
1	and yesterday the youngest son 
1	a humorous unambitious man 
1	was buried near the astrologer 
1	and are we now in the tenth year 
1	since he who had been contented long 
1	a nobody in a great throng 
1	decided he would journey home 
1	now that his fiftieth year had come 
1	and mr alfred be again
1	upon the lips of common men
1	who carried in their memory
1	his childhood and his family 
1	at all these death beds women heard
1	a visionary white sea bird
1	lamenting that a man should die 
1	and with that cry i have raised my cry 
1	with the old kindness the old distinguished grace
1	she lies her lovely piteous head amid dull red hair
1	propped upon pillows rouge on the pallor of her face 
1	she would not have us sad because she is lying there 
1	and when she meets our gaze her eyes are laughter lit 
1	her speech a wicked tale that we may vie with her
1	matching our broken hearted wit against her wit 
1	thinking of saints and of petronius arbiter 
1	bring where our beauty lies
1	a new modelled doll or drawing 
1	with a friend s or an enemy s
1	features or maybe showing
1	her features when a tress
1	of dull red hair was flowing
1	over some silken dress
1	cut in the turkish fashion 
1	or it may be like a boy s 
1	we have given the world our passion
1	we have naught for death but toys 
1	because to day is some religious festival
1	heel up and weight on toe must face the wall
1	 pedant in passion learned in old courtesies 
1	vehement and witty she had seemed the venetian lady
1	who had seemed to glide to some intrigue in her red shoes 
1	her domino her panniered skirt copied from longhi 
1	the meditative critic all are on their toes 
1	even our beauty with her turkish trousers on 
1	because the priest must have like every dog his day
1	or keep us all awake with baying at the moon 
1	we and our dolls being but the world were best away 
1	she is playing like a child
1	and penance is the play 
1	fantastical and wild
1	shows her that some one soon
1	will come from the house and say 
1	though play is but half done 
1	 come in and leave the play 
1	she has not grown uncivil
1	as narrow natures would
1	and called the pleasures evil
1	happier days thought good 
1	she knows herself a woman
1	no red and white of a face 
1	or rank raised from a common
1	unreckonable race 
1	and how should her heart fail her
1	or sickness break her will
1	with her dead brother s valour
1	for an example still 
1	when her soul flies to the predestined dancing place
1	 i have no speech but symbol the pagan speech i made
1	amid the dreams of youth let her come face to face 
1	while wondering still to be a shade with grania s shade
1	all but the perils of the woodland flight forgot
1	that made her dermuid dear and some old cardinal
1	pacing with half closed eyelids in a sunny spot
1	who had murmured of giorgione at his latest breath 
1	who have lived in joy and laughed into the face of death 
1	pardon great enemy 
1	without an angry thought
1	we ve carried in our tree 
1	and here and there have bought
1	till all the boughs are gay 
1	and she may look from the bed
1	on pretty things that may
1	please a fantastic head 
1	give her a little grace 
1	what if a laughing eye
1	have looked into your face 
1	it is about to die 
1	on the grey sand beside the shallow stream
1	under your old wind beaten tower where still
1	a lamp burns on beside the open book
1	that michael robartes left you walk in the moon
1	and though you have passed the best of life still trace
1	enthralled by the unconquerable delusion
1	magical shapes 
1	by the help of an image
1	i call to my own opposite summon all
1	that i have handled least least looked upon 
1	and i would find myself and not an image 
1	that is our modern hope and by its light
1	we have lit upon the gentle sensitive mind
1	and lost the old nonchalance of the hand 
1	whether we have chosen chisel pen or brush
1	we are but critics or but half create 
1	timid entangled empty and abashed
1	lacking the countenance of our friends 
1	and yet
1	the chief imagination of christendom
1	dante alighieri so utterly found himself
1	that he has made that hollow face of his
1	more plain to the mind s eye than any face
1	but that of christ 
1	and did he find himself 
1	or was the hunger that had made it hollow
1	a hunger for the apple on the bough
1	most out of reach and is that spectral image
1	the man that lapo and that guido knew 
1	i think he fashioned from his opposite
1	an image that might have been a stony face 
1	staring upon a bedouin s horse hair roof
1	from doored and windowed cliff or half upturned
1	among the coarse grass and the camel dung 
1	he set his chisel to the hardest stone 
1	being mocked by guido for his lecherous life 
1	derided and deriding driven out
1	to climb that stair and eat that bitter bread 
1	he found the unpersuadable justice he found
1	the most exalted lady loved by a man 
1	yet surely there are men who have made their art
1	out of no tragic war lovers of life 
1	impulsive men that look for happiness
1	and sing when they have found it 
1	no not sing 
1	for those that love the world serve it in action 
1	grow rich popular and full of influence 
1	and should they paint or write still it is action 
1	the struggle of the fly in marmalade 
1	the rhetorician would deceive his neighbours 
1	the sentimentalist himself while art
1	is but a vision of reality 
1	what portion in the world can the artist have
1	who has awakened from the common dream
1	but dissipation and despair 
1	and yet
1	no one denies to keats love of the world 
1	remember his deliberate happiness 
1	his art is happy but who knows his mind 
1	i see a schoolboy when i think of him 
1	with face and nose pressed to a sweet shop window 
1	for certainly he sank into his grave
1	his senses and his heart unsatisfied 
1	and made being poor ailing and ignorant 
1	shut out from all the luxury of the world 
1	the coarse bred son of a livery stable keeper 
1	luxuriant song 
1	why should you leave the lamp
1	burning alone beside an open book 
1	and trace these characters upon the sands 
1	a style is found by sedentary toil
1	and by the imitation of great masters 
1	because i seek an image not a book 
1	those men that in their writings are most wise
1	own nothing but their blind stupefied hearts 
1	i call to the mysterious one who yet
1	shall walk the wet sands by the edge of the stream
1	and look most like me being indeed my double 
1	and prove of all imaginable things
1	the most unlike being my anti self 
1	and standing by these characters disclose
1	all that i seek and whisper it as though
1	he were afraid the birds who cry aloud
1	their momentary cries before it is dawn 
1	would carry it away to blasphemous men 
1	god grant a blessing on this tower and cottage
1	and on my heirs if all remain unspoiled 
1	no table or chair or stool not simple enough
1	for shepherd lads in galilee and grant
1	that i myself for portions of the year
1	may handle nothing and set eyes on nothing

1	throughout so many varying centuries 
1	we take it for the norm yet should i dream
1	sinbad the sailor s brought a painted chest 
1	or image from beyond the loadstone mountain
1	that dream is a norm and should some limb of the devil
1	destroy the view by cutting down an ash
1	that shades the road or setting up a cottage
1	planned in a government office shorten his life 
1	manacle his soul upon the red sea bottom 
1	 an old man cocked his ear upon a bridge 
1	he and his friend their faces to the south 
1	had trod the uneven road their boots were soiled 
1	their connemara cloth worn out of shape 
1	they had kept a steady pace as though their beds 
1	despite a dwindling and late risen moon 
1	were distant an old man cocked his ear 
1	what made that sound 
1	a rat or water hen
1	splashed or an otter slid into the stream 
1	we are on the bridge that shadow is the tower 
1	and the light proves that he is reading still 
1	he has found after the manner of his kind 
1	mere images chosen this place to live in
1	because it may be of the candle light
1	from the far tower where milton s platonist
1	sat late or shelley s visionary prince 
1	the lonely light that samuel palmer engraved 
1	an image of mysterious wisdom won by toil 
1	and now he seeks in book or manuscript
1	what he shall never find 
1	why should not you
1	who know it all ring at his door and speak
1	just truth enough to show that his whole life
1	will scarcely find for him a broken crust
1	of all those truths that are your daily bread 
1	and when you have spoken take the roads again 
1	he wrote of me in that extravagant style
1	he had learnt from pater and to round his tale
1	said i was dead and dead i chose to be 
1	sing me the changes of the moon once more 
1	true song though speech mine author sung it me 
1	twenty and eight the phases of the moon

1	twenty and eight and yet but six and twenty
1	the cradles that a man must needs be rocked in 
1	for there s no human life at the full or the dark 
1	from the first crescent to the half the dream
1	but summons to adventure and the man
1	is always happy like a bird or a beast 
1	but while the moon is rounding towards the full
1	he follows whatever whim s most difficult
1	among whims not impossible and though scarred
1	as with the cat o nine tails of the mind

1	the thirteenth moon but sets the soul at war
1	in its own being and when that war s begun
1	there is no muscle in the arm and after
1	under the frenzy of the fourteenth moon
1	the soul begins to tremble into stillness 
1	to die into the labyrinth of itself 
1	sing out the song sing to the end and sing
1	the strange reward of all that discipline 
1	all thought becomes an image and the soul
1	becomes a body that body and that soul
1	too perfect at the full to lie in a cradle 
1	too lonely for the traffic of the world 
1	body and soul cast out and cast away
1	beyond the visible world 
1	all dreams of the soul
1	end in a beautiful man s or woman s body 
1	have you not always known it 
1	the song will have it
1	that those that we have loved got their long fingers
1	from death and wounds or on sinai s top 
1	or from some bloody whip in their own hands 
1	they ran from cradle to cradle till at last
1	their beauty dropped out of the loneliness
1	of body and soul 
1	the lovers heart knows that 
1	it must be that the terror in their eyes
1	is memory or foreknowledge of the hour
1	when all is fed with light and heaven is bare 
1	when the moon s full those creatures of the full
1	are met on the waste hills by country men
1	who shudder and hurry by body and soul
1	estranged amid the strangeness of themselves 
1	caught up in contemplation the mind s eye
1	fixed upon images that once were thought 
1	for separate perfect and immovable
1	images can break the solitude
1	of lovely satisfied indifferent eyes 
1	 and thereupon with aged high pitched voice
1	aherne laughed thinking of the man within 
1	his sleepless candle and laborious pen 
1	and after that the crumbling of the moon 
1	the soul remembering its loneliness
1	shudders in many cradles all is changed 
1	it would be the world s servant and as it serves 
1	choosing whatever task s most difficult
1	among tasks not impossible it takes
1	upon the body and upon the soul
1	the coarseness of the drudge 
1	before the full
1	it sought itself and afterwards the world

1	and never wrote a book your thought is clear 
1	reformer merchant statesman learned man

1	deformed because there is no deformity
1	but saves us from a dream 
1	and what of those
1	that the last servile crescent has set free 
1	because all dark like those that are all light 
1	they are cast beyond the verge and in a cloud 
1	crying to one another like the bats 
1	and having no desire they cannot tell
1	what s good or bad or what it is to triumph
1	at the perfection of one s own obedience 
1	and yet they speak what s blown into the mind 
1	deformed beyond deformity unformed 
1	insipid as the dough before it is baked 
1	they change their bodies at a word 
1	and then 
1	when all the dough has been so kneaded up
1	that it can take what form cook nature fancy
1	the first thin crescent is wheeled round once more 
1	but the escape the song s not finished yet 
1	hunchback and saint and fool are the last crescents 
1	the burning bow that once could shoot an arrow
1	out of the up and down the wagon wheel
1	of beauty s cruelty and wisdom s chatter 
1	out of that raving tide is drawn betwixt
1	deformity of body and of mind 
1	were not our beds far off i d ring the bell 
1	stand under the rough roof timbers of the hall
1	beside the castle door where all is stark
1	austerity a place set out for wisdom
1	that he will never find i d play a part 
1	he would never know me after all these years
1	but take me for some drunken country man 
1	i d stand and mutter there until he caught
1	 hunchback and saint and fool and that they came
1	under the three last crescents of the moon 
1	and then i d stagger out he d crack his wits
1	day after day yet never find the meaning 
1	 and then he laughed to think that what seemed hard
1	should be so simple a bat rose from the hazels
1	and circled round him with its squeaky cry 
1	the light in the tower window was put out 
1	the cat went here and there
1	and the moon spun round like a top 
1	and the nearest kin of the moon
1	the creeping cat looked up 
1	black minnaloushe stared at the moon 
1	for wander and wail as he would
1	the pure cold light in the sky
1	troubled his animal blood 
1	minnaloushe runs in the grass 
1	lifting his delicate feet 
1	do you dance minnaloushe do you dance 
1	when two close kindred meet
1	what better than call a dance 
1	maybe the moon may learn 
1	tired of that courtly fashion 
1	a new dance turn 
1	minnaloushe creeps through the grass
1	from moonlit place to place 
1	the sacred moon overhead
1	has taken a new phase 
1	does minnaloushe know that his pupils
1	will pass from change to change 
1	and that from round to crescent 
1	from crescent to round they range 
1	minnaloushe creeps through the grass
1	alone important and wise 
1	and lifts to the changing moon
1	his changing eyes 
1	stand up and lift your hand and bless
1	a man that finds great bitterness
1	in thinking of his lost renown 
1	a roman caesar is held down
1	under this hump 
1	god tries each man
1	according to a different plan 
1	i shall not cease to bless because
1	i lay about me with the taws
1	that night and morning i may thrash
1	greek alexander from my flesh 
1	augustus caesar and after these
1	that great rogue alcibiades 
1	to all that in your flesh have stood
1	and blessed i give my gratitude 
1	honoured by all in their degrees 
1	but most to alcibiades 
1	a speckled cat and a tame hare
1	eat at my hearthstone
1	and sleep there 
1	and both look up to me alone
1	for learning and defence
1	as i look up to providence 
1	i start out of my sleep to think
1	some day i may forget
1	their food and drink 
1	or the house door left unshut 
1	the hare may run till it s found
1	the horn s sweet note and the tooth of the hound 
1	i bear a burden that might well try
1	men that do all by rule 
1	and what can i
1	that am a wandering witted fool
1	but pray to god that he ease
1	my great responsibilities 
1	i slept on my three legged stool by the fire 
1	the speckled cat slept on my knee 
1	we never thought to enquire
1	where the brown hare might be 
1	and whether the door were shut 
1	who knows how she drank the wind
1	stretched up on two legs from the mat 
1	before she had settled her mind
1	to drum with her heel and to leap 
1	had i but awakened from sleep
1	and called her name she had heard 
1	it may be and had not stirred 
1	that now it may be has found
1	the horn s sweet note and the tooth of the hound 
1	this great purple butterfly 
1	in the prison of my hands 
1	has a learning in his eye
1	once he lived a schoolmaster
1	with a stark denying look 
1	a string of scholars went in fear
1	of his great birch and his great book 
1	like the clangour of a bell 
1	sweet and harsh harsh and sweet 
1	that is how he learnt so well
1	to take the roses for his meat 
1	on the grey rock of cashel the mind s eye
1	has called up the cold spirits that are born
1	when the old moon is vanished from the sky
1	and the new still hides her horn 
1	under blank eyes and fingers never still
1	the particular is pounded till it is man 
1	when had i my own will 
1	oh not since life began 
1	constrained arraigned baffled bent and unbent
1	by these wire jointed jaws and limbs of wood 
1	themselves obedient 
1	knowing not evil and good 
1	obedient to some hidden magical breath 
1	they do not even feel so abstract are they 
1	so dead beyond our death 
1	triumph that we obey 
1	on the grey rock of cashel i suddenly saw
1	a sphinx with woman breast and lion paw 
1	a buddha hand at rest 
1	hand lifted up that blest 
1	and right between these two a girl at play
1	that it may be had danced her life away 
1	for now being dead it seemed
1	that she of dancing dreamed 
1	although i saw it all in the mind s eye
1	there can be nothing solider till i die 
1	i saw by the moon s light
1	now at its fifteenth night 
1	one lashed her tail her eyes lit by the moon
1	gazed upon all things known all things unknown 
1	in triumph of intellect
1	with motionless head erect 
1	that other s moonlit eyeballs never moved 
1	being fixed on all things loved all things unloved 
1	yet little peace he had
1	for those that love are sad 
1	oh little did they care who danced between 
1	and little she by whom her dance was seen
1	so that she danced no thought 
1	body perfection brought 
1	for what but eye and ear silence the mind
1	with the minute particulars of mankind 
1	mind moved yet seemed to stop
1	as twere a spinning top 
1	in contemplation had those three so wrought
1	upon a moment and so stretched it out
1	that they time overthrown 
1	were dead yet flesh and bone 
1	i knew that i had seen had seen at last
1	that girl my unremembering nights hold fast
1	or else my dreams that fly 
1	if i should rub an eye 
1	and yet in flying fling into my meat
1	as though i had been undone
1	by homer s paragon
1	who never gave the burning town a thought 
1	to such a pitch of folly i am brought 
1	being caught between the pull
1	of the dark moon and the full 
1	the commonness of thought and images
1	that have the frenzy of our western seas 
1	thereon i made my moan 
1	and after kissed a stone 
1	and after that arranged it in a song
1	seeing that i ignorant for so long 
1	had been rewarded thus
1	in cormac s ruined house 
1	set up and electrotyped published november 
1	to a friend whose work has come to nothing
1	beggar to beggar cried
1	the hour before dawn
1	to a child dancing in the wind
1	that the night come
1	a woman homer sung
1	the fascination of what s difficult
1	the coming of wisdom with time
1	on hearing that the students of our new university
1	have joined the ancient order of hibernians
1	upon a house shaken by the land agitation
1	a friend s illness
1	all things can tempt me
1	the young man s song
1	 in dreams begins responsibility 
1	 how am i fallen from myself for a long time now 
1	 i have not seen the prince of chang in my dreams 
1	 pardon old fathers if you still remain 
1	 somewhere in ear shot for the story s end 
1	 old dublin merchant free of ten and four 
1	 or trading out of galway into spain 
1	 and country scholar robert emmet s friend 
1	 a hundred year old memory to the poor 
1	 traders or soldiers who have left me blood 
1	 that has not passed through any huxter s loin 
1	 pardon and you that did not weigh the cost 
1	 old butlers when you took to horse and stood 
1	 beside the brackish waters of the boyne 
1	 till your bad master blenched and all was lost 
1	 you merchant skipper that leaped overboard 
1	 after a ragged hat in biscay bay 
1	 you most of all silent and fierce old man 
1	 because you were the spectacle that stirred 
1	 my fancy and set my boyish lips to say 
1	 only the wasteful virtues earn the sun 
1	 pardon that for a barren passion s sake 
1	 although i have come close on forty nine 
1	 i have no child i have nothing but a book 
1	 nothing but that to prove your blood and mine 
1	 poets with whom i learned my trade 
1	 here s an old story i ve re made 
1	 imagining twould better please 
1	 your ears than stories now in fashion 
1	 though you may think i waste my breath 
1	 pretending that there can be passion 
1	 that has more life in it than death 
1	 and though at bottling of your wine 
1	 the bow legged goban had no say 
1	 the moral s yours because it s mine 
1	when cups went round at close of day 
1	is not that how good stories run 
1	somewhere within some hollow hill 
1	if books speak truth in slievenamon 
1	but let that be the gods were still
1	and sleepy having had their meal 
1	and smoky torches made a glare
1	on painted pillars on a deal
1	of fiddles and of flutes hung there
1	by the ancient holy hands that brought them
1	from murmuring murias on cups 
1	old goban hammered them and wrought them 
1	and put his pattern round their tops
1	to hold the wine they buy of him 
1	but from the juice that made them wise
1	all those had lifted up the dim
1	imaginations of their eyes 
1	for one that was like woman made
1	before their sleepy eyelids ran
1	and trembling with her passion said 
1	 come out and dig for a dead man 
1	who s burrowing somewhere in the ground 
1	and mock him to his face and then
1	hollo him on with horse and hound 
1	for he is the worst of all dead men 
1	 we should be dazed and terror struck 
1	 if we but saw in dreams that room 
1	 those wine drenched eyes and curse our luck 
1	 that emptied all our days to come 
1	 i knew a woman none could please 
1	 because she dreamed when but a child 
1	 of men and women made like these 
1	 and after when her blood ran wild 
1	 had ravelled her own story out 
1	 and said in two or in three years 
1	 i need must marry some poor lout 
1	 and having said it burst in tears 
1	 since tavern comrades you have died 
1	 maybe your images have stood 
1	 mere bone and muscle thrown aside 
1	 before that roomful or as good 
1	 you had to face your ends when young 
1	 twas wine or women or some curse 
1	 but never made a poorer song 
1	 that you might have a heavier purse 
1	 nor gave loud service to a cause 
1	 that you might have a troop of friends 
1	 you kept the muses sterner laws 
1	 and unrepenting faced your ends 
1	 and therefore earned the right and yet 
1	 dowson and johnson most i praise 
1	 to troop with those the world s forgot 
1	 and copy their proud steady gaze 
1	 the danish troop was driven out
1	between the dawn and dusk she said 
1	 although the event was long in doubt 
1	although the king of ireland s dead
1	and half the kings before sundown
1	all was accomplished 
1	 when this day
1	murrough the king of ireland s son 
1	foot after foot was giving way 
1	he and his best troops back to back
1	had perished there but the danes ran 
1	stricken with panic from the attack 
1	the shouting of an unseen man 
1	and being thankful murrough found 
1	led by a footsole dipped in blood
1	that had made prints upon the ground 
1	where by old thorn trees that man stood 
1	and though when he gazed here and there 
1	he had but gazed on thorn trees spoke 
1	 who is the friend that seems but air
1	and yet could give so fine a stroke 
1	thereon a young man met his eye 
1	who said because she held me in
1	her love and would not have me die 
1	rock nurtured aoife took a pin 
1	and pushing it into my shirt 
1	promised that for a pin s sake 
1	no man should see to do me hurt 
1	but there it s gone i will not take
1	the fortune that had been my shame
1	seeing king s son what wounds you have 
1	 twas roundly spoke but when night came
1	he had betrayed me to his grave 
1	for he and the king s son were dead 
1	i d promised him two hundred years 
1	and when for all i d done or said 
1	and these immortal eyes shed tears 
1	he claimed his country s need was most 
1	i d save his life yet for the sake
1	of a new friend he has turned a ghost 
1	what does he care if my heart break 
1	that we may harry him thereon
1	she cast herself upon the ground
1	and rent her clothes and made her moan 
1	 why are they faithless when their might
1	is from the holy shades that rove
1	the grey rock and the windy light 
1	why should the faithfullest heart most love
1	the bitter sweetness of false faces 
1	why must the lasting love what passes 
1	why are the gods by men betrayed 
1	but thereon every god stood up
1	with a slow smile and without sound 
1	and stretching forth his arm and cup
1	to where she moaned upon the ground 
1	suddenly drenched her to the skin 
1	and she with goban s wine adrip 
1	no more remembering what had been 
1	stared at the gods with laughing lip 
1	 i have kept my faith though faith was tried 
1	 to that rock born rock wandering foot 
1	 and the world s altered since you died 
1	 and i am in no good repute 
1	 with the loud host before the sea 
1	 that think sword strokes were better meant 
1	 than lover s music let that be 
1	 so that the wandering foot s content 
1	king eochaid came at sundown to a wood
1	westward of tara hurrying to his queen
1	he had out ridden his war wasted men
1	that with empounded cattle trod the mire 
1	and where beech trees had mixed a pale green light
1	with the ground ivy s blue he saw a stag
1	whiter than curds its eyes the tint of the sea 
1	because it stood upon his path and seemed
1	more hands in height than any stag in the world
1	he sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth
1	upon his trembling horse then drove the spur 
1	but the stag stooped and ran at him and passed 
1	rending the horse s flank king eochaid reeled
1	then drew his sword to hold its levelled point
1	against the stag when horn and steel were met
1	the horn resounded as though it had been silver 
1	a sweet miraculous terrifying sound 
1	horn locked in sword they tugged and struggled there
1	as though a stag and unicorn were met
1	until at last the double horns drawn backward 
1	butted below the single and so pierced
1	the entrails of the horse dropping his sword
1	king eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands
1	and stared into the sea green eye and so
1	hither and thither to and fro they trod
1	till all the place was beaten into mire 
1	the strong thigh and the agile thigh were met 
1	the hands that gathered up the might of the world 
1	and hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed
1	amid the elaborate wilderness of the air 
1	through bush they plunged and over ivied root 
1	and where the stone struck fire while in the leaves
1	a squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out 
1	but when at last he forced those sinewy flanks
1	against a beech bole he threw down the beast
1	and knelt above it with drawn knife on the instant
1	it vanished like a shadow and a cry
1	so mournful that it seemed the cry of one
1	who had lost some unimaginable treasure
1	wandered between the blue and the green leaf
1	and climbed into the air crumbling away 
1	till all had seemed a shadow or a vision
1	but for the trodden mire the pool of blood 
1	the disembowelled horse 
1	king eochaid ran 
1	toward peopled tara nor stood to draw his breath
1	until he came before the painted wall 
1	the posts of polished yew circled with bronze 
1	of the great door but though the hanging lamps
1	showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows 
1	nor door nor mouth nor slipper made a noise 
1	nor on the ancient beaten paths that wound
1	from well side or from plough land was there noise 
1	and there had been no sound of living thing
1	before him or behind but that far off
1	on the horizon edge bellowed the herds 
1	knowing that silence brings no good to kings 
1	and mocks returning victory he passed
1	between the pillars with a beating heart
1	and saw where in the midst of the great hall
1	pale faced alone upon a bench edain
1	sat upright with a sword before her feet 
1	her hands on either side had gripped the bench 
1	her eyes were cold and steady her lips tight 
1	some passion had made her stone hearing a foot
1	she started and then knew whose foot it was 
1	but when he thought to take her in his arms
1	she motioned him afar and rose and spoke 
1	 i have sent among the fields or to the woods
1	the fighting men and servants of this house 
1	for i would have your judgment upon one
1	who is self accused if she be innocent
1	she would not look in any known man s face
1	till judgment has been given and if guilty 
1	will never look again on known man s face 
1	and at these words he paled as she had paled 
1	knowing that he should find upon her lips
1	the meaning of that monstrous day 
1	then she 
1	 you brought me where your brother ardan sat
1	always in his one seat and bid me care him
1	through that strange illness that had fixed him there 
1	and should he die to heap his burial mound
1	and carve his name in ogham eochaid said 
1	 he lives he lives and is a healthy man 
1	 while i have him and you it matters little
1	what man you have lost what evil you have found 
1	 i bid them make his bed under this roof
1	and carried him his food with my own hands 
1	and so the weeks passed by but when i said
1	 what is this trouble he would answer nothing 
1	though always at my words his trouble grew 
1	and i but asked the more till he cried out 
1	weary of many questions there are things
1	then i replied although you hide a secret 
1	hopeless and dear or terrible to think on 
1	speak it that i may send through the wide world
1	for medicine thereon he cried aloud 
1	 day after day you question me and i 
1	because there is such a storm amid my thoughts
1	i shall be carried in the gust command 
1	forbid beseech and waste my breath then i 
1	 although the thing that you have hid were evil 
1	the speaking of it could be no great wrong 
1	and evil must it be if done twere worse
1	than mound and stone that keep all virtue in 
1	and loosen on us dreams that waste our life 
1	shadows and shows that can but turn the brain 
1	but finding him still silent i stooped down
1	and whispering that none but he should hear 
1	said if a woman has put this on you 
1	my men whether it please her or displease 
1	and though they have to cross the loughlan waters
1	and take her in the middle of armed men 
1	shall make her look upon her handiwork 
1	that she may quench the rick she has fired and though
1	she may have worn silk clothes or worn a crown 
1	she ll not be proud knowing within her heart
1	that our sufficient portion of the world
1	is that we give although it be brief giving 
1	happiness to children and to men 
1	then he driven by his thought beyond his thought 
1	and speaking what he would not though he would 
1	sighed you even you yourself could work the cure 
1	and at those words i rose and i went out
1	and for nine days he had food from other hands 
1	and for nine days my mind went whirling round
1	the one disastrous zodiac muttering
1	that the immedicable mound s beyond
1	our questioning beyond our pity even 
1	but when nine days had gone i stood again
1	before his chair and bending down my head
1	told him that when orion rose and all
1	the women of his household were asleep 
1	to go for hope would give his limbs the power 
1	to an old empty woodman s house that s hidden
1	close to a clump of beech trees in the wood
1	westward of tara there to await a friend
1	that could as he had told her work his cure
1	and would be no harsh friend 
1	when night had deepened 
1	i groped my way through boughs and over roots 
1	till oak and hazel ceased and beech began 
1	and found the house a sputtering torch within 
1	and stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins
1	ardan and though i called to him and tried
1	to shake him out of sleep i could not rouse him 
1	i waited till the night was on the turn 
1	then fearing that some labourer on his way
1	to plough or pasture land might see me there 
1	went out 
1	among the ivy covered rocks 
1	as on the blue light of a sword a man
1	who had unnatural majesty and eyes
1	like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods 
1	stood on my path trembling from head to foot
1	i gazed at him like grouse upon a kite 
1	but with a voice that had unnatural music 
1	 a weary wooing and a long he said 
1	 speaking of love through other lips and looking
1	under the eyelids of another for it was my craft
1	that put a passion in the sleeper there 
1	and when i had got my will and drawn you here 
1	where i may speak to you alone my craft
1	sucked up the passion out of him again
1	and left mere sleep he ll wake when the sun wakes 
1	push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes 
1	and wonder what has ailed him these twelve months 
1	i cowered back upon the wall in terror 
1	but that sweet sounding voice ran on woman 
1	i was your husband when you rode the air 
1	danced in the whirling foam and in the dust 
1	in days you have not kept in memory 
1	being betrayed into a cradle and i come
1	that i may claim you as my wife again 
1	i was no longer terrified his voice
1	had half awakened some old memory 
1	yet answered him i am king eochaid s wife
1	and with him have found every happiness
1	women can find with a most masterful voice 
1	that made the body seem as it were a string
1	under a bow he cried what happiness
1	can lovers have that know their happiness
1	our sudden palaces in the still air
1	pleasure itself can bring no weariness 
1	nor can time waste the cheek nor is there foot
1	that has grown weary of the whirling dance 
1	nor an unlaughing mouth but mine that mourns 
1	among those mouths that sing their sweethearts praise 
1	your empty bed how should i love i answered 
1	 were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed
1	and shown my husband sleeping there i have sighed 
1	 your strength and nobleness will pass away 
1	or how should love be worth its pains were it not
1	that when he has fallen asleep within my arms 
1	being wearied out i love in man the child 
1	what can they know of love that do not know
1	she builds her nest upon a narrow ledge
1	above a windy precipice then he 
1	 seeing that when you come to the death bed
1	you must return whether you would or no 
1	this human life blotted from memory 
1	why must i live some thirty forty years 
1	alone with all this useless happiness 
1	thereon he seized me in his arms but i
1	thrust him away with both my hands and cried 
1	 never will i believe there is any change
1	can blot out of my memory this life
1	sweetened by death but if i could believe
1	that were a double hunger in my lips
1	for what is doubly brief 
1	and now the shape 
1	my hands were pressed to vanished suddenly 
1	i staggered but a beech tree stayed my fall 
1	and clinging to it i could hear the cocks
1	crow upon tara 
1	king eochaid bowed his head
1	and thanked her for her kindness to his brother 
1	for that she promised and for that refused 
1	thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds
1	rose round the walls and through the bronze ringed door
1	jostled and shouted those war wasted men 
1	and in the midst king eochaid s brother stood 
1	he d heard that din on the horizon s edge
1	and ridden towards it being ignorant 
1	you gave but will not give again
1	until enough of paudeen s pence
1	by biddy s halfpennies have lain
1	to be some sort of evidence 
1	before you ll put your guineas down 
1	that things it were a pride to give
1	are what the blind and ignorant town
1	imagines best to make it thrive 
1	what cared duke ercole that bid
1	his mummers to the market place 
1	what th onion sellers thought or did
1	so that his plautus set the pace
1	for the italian comedies 
1	and guidobaldo when he made
1	that grammar school of courtesies
1	where wit and beauty learned their trade
1	upon urbino s windy hill 
1	had sent no runners to and fro
1	that he might learn the shepherds will 
1	and when they drove out cosimo 
1	indifferent how the rancour ran 
1	he gave the hours they had set free
1	to michelozzo s latest plan
1	whence turbulent italy should draw
1	delight in art whose end is peace 
1	in logic and in natural law
1	by sucking at the dugs of greece 
1	your open hand but shows our loss 
1	for he knew better how to live 
1	let paudeens play at pitch and toss 
1	look up in the sun s eye and give
1	what the exultant heart calls good
1	that some new day may breed the best
1	because you gave not what they would
1	but the right twigs for an eagle s nest 
1	what need you being come to sense 
1	but fumble in a greasy till
1	and add the halfpence to the pence
1	and prayer to shivering prayer until
1	you have dried the marrow from the bone 
1	for men were born to pray and save 
1	romantic ireland s dead and gone 
1	it s with o leary in the grave 
1	yet they were of a different kind
1	the names that stilled your childish play 
1	they have gone about the world like wind 
1	but little time had they to pray
1	for whom the hangman s rope was spun 
1	and what god help us could they save 
1	romantic ireland s dead and gone 
1	it s with o leary in the grave 
1	was it for this the wild geese spread
1	the grey wing upon every tide 
1	for this that all that blood was shed 
1	for this edward fitzgerald died 
1	all that delirium of the brave 
1	romantic ireland s dead and gone 
1	it s with o leary in the grave 
1	yet could we turn the years again 
1	and call those exiles as they were 
1	in all their loneliness and pain
1	you d cry some woman s yellow hair
1	has maddened every mother s son 
1	they weighed so lightly what they gave 
1	but let them be they re dead and gone 
1	they re with o leary in the grave 
1	now all the truth is out 
1	be secret and take defeat
1	from any brazen throat 
1	for how can you compete 
1	being honour bred with one
1	who were it proved he lies 
1	were neither shamed in his own
1	nor in his neighbours eyes 
1	bred to a harder thing
1	than triumph turn away
1	and like a laughing string
1	whereon mad fingers play
1	amid a place of stone 
1	be secret and exult 
1	because of all things known
1	that is most difficult 
1	indignant at the fumbling wits the obscure spite
1	of our old paudeen in his shop i stumbled blind
1	among the stones and thorn trees under morning light 
1	until a curlew cried and in the luminous wind
1	a curlew answered and suddenly thereupon i thought
1	that on the lonely height where all are in god s eye 
1	there cannot be confusion of our sound forgot 
1	a single soul that lacks a sweet crystaline cry 
1	if you have revisited the town thin shade 
1	whether to look upon your monument
1	 i wonder if the builder has been paid 
1	or happier thoughted when the day is spent
1	to drink of that salt breath out of the sea
1	when grey gulls flit about instead of men 
1	and the gaunt houses put on majesty 
1	let these content you and be gone again 
1	for they are at their old tricks yet 
1	a man
1	of your own passionate serving kind who had brought
1	in his full hands what had they only known 
1	had given their children s children loftier thought 
1	sweeter emotion working in their veins
1	like gentle blood has been driven from the place 
1	and insult heaped upon him for his pains
1	 all rights reserved 
1	and for his open handedness disgrace 
1	an old foul mouth that slandered you had set
1	the pack upon him 
1	go unquiet wanderer 
1	and gather the glasnevin coverlet
1	about your head till the dust stops your ear 
1	the time for you to taste of that salt breath
1	and listen at the corners has not come 
1	you had enough of sorrow before death 
1	away away you are safer in the tomb 
1	we have cried in our despair
1	that men desert 
1	for some trivial affair
1	or noisy insolent sport 
1	beauty that we have won
1	from bitterest hours 
1	yet we had we walked within
1	those topless towers
1	where helen walked with her boy 
1	had given but as the rest
1	of the men and women of troy 
1	a word and a jest 
1	once when midnight smote the air 
1	eunuchs ran through hell and met
1	from thoroughfare to thoroughfare 
1	while that great juan galloped by 
1	and like these to rail and sweat
1	staring upon his sinewy thigh 
1	 though to my feathers in the wet 
1	 i have stood here from break of day 
1	 i have not found a thing to eat 
1	 for only rubbish comes my way 
1	 am i to live on lebeen lone 
1	 muttered the old crane of gort 
1	 for all my pains on lebeen lone 
1	king guari walked amid his court
1	the palace yard and river side
1	and there to three old beggars said 
1	 you that have wandered far and wide
1	can ravel out what s in my head 
1	do men who least desire get most 
1	or get the most who most desire 
1	a beggar said they get the most
1	whom man or devil cannot tire 
1	and what could make their muscles taut
1	unless desire had made them so 
1	but guari laughed with secret thought 
1	 if that be true as it seems true 
1	one of you three is a rich man 
1	for he shall have a thousand pounds
1	who is first asleep if but he can
1	sleep before the third noon sounds 
1	and thereon merry as a bird 
1	with his old thoughts king guari went
1	from river side and palace yard
1	and left them to their argument 
1	 and if i win one beggar said 
1	 though i am old i shall persuade
1	a pretty girl to share my bed 
1	the second i shall learn a trade 
1	the third i ll hurry to the course
1	among the other gentlemen 
1	and lay it all upon a horse 
1	the second i have thought again 
1	a farmer has more dignity 
1	one to another sighed and cried 
1	the exorbitant dreams of beggary 
1	that idleness had borne to pride 
1	sang through their teeth from noon to noon 
1	and when the second twilight brought
1	the frenzy of the beggars moon
1	they closed their blood shot eyes for naught 
1	one beggar cried you re shamming sleep 
1	and thereupon their anger grew
1	till they were whirling in a heap 
1	they d mauled and bitten the night through
1	or sat upon their heels to rail 
1	and when old guari came and stood
1	before the three to end this tale 
1	they were commingling lice and blood 
1	 time s up he cried and all the three
1	with blood shot eyes upon him stared 
1	 time s up he cried and all the three
1	fell down upon the dust and snored 
1	 maybe i shall be lucky yet 
1	 now they are silent said the crane 
1	 though to my feathers in the wet 
1	 i ve stood as i were made of stone 
1	 and seen the rubbish run about 
1	 it s certain there are trout somewhere 
1	 and maybe i shall take a trout 
1	 if but i do not seem to care 
1	three old hermits took the air
1	by a cold and desolate sea 
1	first was muttering a prayer 
1	second rummaged for a flea 
1	on a windy stone the third 
1	giddy with his hundredth year 
1	sang unnoticed like a bird 
1	 though the door of death is near
1	and what waits behind the door 
1	three times in a single day
1	i though upright on the shore 
1	fall asleep when i should pray 
1	so the first but now the second 
1	 we re but given what we have earned
1	when all thoughts and deeds are reckoned 
1	so it s plain to be discerned
1	that the shades of holy men 
1	who have failed being weak of will 
1	pass the door of birth again 
1	and are plagued by crowds until
1	they ve the passion to escape 
1	moaned the other they are thrown
1	into some most fearful shape 
1	but the second mocked his moan 
1	 they are not changed to anything 
1	having loved god once but maybe 
1	to a poet or a king
1	or a witty lovely lady 
1	while he d rummaged rags and hair 
1	caught and cracked his flea the third 
1	giddy with his hundredth year
1	sang unnoticed like a bird 
1	 time to put off the world and go somewhere
1	and find my health again in the sea air 
1	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
1	 and make my soul before my pate is bare 
1	 and get a comfortable wife and house
1	to rid me of the devil in my shoes 
1	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
1	 and the worse devil that is between my thighs 
1	 and though i d marry with a comely lass 
1	she need not be too comely let it pass 
1	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
1	 but there s a devil in a looking glass 
1	 nor should she be too rich because the rich
1	are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch 
1	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
1	 and cannot have a humorous happy speech 
1	 and there i ll grow respected at my ease 
1	and hear amid the garden s nightly peace 
1	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
1	 the wind blown clamor of the barnacle geese 
1	 the man that i praise 
1	cries out the empty well 
1	 lives all his days
1	where a hand on the bell
1	can call the milch cows
1	to the comfortable door of his house 
1	dry stones in a well 
1	 the man that i praise 
1	cries out the leafless tree 
1	 has married and stays
1	by an old hearth and he
1	on naught has set store
1	but children and dogs on the floor 
1	a withered tree 
1	as i came over windy gap
1	they threw a halfpenny into my cap 
1	for i am running to paradise 
1	and all that i need do is to wish
1	and somebody puts his hand in the dish
1	to throw me a bit of salted fish 
1	and there the king is but as the beggar 
1	my brother mourteen is worn out
1	with skelping his big brawling lout 
1	and i am running to paradise 
1	a poor life do what he can 
1	and though he keep a dog and a gun 
1	a serving maid and a serving man 
1	and there the king is but as the beggar 
1	poor men have grown to be rich men 
1	and rich men grown to be poor again 
1	and i am running to paradise 
1	and many a darling wit s grown dull
1	that tossed a bare heel when at school 
1	now it has filled an old sock full 
1	and there the king is but as the beggar 
1	the wind is old and still at play
1	while i must hurry upon my way 
1	for i am running to paradise 
1	yet never have i lit on a friend
1	to take my fancy like the wind
1	that nobody can buy or bind 
1	and there the king is but as the beggar 
1	a one legged one armed one eyed man 
1	a bundle of rags upon a crutch 
1	stumbled on windy cruachan
1	cursing the wind it was as much
1	as the one sturdy leg could do
1	to keep him upright while he cursed 
1	he had counted where long years ago
1	queen maeve s nine maines had been nursed 
1	a pair of lapwings one old sheep
1	and not a house to the plain s edge 
1	when close to his right hand a heap
1	of grey stones and a rocky ledge
1	reminded him that he could make 
1	if he but shifted a few stones 
1	a shelter till the daylight broke 
1	but while he fumbled with the stones
1	they toppled over were it not
1	i have a lucky wooden shin
1	i had been hurt and toppling brought
1	before his eyes where stones had been 
1	a dark deep hole in the rock s face 
1	he gave a gasp and thought to run 
1	being certain it was no right place
1	that s stuffed with all that s old and bad 
1	and yet stood still because inside
1	he had seen a red haired jolly lad
1	in some outlandish coat beside
1	a ladle and a tub of beer 
1	plainly no phantom by his look 
1	so with a laugh at his own fear
1	he crawled into that pleasant nook 
1	young red head stretched himself to yawn
1	and murmured may god curse the night
1	that s grown uneasy near the dawn
1	so that it seems even i sleep light 
1	and who are you that wakens me 
1	has one of maeve s nine brawling sons
1	grown tired of his own company 
1	but let him keep his grave for once
1	i have to find the sleep i have lost 
1	and then at last being wide awake 
1	 i took you for a brawling ghost 
1	say what you please but from day break
1	i ll sleep another century 
1	the beggar deaf to all but hope
1	went down upon a hand and knee
1	and took the wooden ladle up
1	and would have dipped it in the beer
1	but the other pushed his hand aside 
1	 before you have dipped it in the beer
1	that sacred goban brewed he cried 
1	 i d have assurance that you are able
1	to value beer i will have no fool
1	dipping his nose into my ladle
1	because he has stumbled on this hole
1	in the bad hour before the dawn 
1	if you but drink that beer and say
1	i will sleep until the winter s gone 
1	or maybe to midsummer day
1	you will sleep that length and at the first
1	i waited so for that or this 
1	because the weather was a cursed
1	or i had no woman there to kiss 
1	and slept for half a year or so 
1	but year by year i found that less
1	gave me such pleasure i d forgo
1	even a half hour s nothingness 
1	and when at one year s end i found
1	i had not waked a single minute 
1	i chose this burrow under ground 
1	i will sleep away all time within it 
1	my sleep were now nine centuries
1	but for those mornings when i find
1	the lapwing at their foolish cries
1	and the sheep bleating at the wind
1	as when i also played the fool 
1	the beggar in a rage began
1	upon his hunkers in the hole 
1	 it s plain that you are no right man
1	to mock at everything i love
1	as if it were not worth the doing 
1	i d have a merry life enough
1	if a good easter wind were blowing 
1	and though the winter wind is bad
1	i should not be too down in the mouth
1	for anything you did or said
1	if but this wind were in the south 
1	but the other cried you long for spring
1	or that the wind would shift a point
1	and do not know that you would bring 
1	if time were suppler in the joint 
1	neither the spring nor the south wind
1	but the hour when you shall pass away
1	and leave no smoking wick behind 
1	for all life longs for the last day
1	and there s no man but cocks his ear
1	to know when michael s trumpet cries
1	that flesh and bone may disappear 
1	and souls as if they were but sighs 
1	and there be nothing but god left 
1	but i alone being blessed keep
1	like some old rabbit to my cleft
1	and wait him in a drunken sleep 
1	he dipped his ladle in the tub
1	and drank and yawned and stretched him out 
1	the other shouted you would rob
1	my life of every pleasant thought
1	and every comfortable thing
1	and so take that and that thereon
1	he gave him a great pummelling 
1	but might have pummelled at a stone
1	for all the sleeper knew or cared 
1	and after heaped the stones again
1	and cursed and prayed and prayed and cursed 
1	 oh god if he got loose and then
1	in fury and in panic fled
1	and gave god thanks that overhead
1	the clouds were brightening with the dawn 
1	 song from an unfinished play 
1	my mother dandled me and sang 
1	 how young it is how young 
1	and made a golden cradle
1	that on a willow swung 
1	 he went away my mother sang 
1	 when i was brought to bed 
1	and all the while her needle pulled
1	the gold and silver thread 
1	she pulled the thread and bit the thread
1	and made a golden gown 
1	and wept because she had dreamt that i
1	was born to wear a crown 
1	 when she was got my mother sang 
1	 i heard a sea mew cry 
1	and saw a flake of the yellow foam
1	that dropped upon my thigh 
1	how therefore could she help but braid
1	the gold into my hair 
1	and dream that i should carry
1	the golden top of care 
1	hope that you may understand 
1	what can books of men that wive
1	in a dragon guarded land 
1	paintings of the dolphin drawn
1	sea nymphs in their pearly waggons
1	do but awake a hope to live
1	that had gone
1	with the dragons 
1	toil and grow rich 
1	what s that but to lie
1	with a foul witch
1	and after drained dry 
1	to be brought
1	to the chamber where
1	lies one long sought
1	with despair 
1	what s riches to him
1	that has made a great peacock
1	with the pride of his eye 
1	the wind beaten stone grey 
1	and desolate three rock
1	would nourish his whim 
1	amid wet rocks and heather 
1	his ghost will be gay
1	adding feather to feather
1	for the pride of his eye 
1	pour wine and dance if manhood still have pride 
1	bring roses if the rose be yet in bloom 
1	the cataract smokes upon the mountain side 
1	our father rosicross is in his tomb 
1	pull down the blinds bring fiddle and clarionet
1	that there be no foot silent in the room
1	nor mouth from kissing nor from wine unwet 
1	our father rosicross is in his tomb 
1	in vain in vain the cataract still cries
1	the everlasting taper lights the gloom 
1	all wisdom shut into his onyx eyes
1	our father rosicross sleeps in his tomb 
1	dance there upon the shore 
1	what need have you to care
1	for wind or water s roar 
1	and tumble out your hair
1	that the salt drops have wet 
1	being young you have not known
1	the fool s triumph nor yet
1	love lost as soon as won 
1	nor the best labourer dead
1	and all the sheaves to bind 
1	what need have you to dread
1	the monstrous crying of wind 
1	has no one said those daring
1	kind eyes should be more learn d 
1	or warned you how despairing
1	the moths are when they are burned 
1	i could have warned you but you are young 
1	so we speak a different tongue 
1	o you will take whatever s offered
1	and dream that all the world s a friend 
1	suffer as your mother suffered 
1	be as broken in the end 
1	but i am old and you are young 
1	and i speak a barbarous tongue 
1	the moments passed as at a play 
1	i had the wisdom love brings forth 
1	i had my share of mother wit
1	and yet for all that i could say 
1	and though i had her praise for it 
1	a cloud blown from the cut throat north
1	suddenly hid love s moon away 
1	believing every word i said
1	i praised her body and her mind
1	till pride had made her eyes grow bright 
1	and pleasure made her cheeks grow red 
1	and vanity her footfall light 
1	yet we for all that praise could find
1	nothing but darkness overhead 
1	we sat as silent as a stone 
1	we knew though she d not said a word 
1	that even the best of love must die 
1	and had been savagely undone
1	were it not that love upon the cry
1	of a most ridiculous little bird
1	tore from the clouds his marvellous moon 
1	although crowds gathered once if she but showed her face 
1	and even old men s eyes grew dim this hand alone 
1	babbling of fallen majesty records what s gone 
1	the lineaments a heart that laughter has made sweet 
1	these these remain but i record what s gone a crowd
1	will gather and not know it walks the very street
1	whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud 
1	now must i these three praise 
1	three women that have wrought
1	what joy is in my days 
1	one that no passing thought 
1	nor those unpassing cares 
1	no not in these fifteen
1	many times troubled years 
1	could ever come between
1	heart and delighted heart 
1	and one because her hand
1	had strength that could unbind
1	what none can understand 
1	what none can have and thrive 
1	youth s dreamy load till she
1	so changed me that i live
1	labouring in ecstasy 
1	and what of her that took
1	all till my youth was gone
1	with scarce a pitying look 
1	how should i praise that one 
1	when day begins to break
1	i count my good and bad 
1	being wakeful for her sake 
1	remembering what she had 
1	what eagle look still shows 
1	while up from my heart s root
1	so great a sweetness flows
1	i shake from head to foot 
1	suddenly i saw the cold and rook delighting heaven
1	that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice 
1	and thereupon imagination and heart were driven
1	so wild that every casual thought of that and this
1	vanished and left but memories that should be out of season
1	with the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago 
1	and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason 
1	until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro 
1	riddled with light ah when the ghost begins to quicken 
1	confusion of the death bed over is it sent
1	out naked on the roads as the books say and stricken
1	by the injustice of the skies for punishment 
1	she lived in storm and strife 
1	her soul had such desire
1	for what proud death may bring
1	that it could not endure
1	the common good of life 
1	but lived as twere a king
1	that packed his marriage day
1	with banneret and pennon 
1	trumpet and kettledrum 
1	and the outrageous cannon 
1	to bundle time away
1	that the night come 
1	being out of heart with government
1	i took a broken root to fling
1	where the proud wayward squirrel went 
1	taking delight that he could spring 
1	and he with that low whinnying sound
1	that is like laughter sprang again
1	and so to the other tree at a bound 
1	nor the tame will nor timid brain 
1	bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb
1	and threw him up to laugh on the bough 
1	no government appointed him 
1	now as at all times i can see in the mind s eye 
1	in their stiff painted clothes the pale unsatisfied ones
1	appear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky
1	with all their ancient faces like rain beaten stones 
1	and all their helms of silver hovering side by side 
1	and all their eyes still fixed hoping to find once more 
1	being by calvary s turbulence unsatisfied 
1	the uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor 
1	a doll in the doll maker s house
1	looks at the cradle and balls 
1	 that is an insult to us 
1	but the oldest of all the dolls
1	who had seen being kept for show 
1	generations of his sort 
1	out screams the whole shelf although
1	there s not a man can report
1	evil of this place 
1	the man and the woman bring
1	hither to our disgrace 
1	a noisy and filthy thing 
1	hearing him groan and stretch
1	the doll maker s wife is aware
1	her husband has heard the wretch 
1	and crouched by the arm of his chair 
1	she murmurs into his ear 
1	head upon shoulder leant 
1	 my dear my dear oh dear 
1	it was an accident 
1	i made my song a coat
1	covered with embroideries
1	out of old mythologies
1	from heel to throat 
1	but the fools caught it 
1	wore it in the world s eye
1	as though they d wrought it 
1	song let them take it
1	for there s more enterprise
1	in walking naked 
1	 while i from that reed throated whisperer 
1	 who comes at need although not now as once 
1	 a clear articulation in the air 
1	 but inwardly surmise companions 
1	 beyond the fling of the dull ass s hoof 
1	 ben jonson s phrase and find when june is come 
1	 at kyle na no under that ancient roof 
1	 a sterner conscience and a friendlier home 
1	 i can forgive even that wrong of wrongs 
1	 those undreamt accidents that have made me 
1	 seeing that fame has perished this long while 
1	 being but a part of ancient ceremony 
1	 notorious till all my priceless things 
1	 are but a post the passing dogs defile 
1	i swayed upon the gaudy stern
1	the butt end of a steering oar 
1	and everywhere that i could turn
1	men ran upon the shore 
1	and though i would have hushed the crowd
1	there was no mother s son but said 
1	 what is the figure in a shroud
1	upon a gaudy bed 
1	and fishes bubbling to the brim
1	cried out upon that thing beneath 
1	 it had such dignity of limb 
1	by the sweet name of death 
1	though i d my finger on my lip 
1	what could i but take up the song 
1	and fish and crowd and gaudy ship
1	cried out the whole night long 
1	crying amid the glittering sea 
1	naming it with ecstatic breath 
1	because it had such dignity
1	by the sweet name of death 
1	if any man drew near
1	when i was young 
1	i thought he holds her dear 
1	and shook with hate and fear 
1	but oh twas bitter wrong
1	if he could pass her by
1	with an indifferent eye 
1	whereon i wrote and wrought 
1	and now being grey 
1	i dream that i have brought
1	to such a pitch my thought
1	that coming time can say 
1	 he shadowed in a glass
1	what thing her body was 
1	for she had fiery blood
1	when i was young 
1	and trod so sweetly proud
1	as twere upon a cloud 
1	a woman homer sung 
1	that life and letters seem
1	but an heroic dream 
1	i had this thought awhile ago 
1	 my darling cannot understand
1	what i have done or what would do
1	in this blind bitter land 
1	and i grew weary of the sun
1	until my thoughts cleared up again 
1	remembering that the best i have done
1	was done to make it plain 
1	that every year i have cried at length
1	my darling understands it all 
1	because i have come into my strength 
1	and words obey my call 
1	that had she done so who can say
1	what would have shaken from the sieve 
1	i might have thrown poor words away
1	and been content to live 
1	why should i blame her that she filled my days
1	with misery or that she would of late
1	have taught to ignorant men most violent ways 
1	or hurled the little streets upon the great 
1	had they but courage equal to desire 
1	what could have made her peaceful with a mind
1	that nobleness made simple as a fire 
1	with beauty like a tightened bow a kind
1	that is not natural in an age like this 
1	being high and solitary and most stern 
1	why what could she have done being what she is 
1	was there another troy for her to burn 
1	some may have blamed you that you took away
1	the verses that could move them on the day
1	when the ears being deafened the sight of the eyes blind
1	with lightning you went from me and i could find
1	nothing to make a song about but kings 
1	helmets and swords and half forgotten things
1	that were like memories of you but now
1	we ll out for the world lives as long ago 
1	and while we re in our laughing weeping fit 
1	hurl helmets crowns and swords into the pit 
1	but dear cling close to me since you were gone 
1	my barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone 
1	 would it were anything but merely voice 
1	the no king cried who after that was king 
1	because he had not heard of anything
1	that balanced with a word is more than noise 
1	yet old romance being kind let him prevail
1	somewhere or somehow that i have forgot 
1	though he d but cannon whereas we that had thought
1	to have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
1	have been defeated by that pledge you gave
1	in momentary anger long ago 
1	and i that have not your faith how shall i know
1	that in the blinding light beyond the grave
1	we ll find so good a thing as that we have lost 
1	the hourly kindness the day s common speech 
1	the habitual content of each with each
1	when neither soul nor body has been crossed 
1	ah that time could touch a form
1	that could show what homer s age
1	bred to be a hero s wage 
1	 were not all her life but storm 
1	would not painters paint a form
1	of such noble lines i said 
1	 such a delicate high head 
1	all that sternness amid charm 
1	all that sweetness amid strength 
1	ah but peace that comes at length 
1	came when time had touched her form 
1	o heart be at peace because
1	nor knave nor dolt can break
1	what s not for their applause 
1	being for a woman s sake 
1	enough if the work has seemed 
1	so did she your strength renew 
1	a dream that a lion had dreamed
1	till the wilderness cried aloud 
1	a secret between you two 
1	between the proud and the proud 
1	what still you would have their praise 
1	but here s a haughtier text 
1	the labyrinth of her days
1	that her own strangeness perplexed 
1	and how what her dreaming gave
1	earned slander ingratitude 
1	from self same dolt and knave 
1	aye and worse wrong than these 
1	yet she singing upon her road 
1	half lion half child is at peace 
1	the fascination of what s difficult
1	has dried the sap out of my veins and rent
1	spontaneous joy and natural content
1	out of my heart there s something ails our colt
1	that must as if it had not holy blood 
1	nor on an olympus leaped from cloud to cloud 
1	shiver under the lash strain sweat and jolt
1	as though it dragged road metal my curse on plays
1	that have to be set up in fifty ways 
1	on the day s war with every knave and dolt 
1	theatre business management of men 
1	i swear before the dawn comes round again
1	i ll find the stable and pull out the bolt 
1	wine comes in at the mouth
1	and love comes in at the eye 
1	that s all we shall know for truth
1	before we grow old and die 
1	i lift the glass to my mouth 
1	i look at you and i sigh 
1	though leaves are many the root is one 
1	through all the lying days of my youth
1	i swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun 
1	now i may wither into the truth 
1	where where but here have pride and truth 
1	that long to give themselves for wage 
1	to shake their wicked sides at youth
1	restraining reckless middle age 
1	you say as i have often given tongue
1	in praise of what another s said or sung 
1	 twere politic to do the like by these 
1	but have you known a dog to praise his fleas 
1	 put off that mask of burning gold
1	with emerald eyes 
1	 o no my dear you make so bold
1	to find if hearts be wild and wise 
1	and yet not cold 
1	 i would but find what s there to find 
1	love or deceit 
1	 it was the mask engaged your mind 
1	and after set your heart to beat 
1	not what s behind 
1	 but lest you are my enemy 
1	i must enquire 
1	 o no my dear let all that be 
1	what matter so there is but fire
1	in you in me 
1	how should the world be luckier if this house 
1	where passion and precision have been one
1	time out of mind became too ruinous
1	to breed the lidless eye that loves the sun 
1	and the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow
1	where wings have memory of wings and all
1	that comes of the best knit to the best although
1	mean roof trees were the sturdier for its fall 
1	how should their luck run high enough to reach
1	the gifts that govern men and after these
1	to gradual time s last gift a written speech
1	wrought of high laughter loveliness and ease 
1	 imitated from ronsard 
1	dear craoibhin aoibhin look into our case 
1	when we are high and airy hundreds say
1	that if we hold that flight they ll leave the place 
1	while those same hundreds mock another day
1	because we have made our art of common things 
1	so bitterly you d dream they longed to look
1	all their lives through into some drift of wings 
1	you ve dandled them and fed them from the book
1	and know them to the bone impart to us 
1	we ll keep the secret a new trick to please 
1	is there a bridle for this proteus
1	that turns and changes like his draughty seas 
1	or is there none most popular of men 
1	but when they mock us that we mock again 
1	these are the clouds about the fallen sun 
1	the majesty that shuts his burning eye 
1	the weak lay hand on what the strong has done 
1	till that be tumbled that was lifted high
1	and discord follow upon unison 
1	and all things at one common level lie 
1	and therefore friend if your great race were run
1	and these things came so much the more thereby
1	have you made greatness your companion 
1	although it be for children that you sigh 
1	these are the clouds about the fallen sun 
1	the majesty that shuts his burning eye 
1	there where the course is 
1	delight makes all of the one mind 
1	the riders upon the galloping horses 
1	the crowd that closes in behind 
1	we too had good attendance once 
1	hearers and hearteners of the work 
1	aye horsemen for companions 
1	before the merchant and the clerk
1	breathed on the world with timid breath 
1	sing on sometime and at some new moon 
1	we ll learn that sleeping is not death 
1	hearing the whole earth change its tune 
1	its flesh being wild and it again
1	crying aloud as the race course is 
1	and we find hearteners among men
1	that ride upon horses 
1	sickness brought me this
1	thought in that scale of his 
1	why should i be dismayed
1	though flame had burned the whole
1	world as it were a coal 
1	now i have seen it weighed
1	against a soul 
1	all things can tempt me from this craft of verse 
1	one time it was a woman s face or worse 
1	the seeming needs of my fool driven land 
1	now nothing but comes readier to the hand
1	than this accustomed toil when i was young 
1	i had not given a penny for a song
1	did not the poet sing it with such airs
1	that one believed he had a sword upstairs 
1	yet would be now could i but have my wish 
1	i whispered i am too young 
1	and then i am old enough 
1	wherefore i threw a penny
1	to find out if i might love 
1	 go and love go and love young man 
1	if the lady be young and fair 
1	ah penny brown penny brown penny 
1	i am looped in the loops of her hair 
1	oh love is the crooked thing 
1	there is nobody wise enough
1	to find out all that is in it 
1	for he would be thinking of love
1	till the stars had run away 
1	and the shadows eaten the moon 
1	ah penny brown penny brown penny 
1	one cannot begin it too soon 
1	bridget his wife 
1	teigue a fool 
1	he said we might choose the subject for the lesson 
1	there is none of us wise enough to do that 
1	i will question him 
1	give me a penny 
1	give me a penny 
1	 taking up book how heavy it is 
1	make him spread out his arms 
1	give me a penny 
1	is that the right cry for an eagle cock 
1	that s it and then he cannot blame us for the choice 
1	the master has come 
1	will anybody give a penny to a fool 
1	a bracket on the wall one pupil puts the book before him 
1	we have chosen the passage for the lesson master there are two
1	lambing time there 
1	i knew that it was folly but they would have it 
1	had we not better say we picked it by chance 
1	no he would say we were children still 
1	the beggar who wrote that on babylon wall meant that there is a
1	spiritual kingdom that cannot be seen or known till the faculties
1	let s come away and find a better subject 
1	and maybe now you ll let me choose 
1	were it but true twould alter everything
1	until the stream of the world had changed its course 
1	and that and all our thoughts had run
1	into some cloudy thunderous spring
1	they dream to be its source 
1	aye to some frenzy of the mind 
1	and all that we have done would be undone 
1	our speculation but as the wind 
1	i have dreamed it twice 
1	something has troubled him 
1	twice have i dreamed it in a morning dream 
1	now nothing serves my pupils but to come
1	with a like thought reason is growing dim 
1	a moment more and frenzy will beat his drum
1	and laugh aloud and scream 
1	and i must dance in the dream 
1	no no but it is like a hawk a hawk of the air 
1	it has swooped down and this swoop makes the third 
1	and what can i but tremble like a bird 
1	give me a penny 
1	won t you give me a penny 
1	such a great wise teacher will not refuse a penny to a fool 
1	o i know i know i know what i have seen 
1	that s foolish advice for a wise man to give 
1	what are the shears for 
1	i won t tell you if i told you you would drive them away 
1	drive them away who would i drive away 
1	i won t tell you 
1	not if i give you a penny 
1	not if i give you two pennies 
1	three pennies 
1	four and i will tell you 
1	a strange place that to fish in 
1	i have seen plenty of angels 
1	no no you have not 
1	i knew you would drive them away 
1	i had forgotten who i spoke to 
1	well there are your four pennies fool you are called 
1	and all day long they cry come hither fool 
1	or else it s fool be gone 
1	or fool stand there 
1	or fool go sit in the corner 
1	and all the while
1	what were they all but fools before i came 
1	what are they now but mirrors that seem men 
1	because of my image fool hold up your head 
1	what foolish stories they have told of the ghosts
1	that fumbled with the clothes upon the bed 
1	or creaked and shuffled in the corridor 
1	or else if they were pious bred 
1	of angels from the skies 
1	that coming through the door 
1	or it may be standing there 
1	would solidly out stare
1	the steadiest eyes with their unnatural eyes 
1	aye on a man s own floor 
1	man can be found with the right voice and may wear a
1	little golden domino and a halo made of metal or the
1	whole face may be a beautiful mask in which case the
1	last sentence on page should not be spoken 
1	yet it is strange the strangest thing i have known 
1	that i should still be haunted by the notion
1	that there s a crisis of the spirit wherein
1	we get new sight and that they know some trick
1	to turn our thoughts for their own ends to frenzy 
1	why do you put your finger to your lip 
1	and creep away 
1	 wise man sees angel what are you who are you 
1	i think i saw some like you in my dreams 
1	when but a child that thing about your head 
1	that brightness in your hair that flowery branch 
1	but i have done with dreams i have done with dreams 
1	i am the crafty one that you have called 
1	how that i called 
1	i am the messenger 
1	what message could you bring to one like me 
1	angel turning the hour glass 
1	that you will die when the last grain of sand
1	has fallen through this glass 
1	i have a wife 
1	children and pupils that i cannot leave 
1	why must i die my time is far away 
1	you have to die because no soul has passed
1	the heavenly threshold since you have opened school 
1	but grass grows there and rust upon the hinge 
1	and they are lonely that must keep the watch 
1	and whither shall i go when i am dead 
1	you have denied there is a purgatory 
1	therefore that gate is closed you have denied
1	there is a heaven and so that gate is closed 
1	where then for i have said there is no hell 
1	hell is the place of those who have denied 
1	they find there what they planted and what dug 
1	and wander there and drift and never cease
1	wailing for substance 
1	pardon me blessed angel 
1	i have denied and taught the like to others 
1	but how could i believe before my sight
1	had come to me 
1	it is too late for pardon 
1	had i but met your gaze as now i met it 
1	but how can you that live but where we go
1	in the uncertainty of dizzy dreams
1	know why we doubt parting sickness and death 
1	the rotting of the grass tempest and drouth 
1	these are the messengers that came to me 
1	why are you silent you carry in your hands
1	god s pardon and you will not give it me 
1	why are you silent were i not afraid 
1	i d kiss your hands no no the hem of your dress 
1	only when all the world has testified 
1	may soul confound it crying out in joy 
1	and laughing on its lonely precipice 
1	what s dearth and death and sickness to the soul
1	that knows no virtue but itself nor could it 
1	so trembling with delight and mother naked 
1	live unabashed if the arguing world stood by 
1	it is as hard for you to understand
1	why we have doubted as it is for us
1	to banish doubt what folly have i said 
1	there can be nothing that you do not know 
1	give me a year a month a week a day 
1	i would undo what i have done an hour 
1	give me until the sand has run in the glass 
1	though you may not undo what you have done 
1	i have this power if you but find one soul 
1	before the sands have fallen that still believes 
1	one fish to lie and spawn among the stones
1	till the great fisher s net is full again 
1	you may the purgatorial fire being passed 
1	spring to your peace 
1	 who stole your wits away
1	and where are they gone 
1	my pupils come 
1	before you have begun to climb the sky
1	i shall have found that soul they say they doubt 
1	but what their mothers dinned into their ears
1	cannot have been so lightly rooted up 
1	besides i can disprove what i once proved 
1	and yet give me some thought some argument 
1	more mighty than my own 
1	farewell farewell 
1	for i am weary of the weight of time 
1	some of his pupils come in at the other side of the stage 
1	master master you must choose the subject 
1	the pupils may have little cushions on which presently
1	they seat themselves 
1	here is a subject where have the fool s wits gone singing 
1	 who dragged your wits away
1	where no one knows 
1	or have they run off
1	on their own pair of shoes 
1	give me a penny 
1	the master will find your wits 
1	and when they are found you must not beg for pennies 
1	they are hidden somewhere in the badger s hole 
1	but you must carry an old candle end
1	if you would find them 
1	they are up above the clouds 
1	give me a penny give me a penny 
1	first pupil singing 
1	 i ll find your wits again 
1	come for i saw them roll 
1	to where old badger mumbles
1	in the black hole 
1	second pupil singing 
1	 no but an angel stole them
1	the night that you were born 
1	and now they are but a rag 
1	on the moon s horn 
1	be silent 
1	can you not see that he is troubled 
1	what do you think of when alone at night 
1	do not the things your mothers spoke about 
1	before they took the candle from the bedside 
1	rush up into the mind and master it 
1	till you believe in them against your will 
1	second pupil to first pupil 
1	you answer for us 
1	third pupil in a whisper to first pupil 
1	be careful what you say 
1	if he persuades you to an argument 
1	he will but turn us all to mockery 
1	we had no minds until you made them for us 
1	our bodies only were our mothers work 
1	you answer with incredible things it is certain
1	that there is one though it may be but one 
1	believes in god and in some heaven and hell 
1	in all those things we put into our prayers 
1	we thought those things before our minds were born 
1	but that was long ago we are not children 
1	you are afraid to tell me what you think
1	because i am hot and angry when i am crossed 
1	i do not blame you for it but have no fear 
1	for if there s one that sat on smiling there 
1	as though my arguments were sweet as milk
1	yet found them bitter i will thank him for it 
1	if he but speak his mind 
1	there is no one master 
1	there is not one but found them sweet as milk 
1	the things that have been told us in our childhood
1	are not so fragile 
1	we are no longer children 
1	we all believe in you and in what you have taught 
1	all all all all in you nothing but you 
1	i have deceived you where shall i go for words 
1	i have no thoughts my mind has been swept bare 
1	the messengers that stand in the fiery cloud 
1	fling themselves out if we but dare to question 
1	and after that the babylonian moon
1	blots all away 
1	first pupil to other pupils 
1	i take his words to mean
1	that visionaries and martyrs when they are raised
1	above translunary things and there enlightened 
1	as the contention is may lose the light 
1	and flounder in their speech when the eyes open 
1	how well he imitates their trick of speech 
1	their air of mystery 
1	their empty gaze 
1	as though they d looked upon some winged thing 
1	and would not condescend to mankind after 
1	master we have all learnt that truth is learnt
1	when the intellect s deliberate and cold 
1	as it were a polished mirror that reflects
1	an unchanged world and not when the steel melts 
1	bubbling and hissing till there s naught but fume 
1	when it is melted when it all fumes up 
1	they walk as when beside those three in the furnace
1	the form of the fourth 
1	master there s none among us
1	that has not heard your mockery of these 
1	or thoughts like these and we have not forgot 
1	something incredible has happened some one has come
1	suddenly like a grey hawk out of the air 
1	and all that i declared untrue is true 
1	first pupil to other pupils 
1	you d think the way he says it that he felt it 
1	there s not a mummer to compare with him 
1	he s something like a man 
1	give us some proof 
1	what proof have i to give but that an angel
1	an instant ago was standing on that spot 
1	you dreamed it 
1	i was awake as i am now 
1	first pupil to the others 
1	i may be dreaming now for all i know 
1	he wants to show we have no certain proof
1	of anything in the world 
1	there is this proof
1	that shows we are awake we have all one world
1	while every dreamer has a world of his own 
1	and sees what no one else can 
1	teigue sees angels 
1	so when the master says he has seen an angel 
1	he may have seen one 
1	both may still be dreamers 
1	unless it s proved the angels were alike 
1	what sort are the angels teigue 
1	that will prove nothing 
1	unless we are sure prolonged obedience
1	has made one angel like another angel
1	as they were eggs 
1	the master s silent now 
1	for he has found that to dispute with us 
1	seeing that he has taught us what we know 
1	is but to reason with himself let us away 
1	and find if there is one believer left 
1	yes yes find me but one that still believes
1	the things that we were told when we were children 
1	he ll mock and maul him 
1	from the first i knew
1	he wanted somebody to argue with 
1	i have no reason left all dark all dark 
1	here master is the very man you want 
1	he said when we were studying the book 
1	that maybe after all the monks were right 
1	and you mistaken and if we but gave him time 
1	he d prove that it was so 
1	i never said it 
1	dear friend dear friend do you believe in god 
1	master they have invented this to mock me 
1	you are afraid of me 
1	they know well master 
1	that all i said was but to make them argue 
1	they ve pushed me in to make a mock of me 
1	because they knew i could take either side
1	and beat them at it 
1	if you believe in god 
1	you are my soul s one friend 
1	mistress or wife
1	can give us but our good or evil luck
1	amid the howling world but you shall give
1	eternity and those sweet throated things
1	that drift above the moon 
1	how strange he is 
1	the angel that stood there upon that spot 
1	said that my soul was lost unless i found out
1	one that believed 
1	cease mocking at me master 
1	for i am certain that there is no god
1	nor immortality and they that said it
1	made a fantastic tale from a starved dream
1	to plague our hearts will that content you master 
1	the giddy glass is emptier every moment 
1	and you stand there debating laughing and wrangling 
1	out of my sight out of my sight i say 
1	i ll call my wife for what can women do 
1	that carry us in the darkness of their bodies 
1	but mock the reason that lets nothing grow
1	unless it grow in light bridget bridget 
1	a woman never ceases to believe 
1	say what we will bridget come quickly bridget 
1	from her arms which are covered with flour 
1	wife what do you believe in tell me the truth 
1	and not as is the habit with you all 
1	something you think will please me do you pray 
1	sometimes when you re alone in the house do you pray 
1	do you believe in god 
1	oh a good wife only believes in what her husband tells her 
1	but sometimes when the children are asleep
1	and i am in the school do you not think
1	about the martyrs and the saints and the angels 
1	and all the things that you believed in once 
1	my god my god i will go out myself 
1	my pupils said that they would find a man
1	whose faith i never shook they may have found him 
1	therefore i will go out but if i go 
1	the glass will let the sands run out unseen 
1	i cannot go i cannot leave the glass 
1	go call my pupils i can explain all now 
1	only when all our hold on life is troubled 
1	only in spiritual terror can the truth
1	come through the broken mind as the pease burst
1	out of a broken pease cod 
1	say to them 
1	that nature would lack all in her most need 
1	could not the soul find truth as in a flash 
1	upon the battle field or in the midst
1	of overwhelming waves and say to them 
1	but no they would but answer as i bid 
1	you want somebody to get up an argument with 
1	look out and see if there is any one
1	there in the street i cannot leave the glass 
1	for somebody might shake it and the sand
1	if it were shaken might run down on the instant 
1	go out and find if they have found a man
1	who did not understand me when i taught 
1	or did not listen 
1	strange that i should be blind to the great secret 
1	and that so simple a man might write it out
1	upon a blade of grass or bit of rush
1	with naught but berry juice and laugh to himself
1	writing it out because it was so simple 
1	then i am lost indeed 
1	children children 
1	your father wants you run to him 
1	come to me children do not be afraid 
1	i want to know if you believe in heaven 
1	god or the soul no do not tell me yet 
1	you need not be afraid i shall be angry 
1	say what you please so that it is your thought 
1	i wanted you to know before you spoke 
1	that i shall not be angry 
1	we have not forgotten father 
1	go to your mother go yet do not go 
1	and yet because the sands are running out 
1	i have but a moment to show it all in children 
1	the sap would die out of the blades of grass
1	had they a doubt they understand it all 
1	being the fingers of god s certainty 
1	yet can but make their sign into the air 
1	but could they find their tongues they d show it all 
1	but what am i to say that am but one 
1	when they are millions and they will not speak 
1	but they are gone what made them run away 
1	look at me tell me if my face is changed 
1	is there a notch of the fiend s nail upon it
1	already is it terrible to sight 
1	because the moment s near 
1	i dare not look 
1	i dare not know the moment when they come 
1	no no i dare not covers glass 
1	will there be a footfall 
1	or will there be a sort of rending sound 
1	or else a cracking as though an iron claw
1	had gripped the threshold stone 
1	what are you doing 
1	what are you doing that for 
1	i am blowing the dandelion to find out what hour it is 
1	you have heard everything and that is why
1	you d find what hour it is you d find that out 
1	that you may look upon a fleet of devils
1	dragging my soul away you shall not stop 
1	i will have no one here when they come in 
1	i will have no one sitting there no one 
1	and yet and yet there is something strange about you 
1	i half remember something what is it 
1	do you believe in god and in the soul 
1	tell me quickly 
1	speak speak for underneath the cover there
1	the sand is running from the upper glass 
1	and when the last grain s through i shall be lost 
1	there s but one pinch of sand and i am lost
1	if you are not he i seek 
1	o what a lot the fool knows but he says nothing 
1	yes i remember now you spoke of angels 
1	you said but now that you had seen an angel 
1	you are the one i seek and i am saved 
1	the last hope is gone 
1	and now that it s too late i see it all 
1	we perish into god and sink away
1	into reality the rest s a dream 
1	i know enough that know god s will prevails 
1	be silent may god s will prevail on the instant 
1	although his will be my eternal pain 
1	i have no question 
1	it is enough i know what fixed the station
1	of star and cloud 
1	and knowing all i cry
1	that what so god has willed
1	on the instant be fulfilled 
1	though that be my damnation 
1	the stream of the world has changed its course 
1	and with the stream my thoughts have run
1	into some cloudy thunderous spring
1	that is its mountain source 
1	aye to some frenzy of the mind 
1	for all that we have done s undone 
1	our speculation but as the wind 
1	 i hear the wind a blow
1	i hear the grass a grow 
1	and all that i know i know 
1	but i will not speak i will run away 
1	the fable for this poem came into my head while i was giving some

1	here and there the nationalist newspapers and the young ireland

1	i still had hopes my later hours to crown 
1	amidst these humble bowers to lay me down 
1	to husband out life s taper at the close
1	and keep the flame from wasting by repose 
1	i still had hopes for pride attends us still

1	and tell of all i felt and all i saw 
1	and as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue 
1	pants to the place from whence at first he flew 
1	i still had hopes my long vexations past 
1	here to return and die at home at last 
1	near yonder copse where once the garden smil d 
1	and still where many a garden flower grows wild 
1	there where a few torn shrubs the place disclose 
1	the village preacher s modest mansion rose 
1	a man he was to all the country dear 
1	and passing rich with forty pounds a year 
1	remote from towns he ran his godly race 
1	nor e er had changed nor wish d to change his place 
1	unpractis d he to fawn or seek for power 
1	by doctrines fashion d to the varying hour 
1	far other aims his heart had learn d to prize 
1	more skill d to raise the wretched than to rise 
1	his house was known to all the vagrant train

1	whose beard descending swept his aged breast 
1	the ruined spendthrift now no longer proud 
1	claimed kindred there and had his claims allow d 
1	the broken soldier kindly bade to stay 
1	sat by his fire and talked the night away 
1	wept o er his wounds or tales of sorrow done 
1	shouldered his crutch and showed how fields were won 
1	pleased with his guests the good man learned to glow 
1	and quite forgot their vices in their woe 
1	careless their merits or their faults to scan 
1	he pity gave ere charity began 
1	if sadly thinking with spirits sinking 
1	could more than drinking my cares compose 
1	a cure for sorrow from sighs i d borrow 
1	and hope to morrow would end my woes 
1	but as in wailing there s nought availing 
1	and death unfailing will strike the blow 
1	then for that reason and for a season 
1	let us be merry before we go 
1	to joy a stranger a wayworn ranger 
1	in every danger my course i ve run 
1	now hope all ending and death befriending 
1	his last aid lending my cares are done 
1	no more a rover or hapless lover 
1	my griefs are over my glass runs low 
1	then for that reason and for a season 
1	let us be merry before we go 
1	thou canst not boast of fortune s store 
1	my love while me they wealthy call 
1	but i was glad to find thee poor 
1	for with my heart i d give thee all 
1	and then the grateful youth shall own 
1	i loved him for himself alone 
1	but when his worth my hand shall gain 
1	no word or look of mine shall show
1	that i the smallest thought retain
1	of what my bounty did bestow 
1	yet still his grateful heart shall own 
1	i loved him for himself alone 
1	my love still i think that i see her once more 
1	but alas she has left me her loss to deplore 
1	my own little kathleen my poor little kathleen 
1	her hair glossy black her eyes were dark blue 
1	her colour still changing her smiles ever new 
1	so pretty was kathleen my sweet little kathleen 
1	she milked the dun cow that ne er offered to stir 
1	though wicked to all it was gentle to her 
1	so kind was my kathleen my poor little kathleen 
1	she sat at the door one cold afternoon 
1	to hear the wind blow and to gaze on the moon 
1	so pensive was kathleen my poor little kathleen 
1	cold was the night breeze that sighed round her bower 
1	it chilled my poor kathleen she drooped from that hour 
1	and i lost my poor kathleen my own little kathleen 
1	the bird of all birds that i love the best 
1	is the robin that in the churchyard builds his nest 
1	for he seems to watch kathleen hops lightly o er kathleen 
1	the groves of blarney
1	they look so charming
1	down by the purling
1	of sweet silent brooks 
1	being banked with posies
1	that spontaneous grow there 
1	planted in order
1	by the sweet rock close 
1	 tis there s the daisy
1	and the sweet carnation 
1	the blooming pink 
1	and the rose so fair 
1	the daffydowndilly 
1	likewise the lily 
1	all flowers that scent
1	the sweet fragrant air 
1	that owns this station 
1	or queen helen fair 
1	there s no commander
1	in all the nation 
1	for emulation 
1	can with her compare 
1	such walls surround her
1	that no nine pounder
1	could dare to plunder
1	her place of strength 
1	her he did pommell 
1	and made a breach
1	in her battlement 
1	there s gravel walks there
1	for speculation
1	and conversation
1	in sweet solitude 
1	 tis there the lover
1	may hear the dove or
1	the gentle plover
1	in the afternoon 
1	and if a lady
1	would be so engaging
1	as to walk alone in
1	those shady bowers 
1	 tis there the courtier
1	he may transport her
1	into some fort or
1	all under ground 
1	for tis there s a cave where
1	no daylight enters 
1	but cats and badgers
1	are for ever bred 
1	being mossed by nature 
1	that makes it sweeter
1	than a coach and six or
1	a feather bed 
1	 tis there the lake is 
1	well stored with perches 
1	and comely eels in
1	the verdant mud 
1	beside the leeches 
1	and groves of beeches 
1	standing in order
1	for to guard the flood 
1	there s statues gracing
1	this noble place in 
1	all heathen gods
1	and nymphs so fair 
1	all standing naked
1	in the open air 
1	so now to finish
1	this brave narration 
1	which my poor genii
1	could not entwine 
1	but were i homer
1	 tis in every feature
1	i would make it shine 
1	oft in the stilly night 
1	ere slumber s chain has bound me 
1	fond memory brings the light
1	of other days around me 
1	the smiles the tears
1	of boyhood s years 
1	the words of love then spoken 
1	the eyes that shone
1	now dimm d and gone 
1	the cheerful homes now broken 
1	then in the stilly night 
1	ere slumber s chain hath bound me 
1	sad memory brings the light
1	of other days around me 
1	when i remember all
1	the friends so linked together
1	i ve seen around me fall
1	like leaves in wintry weather 
1	i feel like one
1	who treads alone
1	some banquet hall deserted 
1	whose lights are fled 
1	whose garlands dead 
1	and all but he departed 
1	then in the stilly night 
1	ere slumber s chain hath bound me 
1	sad memory brings the light
1	of other days around me 
1	at the mid hour of night when stars are weeping i fly
1	to the lone vale we loved when life shone warm in thine eye 
1	and i think oft if spirits can steal from the regions of air
1	to revisit past scenes of delight thou wilt come to me there 
1	and tell me our love is remembered even in the sky 
1	then i sing the wild song it once was rapture to hear
1	when our voices commingling breathed like one on the ear 
1	and as echo far off through the vale my sad orison rolls 
1	i think o my love tis thy voice from the kingdom of souls
1	faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear 
1	not a drum was heard not a funeral note 
1	as his corse to the rampart we hurried 
1	not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
1	o er the grave where our hero we buried 
1	we buried him darkly at dead of night 
1	the sods with our bayonets turning 
1	by the struggling moonbeam s misty light 
1	and the lantern dimly burning 
1	no useless coffin enclosed his breast 
1	not in sheet or in shroud we wound him 
1	but he lay like a warrior taking his rest 
1	with his martial cloak around him 
1	few and short were the prayers we said 
1	and we spoke not a word of sorrow 
1	but we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead 
1	and we bitterly thought of the morrow 
1	we thought as we hollow d his narrow bed 
1	and smooth d down his lonely pillow 
1	that the foe and the stranger would tread o er his head 
1	and we far away on the billow 
1	lightly they ll talk of the spirit that s gone 
1	and o er his cold ashes upbraid him 
1	but little he ll reck if they let him sleep on
1	in the grave where a briton has laid him 
1	but half of our heavy task was done 
1	when the clock struck the hour for retiring 
1	and we heard the distant and random gun
1	that the foe was sullenly firing 
1	slowly and sadly we laid him down 
1	from the field of his fame fresh and gory 
1	we carved not a line and we raised not a stone 
1	but we left him alone in his glory 
1	how hard is my fortune 
1	and vain my repining 
1	the strong rope of fate
1	for this young neck is twining 
1	my strength is departed 
1	my cheek sunk and sallow 
1	while i languish in chains 
1	in the gaol of cluanmeala 
1	no boy in the village
1	was ever yet milder 
1	i d play with a child 
1	and my sport would be wilder 
1	i d dance without tiring
1	from morning till even 
1	and the goal ball i d strike
1	to the lightning of heaven 
1	at my bed foot decaying 
1	my hurlbat is lying 
1	through the boys of the village
1	my goal ball is flying 
1	my horse mong the neighbours
1	neglected may fallow 
1	while i pine in my chains 
1	in the gaol of cluanmeala 
1	next sunday the patron
1	at home will be keeping 
1	and the young active hurlers
1	the field will be sweeping 
1	with the dance of fair maidens
1	the evening they ll hallow 
1	while this heart once so gay 
1	shall be cold in cluanmeala 
1	o many a day have i made good ale in the glen 
1	that came not of stream or malt like the brewing of men 
1	my bed was the ground my roof the greenwood above 
1	and the wealth that i sought one far kind glance from my love 
1	alas on that night when the horses i drove from the field 
1	that i was not near from terror my angel to shield 
1	she stretched forth her arms her mantle she flung to the wind 
1	and swam o er loch lene her outlawed lover to find 
1	o would that a freezing sleet wing d tempest did sweep 
1	and i and my love were alone far off on the deep 
1	i d ask not a ship or a bark or pinnace to save 
1	with her hand round my waist i d fear not the wind or the wave 
1	 tis down by the lake where the wild tree fringes its sides 
1	the maid of my heart my fair one of heaven resides 
1	i think as at eve she wanders its mazes along 
1	the birds go to sleep by the sweet wild twist of her song 
1	no longer shines brightly 
1	the voice of her music
1	no longer is sprightly 
1	no more to her maidens
1	the light dance is dear 
1	since the death of our darling
1	scully thou false one 
1	you basely betrayed him 
1	in his strong hour of need 
1	when thy right hand should aid him 
1	he fed thee he clad thee 
1	you had all could delight thee 
1	you left him you sold him 
1	may heaven requite thee 
1	scully may all kinds
1	of evil attend thee 
1	on thy dark road of life
1	may no kind one befriend thee 
1	may fevers long burn thee 
1	and agues long freeze thee 
1	may the strong hand of god
1	in his red anger seize thee 
1	had he died calmly 
1	i would not deplore him 
1	or if the wild strife
1	of the sea war closed o er him 
1	but with ropes round his white limbs
1	through ocean to trail him 
1	like a fish after slaughter 
1	 tis therefore i wail him 
1	long may the curse
1	of his people pursue them 
1	scully that sold him 
1	and soldier that slew him 
1	one glimpse of heaven s light
1	may they see never 
1	may the hearthstone of hell
1	be their best bed for ever 
1	in the hole which the vile hands
1	of soldiers had made thee 
1	unhonour d unshrouded 
1	and headless they laid thee 
1	no sigh to regret thee 
1	no eye to rain o er thee 
1	no dirge to lament thee 
1	no friend to deplore thee 
1	dear head of my darling 
1	how gory and pale 
1	these aged eyes see thee 
1	high spiked on their gaol 
1	that cheek in the summer sun
1	ne er shall grow warm 
1	nor that eye e er catch light 
1	but the flash of the storm 
1	a curse blessed ocean 
1	is on thy green water 
1	from the haven of cork
1	to ivera of slaughter 
1	since thy billows were dyed
1	with the red wounds of fear
1	sweet in her green dell the flower of beauty slumbers 
1	lulled by the faint breezes sighing through her hair 
1	sleeps she and hears not the melancholy numbers
1	breathed to my sad lute mid the lonely air 
1	down from the high cliffs the rivulet is teeming
1	to wind round the willow banks that lure him from above 
1	o that in tears from my rocky prison streaming 
1	i too could glide to the bower of my love 
1	ah where the woodbines with sleepy arms have wound her 
1	opes she her eyelids at the dream of my lay 
1	listening like the dove while the fountains echo round her 
1	to her lost mate s call in the forests far away 
1	come then my bird for the peace thou ever bearest 
1	still heaven s messenger of comfort to me 
1	come this fond bosom o faithfulest and fairest
1	bleeds with its death wound its wound of love for thee 
1	when pat came over the hill 
1	his colleen fair to see 
1	his whistle low but shrill 
1	the signal was to be 
1	 mary the mother said 
1	 some one is whistling sure 
1	says mary tis only the wind
1	is whistling through the door 
1	 pat whistles a bit of a popular air 
1	 i ve lived a long time mary 
1	in this wide world my dear 
1	but a door to whistle like that 
1	i never yet did hear 
1	 but mother you know the fiddle
1	and the wind upon the strings
1	is playing the tune i think 
1	 mary i hear the pig 
1	unaisy in his mind 
1	 but mother you know they say
1	the pigs can see the wind 
1	 that s true enough in the day 
1	but i think you may remark 
1	that pigs no more nor we
1	can see anything in the dark 
1	 the dog is barking now 
1	the fiddle can t play the tune 
1	 but mother the dogs will bark
1	whenever they see the moon 
1	 but how could he see the moon 
1	when you know the dog is blind 
1	blind dogs won t bark at the moon 
1	nor fiddles be played by the wind 
1	 i m not such a fool as you think 
1	i know very well it is pat 
1	shut your mouth you whistlin thief 
1	and go along home out o that 
1	 and you be off to your bed 
1	don t play upon me your jeers 
1	for though i have lost my eyes 
1	i haven t lost my ears 
1	am i the slave they say 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	since you did show the way 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	 their slave no more to be 
1	while they would work with me
1	old ireland s slavery 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	why not her poorest man 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	try and do all he can 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	her commands to fulfil
1	of his own heart and will 
1	side by side with you still

1	who in the winter s night 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	when the cold blast did bite 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	came to my cabin door 
1	and on my earthen floor 
1	knelt by me sick and poor 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	who on the marriage day 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	made the poor cabin gay 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	and did both laugh and sing 
1	making our hearts to ring 
1	at the poor christening 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	who as friend only met 
1	soggarth aroon 
1	never did flout me yet

1	to heal your many ills 
1	and one beamy smile from you
1	would float like light between

1	ere you shall fade ere you shall die 
1	the judgment hour must first be nigh
1	ere you can fade ere you can die 
1	o woman of the piercing wail 
1	who mournest o er yon mound of clay
1	with sigh and groan 
1	would god thou wert among the gael 
1	thou wouldst not then from day to day
1	weep thus alone 
1	 twere long before around a grave
1	in green tyrconnell one could find
1	this loneliness 
1	near where beann boirche s banners wave
1	such grief as thine could ne er have pined
1	beside the wave in donegal 
1	in antrim s glens or fair dromore 
1	or where the sunny waters fall
1	at assaroe near erna s shore 
1	this could not be 
1	on derry s plains in rich drumclieff 
1	throughout armagh the great renowned
1	in olden years 
1	no day could pass but woman s grief
1	would rain upon the burial ground
1	fresh floods of tears 
1	o no from shannon boyne and suir 
1	from high dunluce s castle walls 
1	would flock alike both rich and poor 
1	one wail would rise from cruachan s halls
1	to tara s hill 
1	and some would come from barrow side 
1	and many a maid would leave her home 
1	on leitrim s plains 
1	and by melodious banna s tide 
1	and by the mourne and erne to come
1	and swell thy strains 
1	o horses hoofs would trample down
1	the mount whereon the martyr saint
1	was crucified 
1	from glen and hill from plain and town 
1	one loud lament one thrilling plaint 
1	would echo wide 
1	there would not soon be found i ween 
1	one foot of ground among those bands
1	for museful thought 
1	so many shriekers of the keen 
1	would cry aloud and clap their hands 
1	all woe distraught 
1	two princes of the line of conn
1	sleep in their cells of clay beside
1	three royal youths alas are gone 
1	who lived for erin s weal but died
1	for erin s woe 
1	ah could the men of ireland read
1	the names these noteless burial stones
1	display to view 
1	their wounded hearts afresh would bleed 
1	their tears gush forth again their groans
1	resound anew 
1	the youths whose relics moulder here
1	were sprung from hugh high prince and lord
1	of aileach s lands 
1	thy noble brothers justly dear 
1	thy nephew long to be deplored
1	by ulster s bands 
1	theirs were not souls wherein dull time
1	could domicile decay or house
1	they passed from earth ere manhood s prime 
1	ere years had power to dim their brows
1	or chill their blood 
1	and who can marvel o er thy grief 
1	or who can blame thy flowing tears 
1	that knows their source 
1	o donnell dunnasava s chief 
1	cut off amid his vernal years 
1	lies here a corse
1	beside his brother cathbar whom
1	tirconnell of the helmets mourns
1	in deep despair 
1	for valour truth and comely bloom 
1	for all that greatens and adorns
1	a peerless pair 
1	o had these twain and he the third 
1	the lord of mourne o niall s son 
1	their mate in death 
1	a prince in look in deed and word 
1	had these three heroes yielded on
1	the field their breath 
1	o had they fallen on criffan s plain 
1	there would not be a town or clan
1	from shore to sea 
1	but would with shrieks bewail the slain 
1	or chant aloud the exulting rann 
1	when high the shout of battle rose 
1	on fields where freedom s torch still burned
1	through erin s gloom 
1	if one if barely one of those
1	were slain all ulster would have mourned
1	the hero s doom 
1	if at athboy where hosts of brave
1	ulidian horsemen sank beneath
1	the shock of spears 
1	young hugh o neill had found a grave 
1	long must the north have wept his death
1	with heart wrung tears 
1	if on the day of ballach myre
1	the lord of mourne had met thus young 
1	a warrior s fate 
1	in vain would such as thou desire
1	to mourn alone the champion sprung
1	no marvel this for all the dead 
1	heaped on the field pile over pile 
1	at mullach brack 
1	were scarce an eric for his head 
1	if death had stayed his footsteps while
1	on victory s track 
1	the fruit had from the parent bough
1	been rudely torn
1	in sight of munster s bands mac nee s 
1	such blow the blood of conn i trow 
1	could ill have borne 
1	if on the day of ballach boy
1	some arm had laid by foul surprise 
1	the chieftain low 
1	even our victorious shout of joy
1	would soon give place to rueful cries
1	and groans of woe 
1	if on the day the saxon host
1	were forced to fly a day so great
1	the chief had been untimely lost 
1	our conquering troops should moderate
1	their mirthful glee 
1	there would not lack on lifford s day 
1	from galway from the glens of boyle 
1	from limerick s towers 
1	a marshalled file a long array
1	of mourners to bedew the soil
1	with tears in showers 
1	if on the day a sterner fate
1	compelled his flight from athenree 
1	his blood had flowed 
1	what numbers all disconsolate 
1	would come unasked and share with thee
1	affliction s load 
1	if derry s crimson field had seen
1	his life blood offered up though twere
1	on victory s shrine 
1	a thousand cries would swell the keen 
1	a thousand voices of despair
1	would echo thine 
1	o had the fierce dalcassian swarm
1	that bloody night on fergus banks
1	but slain our chief 
1	when rose his camp in wild alarm 
1	how would the triumph of his ranks
1	be dashed with grief 
1	how would the troops of murbach mourn
1	if on the curlew mountains day 
1	which england rued 
1	some saxon hand had left them lorn 
1	by shedding there amid the fray 
1	their prince s blood 
1	red would have been our warriors eyes
1	had roderick found on sligo field
1	a gory grave 
1	no northern chief would soon arise 
1	so sage to guide so strong to shield 
1	so swift to save 
1	long would leith cuinn have wept if hugh
1	had met the death he oft had dealt
1	among the foe 
1	but had our roderick fallen too 
1	all erin must alas have felt
1	the deadly blow 
1	what do i say ah woe is me 
1	already we bewail in vain
1	their fatal fall 
1	and erin once the great and free 
1	now vainly mourns her breakless chain 
1	and iron thrall 
1	then daughter of o donnell dry
1	thine overflowing eyes and turn
1	thy heart aside 
1	for adam s race is born to die 
1	and sternly the sepulchral urn
1	mocks human pride 
1	look not nor sigh for earthly throne 
1	nor place thy trust in arm of clay 
1	but on thy knees
1	uplift thy soul to god alone 
1	for all things go their destined way
1	as he decrees 
1	embrace the faithful crucifix 
1	and seek the path of pain and prayer
1	thy saviour trod 
1	nor let thy spirit intermix
1	with earthly hope and worldly care
1	its groans to god 
1	and thou o mighty lord whose ways
1	are far above our feeble minds
1	to understand 
1	sustain us in these doleful days 
1	and render light the chain that binds
1	our fallen land 
1	look down upon our dreary state 
1	and through the ages that may still
1	roll sadly on 
1	watch thou o er hapless erin s fate 
1	and shield at least from darker ill
1	the blood of conn 
1	there was lifted up one voice of woe 
1	one lament of more than mortal grief 
1	through the wide south to and fro 
1	for a fallen chief 
1	in the dead of night that cry thrilled through me 
1	i looked out upon the midnight air 
1	mine own soul was all as gloomy 
1	and i knelt in prayer 
1	o er loch gur that night once twice yea thrice 
1	passed a wail of anguish for the brave 
1	that half curled into ice
1	the moon mirroring wave 
1	then uprose a many toned wild hymn in
1	choral swell from ogra s dark ravine 
1	and moguly s phantom women
1	far on carah mona s emerald plains 
1	shrieks and sighs were blended many hours 
1	and fermoy in fitful strains 
1	answered from her towers 
1	mourned in concert and their piercing keen 
1	woke to wondering life the stilly
1	from loughmoe to yellow dunanore
1	there was fear the traders of tralee
1	gathered up their golden store 
1	and prepared to flee 
1	for in ship and hall from night till morning
1	showed the first faint beamings of the sun 
1	all the foreigners heard the warning
1	 this they spake portendeth death to us 
1	if we fly not swiftly from our fate 
1	ravingly to prate 
1	not for base born higgling saxon trucksters
1	ring laments like those by shore and sea 
1	not for churls with souls of hucksters
1	for the high milesian race alone
1	ever flows the music of her woe 
1	for slain heir to bygone throne 
1	and for chief laid low 
1	hark again methinks i hear her weeping
1	yonder is she near me now as then 
1	or was but the night wind sweeping
1	down the hollow glen 
1	o woman of three cows agragh don t let your
1	tongue thus rattle 
1	o don t be saucy don t be stiff because you may
1	have cattle 
1	i have seen and here s my hand to you i only say
1	what s true 
1	a many a one with twice your stock not half so proud
1	as you 
1	good luck to you don t scorn the poor and don t be
1	their despiser 
1	for worldly wealth soon melts away and cheats the
1	very miser 
1	and death soon strips the proudest wreath from
1	haughty human brows 
1	then don t be stiff and don t be proud good woman
1	see where momonia s heroes lie proud owen more s
1	descendants 
1	 tis they that won the glorious name and had the
1	grand attendants 
1	if they were forced to bow to fate as every mortal
1	bows 
1	can you be proud can you be stiff my woman
1	the brave sons of the lord of clare they left the
1	land to mourning 
1	 mavrone for they were banished with no hope of
1	their returning 
1	who knows in what abodes of want those youths were
1	driven to house 
1	yet you can give yourself these airs o woman
1	o think of donnel of the ships the chief whom
1	nothing daunted 
1	see how he fell in distant spain unchronicled 
1	unchanted 
1	he sleeps the great o sullivan where thunder
1	cannot rouse 
1	then ask yourself should you be proud good woman
1	o ruark maguire those souls of fire whose names
1	are shrined in story 
1	think how their high achievements once made erin s
1	greatest glory 
1	yet now their bones lie mouldering under weeds and
1	cyprus boughs 
1	and so for all your pride will yours o woman
1	th o carrols also famed when fame was only for
1	the boldest 
1	rest in forgotten sepulchres with erin s best and
1	oldest 
1	yet who so great as they of yore in battle or
1	carouse 
1	just think of that and hide your head good woman
1	your neighbour s poor and you it seems are big
1	with vain ideas 
1	because inagh you ve got three cows one more i see 
1	than she has 
1	that tongue of yours wags more at times than
1	charity allows 
1	but if you re strong be merciful great woman
1	now there you go you still of course keep up
1	your scornful bearing 
1	and i m too poor to hinder you but by the cloak
1	i m wearing 
1	if i had but four cows myself even though you were
1	my spouse 
1	i d thwack you well to cure your pride my woman
1	i found in innisfail the fair 
1	in ireland while in exile there 
1	women of worth both grave and gay men 
1	many clerics and many laymen 
1	i travelled its fruitful provinces round
1	and in every one of the five i found 
1	alike in church and in palace hall 
1	abundant apparel and food for all 
1	gold and silver i found and money 
1	plenty of wheat and plenty of honey 
1	i found god s people rich in pity 
1	found many a feast and many a city 
1	i also found in armagh the splendid 
1	meekness wisdom and prudence blended 
1	fasting as christ hath recommended 
1	and noble councillors untranscended 
1	i found in each great church moreo er 
1	whether on island or on shore
1	piety learning fond affection 
1	holy welcome and kind protection 
1	i found thy good lay monks and brothers
1	ever beseeching help for others 
1	and in their keeping the holy word
1	pure as it came from jesus the lord 
1	i found in munster unfettered of any 
1	kings and queens and poets a many 
1	poets were skilled in music and measure 
1	prosperous doings mirth and pleasure 
1	i found in connaught the just redundance
1	of riches milk in lavish abundance 
1	hospitality vigour fame 
1	in cruachan s land of heroic name 
1	i found in the county of connall the glorious
1	bravest heroes ever victorious 
1	fair complexioned men and warlike 
1	ireland s lights the high the starlike 
1	i found in ulster from hill to glen 
1	hardy warriors resolute men 
1	beauty that bloomed when youth was gone 
1	and strength transmitted from sire to son 
1	i found in the noble district of boyle
1	brehons erenachs weapons bright 
1	and horsemen bold and sudden in fight 
1	i found in leinster the smooth and sleek 
1	from dublin to slewmargy s peak 
1	flourishing pastures valour health 
1	long living worthies commerce wealth 
1	i found besides from ara to glea 
1	in the broad rich country of ossorie 
1	sweet fruits good laws for all and each 
1	great chess players men of truthful speech 
1	i found in meath s fair principality 
1	virtue vigour and hospitality 
1	candour joyfulness bravery purity 
1	ireland s bulwark and security 
1	i found strict morals in age and youth 
1	i found historians recording truth 
1	the things i sing of in verse unsmooth 
1	i found them all i have written sooth 
1	where is my chief my master this bleak night mavrone 
1	o cold cold miserably cold is this bleak night for hugh 
1	rolls real thunder or was that red livid light
1	only a meteor i scarce know but through the midnight dim
1	an awful a tremendous night is this meseems 
1	the flood gates of the river of heaven i think have been
1	burst wide 
1	though he were even a wolf ranging the round green woods 
1	though he were even a pleasant salmon in the unchainable sea 
1	though he were a wild mountain eagle he could scarce bear he 
1	this sharp sore sleet these howling floods 
1	o mournful is my soul this night for hugh maguire 
1	darkly as in a dream he strays before him and behind
1	triumphs the tyrannous anger of the wounding wind 
1	the wounding wind that burns as fire 
1	it is my bitter grief it cuts me to the heart 
1	that in the country of clan darry this should be his fate 
1	o woe is me where is he wandering houseless desolate 
1	alone without or guide or chart 
1	medreams i see just now his face the strawberry bright 
1	uplifted to the blackened heavens while the tempestuous winds
1	blow fiercely over and round him and the smiting
1	sleet shower blinds
1	the hero of galang to night 
1	large large affliction unto me and mine it is 
1	that one of his majestic bearing his fair stately form 
1	should thus be tortured and o erborne that this unsparing storm
1	should wreak its wrath on head like his 
1	that his great hand so oft the avenger of the oppressed 
1	he walks and wanders without rest 
1	the tempest driven torrent deluges the mead 
1	it overflows the low banks of the rivulets and ponds 
1	the lawns and pasture grounds lie locked in icy bonds
1	so that the cattle cannot feed 
1	the pale bright margins of the streams are seen by none 
1	rushes and sweeps along the untamable flood on every side 
1	it penetrates and fills the cottagers dwellings far and wide 
1	water and land are blent in one 
1	through some dark wood mid bones of monsters hugh now strays 
1	as he confronts the storm with anguished heart but manly brow 
1	o what a sword wound to that tender heart of his were now
1	a backward glance of peaceful days 
1	but other thoughts are his thoughts that can still inspire
1	with joy and onward bounding hope the bosom of mac nee 
1	thoughts of his warriors charging like bright billows the sea 
1	borne on the wind s wings flashing fire 
1	and though frost glaze to night the clear dew of his eyes 
1	and white ice gauntlets glove his noble fine fair fingers o er 
1	a warm dress is to him that lightning garb he ever wore 
1	the lightning of the soul not skies 
1	hugh marched forth to the fight i grieved to see him so depart 
1	roll forth my song like the rushing river 
1	that sweeps along to the mighty sea 
1	god will inspire me while i deliver
1	my soul to thee 
1	tell thou the world when my bones lie whitening
1	amid the last homes of youth and eld 
1	that there was once one whose blood ran lightning
1	no eye beheld 
1	tell how his boyhood was one drear night hour 
1	how shone for him through its griefs and gloom 
1	no star of all heaven sends to light our
1	path to the tomb 
1	roll on my song and to after ages
1	tell how disdaining all earth can give 
1	he would have taught men from wisdom s pages 
1	the way to live 
1	and tell how trampled derided hated 
1	and worn by weakness disease and wrong 
1	he fled for shelter to god who mated
1	his soul with song 
1	with song which alway sublime or vapid 
1	flowed like a rill in the morning beam 
1	perchance not deep but intense and rapid 
1	a mountain stream 
1	tell how this nameless condemned for years long
1	to herd with demons from hell beneath 
1	saw things that made him with groans and tears long
1	for even death 
1	go on to tell how with genius wasted 
1	betrayed in friendship befooled in love 
1	with spirit shipwrecked and young hopes blasted 
1	he still still strove 
1	till spent with toil dreeing death for others 
1	and some whose hands should have wrought for him 
1	 if children live not for sires and mothers 
1	his mind grew dim 
1	and he fell far through that pit abysmal
1	the gulf and grave of maginn and burns 
1	and pawned his soul for the devil s dismal
1	stock of returns 
1	but yet redeemed it in days of darkness 
1	and shapes and signs of the final wrath 
1	when death in hideous and ghastly starkness 
1	stood on his path 
1	and tell how now amid wreck and sorrow 
1	and want and sickness and houseless nights 
1	he bides in calmness the silent morrow 
1	that no ray lights 
1	and lives he still then yes old and hoary
1	at thirty nine from despair and woe 
1	he lives enduring what future story
1	will never know 
1	him grant a grave to ye pitying noble 
1	deep in your bosoms there let him dwell 
1	he too had tears for all souls in trouble 
1	here and in hell 
1	in siberia s wastes
1	the ice wind s breath
1	woundeth like the toothed steel 
1	lost siberia doth reveal
1	only blight and death 
1	blight and death alone 
1	no summer shines 
1	night is interblent with day 
1	in siberia s wastes alway
1	the blood blackens the heart pines 
1	in siberia s wastes
1	no tears are shed 
1	for they freeze within the brain 
1	nought is felt but dullest pain 
1	pain acute yet dead 
1	pain as in a dream 
1	when years go by
1	funeral paced yet fugitive 
1	when man lives and doth not live 
1	doth not live nor die 
1	in siberia s wastes
1	are sands and rocks 
1	nothing blooms of green or soft 
1	but the snowpeaks rise aloft
1	and the gaunt ice blocks 
1	and the exile there
1	is one with those 
1	they are part and he is part 
1	for the sands are in his heart 
1	and the killing snows 
1	therefore in those wastes
1	none curse the czar 
1	each man s tongue is cloven by
1	the north blast who heweth nigh
1	with sharp scymitar 
1	and such doom he drees 
1	till hunger gnawn 
1	and cold slain he at length sinks there 
1	yet scarce more a corpse than ere
1	his last breath was drawn 
1	on the ocean that hollows the rocks where ye dwell 
1	a shadowy land has appeared as they tell 
1	men thought it a region of sunshine and rest 
1	and they called it hy brasail the isle of the blest 
1	from year unto year on the ocean s blue rim 
1	the beautiful spectre showed lovely and dim 
1	the golden clouds curtained the deep where it lay 
1	and it looked like an eden away far away 
1	a peasant who heard of the wonderful tale 
1	in the breeze of the orient loosened his sail 
1	from ara the holy he turned to the west 
1	for though ara was holy hy brasail was blest 
1	he heard not the voices that called from the shore 
1	he heard not the rising wind s menacing roar 
1	home kindred and safety he left on that day 
1	and he sped to hy brasail away far away 
1	morn rose on the deep and that shadowy isle 
1	o er the faint rim of distance reflected its smile 
1	noon burned on the wave and that shadowy shore
1	seemed lovelily distant and faint as before 
1	lone evening came down on the wanderer s track 
1	and to ara again he looked timidly back 
1	o far on the verge of the ocean it lay 
1	yet the isle of the blest was away far away 
1	rash dreamer return o ye winds of the main 
1	bear him back to his own peaceful ara again 
1	bash fool for a vision of fanciful bliss
1	to barter thy calm life of labour and peace 
1	the warning of reason was spoken in vain 
1	he never re visited ara again 
1	night falls on the deep amidst tempest and spray 
1	and he died on the waters away far away 
1	my heart is far from liffey s tide
1	and dublin town 
1	it strays beyond the southern side
1	where capa chuinn hath woodlands green 
1	where amhan mhor s waters flow 
1	where dwell unsung unsought unseen
1	 mo craoibhin cno 
1	low clustering in her leafy screen 
1	 mo craoibhin cno 
1	the high bred dames of dublin town
1	are rich and fair 
1	with wavy plume and silken gown 
1	and stately air 
1	can plumes compare thy dark brown hair 
1	can silks thy neck of snow 
1	or measur d pace thine artless grace 
1	 mo craoibhin cno 
1	when harebells scarcely show thy trace 
1	 mo craoibhin cno 
1	i ve heard the songs by liffey s wave
1	that maidens sung 
1	they sung their land the saxon s slave 
1	in saxon tongue 
1	o bring me here that gaelic dear
1	which cursed the saxon foe 
1	when thou didst charm my raptured ear 
1	 mo craoibhin cno 
1	and none but god s good angels near 
1	 mo craoibhin cno 
1	i ve wandered by the rolling lee 
1	and lene s green bowers 
1	i ve seen the shannon s wide spread sea
1	and limerick s towers 
1	and liffey s tide where halls of pride
1	frown o er the flood below 
1	my wild heart strays to amhan mhor s side 
1	 mo craoibhin cno 
1	with love and thee for aye to bide 
1	 mo craoibhin cno 
1	at the dance in the village thy white foot was fleetest 
1	thy voice in the concert of maidens was sweetest 
1	the swell of thy white breast made rich lovers follow 
1	and thy raven hair bound them young mairgread ni chealleadh 
1	thy neck was lost maid than the ceanabhan whiter 
1	and the glow of thy cheek than the monadan brighter 
1	but death s chain hath bound thee thine eye s glazed and hollow 
1	no more shall mine ear drink thy melody swelling 
1	nor thy beamy eye brighten the outlaw s dark dwelling 
1	or thy soft heaving bosom my destiny hallow 
1	when thine arms twine around me young mairgread ni chealleadh 
1	the moss couch i brought thee to day from the mountain 
1	has drank the last drop of thy young heart s red fountain 
1	for this good scian beside me stuck deep and run hollow
1	in thy bosom of treason young mairgread ni chealleadh 
1	with strings of rich pearls thy white neck was laden 
1	and thy fingers with spoils of the sassanach maiden 
1	such rich silks enrob d not the proud dames of mallow 
1	such pure gold they wore not as mairgread ni chealleadh 
1	alas that my loved one her outlaw would injure 
1	alas that he e er proved her treason s avenger 
1	that this right hand should make thee a bed cold and hollow 
1	and while to this lone cave my deep grief i m venting 
1	the saxon s keen bandog my footstep is scenting 
1	but true men await me afar in duhallow 
1	farewell cave of slaughter and mairgread ni chealleadh 
1	from the cold sod that s o er you

1	were my hands twined in yours love

1	my fondest my fairest 
1	we may now sleep together 
1	i ve the cold earth s damp odour 
1	and i m worn from the weather 
1	this heart filled with fondness
1	is wounded and weary 
1	a dark gulf beneath it
1	yawns jet black and dreary 
1	when death comes a victor 
1	in mercy to greet me 
1	on the wings of the whirlwind
1	in the wild wastes you ll meet me 
1	when the folk of my household
1	suppose i am sleeping 
1	on your cold grave till morning

1	are ceaselessly chiding 
1	that i love a young maiden
1	in life not abiding 
1	o i d shelter and shield you
1	if wild storms were swelling 
1	and o my wrecked hope 
1	that the cold earth s your dwelling 
1	sweet babe a golden cradle holds thee 
1	and soft the snow white fleece enfolds thee 
1	in airy bower i ll watch thy sleeping

1	i m sittin on the stile mary 
1	where we sat side by side 
1	on a bright may mornin long ago 
1	when first you were my bride 
1	the corn was springin fresh and green 
1	and the lark sang loud and high 
1	and the red was on your lip mary 
1	and the love light in your eye 
1	the place is little changed mary 
1	the day is bright as then 
1	the lark s loud song is in my ear 
1	and the corn is green again 
1	but i miss the soft clasp of your hand 
1	and your breath warm on my cheek 
1	and i still keep list nin for the words
1	you never more will speak 
1	 tis but a step down yonder lane 
1	and the little church stands near 
1	the church where we were wed mary 
1	i see the spire from here 
1	but the graveyard lies between mary 
1	and my step might break your rest 
1	for i ve laid you darling down to sleep 
1	with your baby on your breast 
1	i m very lonely now mary 
1	for the poor make no new friends 
1	but o they love the better still 
1	the few our father sends 
1	and you were all i had mary 
1	my blessin and my pride 
1	there s nothin left to care for now 
1	since my poor mary died 
1	yours was the good brave heart mary 
1	that still kept hoping on 
1	when the trust in god had left my soul 
1	and my arm s young strength was gone 
1	there was comfort even on your lip 
1	and the kind look on your brow 
1	i bless you mary for that same 
1	though you cannot hear me now 
1	i thank you for the patient smile
1	when your heart was fit to break 
1	when the hunger pain was gnawin there 
1	and you hid it for my sake 
1	i bless you for the pleasant word 
1	when your heart was sad and sore 
1	o i m thankful you are gone mary 
1	where grief can t reach you more 
1	i m biddin you a long farewell 
1	my mary kind and true 
1	but i ll not forget you darling 
1	in the land i m goin to 
1	they say there s bread and work for all 
1	and the sun shines always there 
1	but i ll not forget old ireland 
1	were it fifty times as fair 
1	and often in those grand old woods
1	i ll sit and shut my eyes 
1	and my heart will travel back again
1	to the place where mary lies 
1	and i ll think i see the little stile
1	where we sat side by side 
1	and the springin corn and the bright may morn 
1	when first you were my bride 
1	scorney bwee the barretts bailiff lewd and lame 
1	to lift the lynott s taxes when he came 
1	rudely drew a young maid to him 
1	then the lynotts rose and slew him 
1	and in tubber na scorney threw him 
1	small your blame 
1	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	then the barretts to the lynotts gave a choice 
1	saying hear ye murderous brood men and boys 
1	choose ye now without delay 
1	will ye lose your eyesight say 
1	or your manhoods here to day 
1	sad your choice 
1	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	then the little boys of the lynotts weeping said 
1	 only leave us our eyesight in our head 
1	but the bearded lynotts then
1	quickly answered back again 
1	 take our eyes but leave us men 
1	alive or dead 
1	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	so the barretts with sewing needles sharp and smooth 
1	let the light out of the eyes of every youth 
1	and of every bearded man 
1	of the broken lynott clan 
1	then their darkened faces wan
1	turning south
1	to the river 
1	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	o er the slippery stepping stones of clochan na n all
1	they drove them laughing loud at every fall 
1	as their wandering footsteps dark
1	failed to reach the slippery mark 
1	and the swift stream swallowed stark 
1	one and all
1	as they stumbled 
1	from the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	of all the blinded lynotts one alone
1	walk d erect from stepping stone to stone 
1	so back again they brought you 
1	and a second time they wrought you
1	with their needles but never got you
1	once to groan 
1	for the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	but with prompt projected footsteps sure as ever 
1	emon lynott again cross d the river 
1	though duvowen was rising fast 
1	and the shaking stones o ercast
1	by cold floods boiling past 
1	yet you never 
1	faltered once before your foemen of tirawley 
1	but turning on ballintubber bank you stood 
1	and the barretts thus bespoke o er the flood 
1	 o ye foolish sons of wattin 
1	small amends are these you ve gotten 
1	for while scorna boy lies rotten 
1	i am good
1	for vengeance 
1	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	 for tis neither in eye nor eyesight that a man
1	bears the fortunes of himself and his clan 
1	but in the manly mind 
1	these darken d orbs behind 
1	that your needles could never find
1	though they ran
1	through my heart strings 
1	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	 but little your women s needles do i reck 
1	for the night from heaven never fell so black 
1	but tirawley and abroad
1	from the moy to cuan an fod 
1	i could walk it every sod 
1	path and track 
1	ford and togher 
1	seeking vengeance on you barretts of tirawley 
1	 the night when dathy o dowda broke your camp 
1	what barrett among you was it held the lamp 
1	showed the way to those two feet 
1	when through wintry wind and sleet 
1	i guided your blind retreat
1	in the swamp
1	of beael an asa 
1	o ye vengeance destined ingrates of tirawley 
1	so leaving loud shriek echoing garranard 
1	the lynott like a red dog hunted hard 
1	with his wife and children seven 
1	 mong the beasts and fowls of heaven
1	in the hollows of glen nephin 
1	light debarred 
1	made his dwelling 
1	planning vengeance on the barretts of tirawley 
1	and ere the bright orb d year its course had run 
1	on his brown round knotted knee he nursed a son 
1	a child of light with eyes
1	as clear as are the skies
1	in summer when sunrise
1	has begun 
1	nursed his vengeance on the barretts of tirawley 
1	and as ever the bright boy grew in strength and size 
1	made him perfect in each manly exercise 
1	the salmon in the flood 
1	the dun deer in the wood 
1	the eagle in the cloud
1	to surprise
1	far above the foggy fields of tirawley 
1	with the yellow knotted spear shaft with the bow 
1	with the steel prompt to deal shot and blow 
1	he taught him from year to year
1	and train d him without a peer 
1	for a perfect cavalier 
1	hoping so 
1	far his forethought 
1	for vengeance on the barretts of tirawley 
1	and when mounted on his proud bounding steed 
1	emon oge sat a cavalier indeed 
1	like the ear upon the wheat
1	when winds in autumn beat
1	on the bending stems his seat 
1	and the speed
1	of his courser
1	was the wind from barna na gee o er tirawley 
1	now when fifteen sunny summers thus were spent 
1	 he perfected in all accomplishment 
1	the lynott said my child 
1	we are over long exiled
1	from mankind in this wild 
1	 time we went
1	through the mountain
1	to the countries lying over against tirawley 
1	so out over mountain moors and mosses brown 
1	and green steam gathering vales they journey d down 
1	till shining like a star 
1	through the dusky gleams afar 
1	the bailey of castlebar 
1	and the town
1	of macwilliam
1	rose bright before the wanderers of tirawley 
1	 look southward my boy and tell me as we go 
1	what see st thou by the loch head below 
1	 o a stone house strong and great 
1	and a horse host at the gate 
1	and a captain in armour of plate 
1	grand the show 
1	great the glancing 
1	high the heroes of this land below tirawley 
1	 and a beautiful bantierna by his side 
1	yellow gold on all her gown sleeves wide 
1	and in her hand a pearl
1	of a young little fair haired girl 
1	let us ride
1	to his presence 
1	and before him came the exiles of tirawley 
1	 god save thee macwilliam the lynott thus began 
1	 god save all here besides of this clan 
1	for gossips dear to me
1	are all in company 
1	for in these four bones ye see
1	a kindly man
1	 and hither as kindly gossip law allows 
1	i come to claim a scion of thy house
1	to foster for thy race 
1	since william conquer s days 
1	have ever been wont to place 
1	with some spouse
1	a macwilliam oge to foster in tirawley 
1	 and to show thee in what sort our youth are taught
1	i have hither to thy home of valour brought
1	this one son of my age 
1	for a sample and a pledge
1	for the equal tutelage 
1	in right thought 
1	word and action 
1	of whatever son ye give into tirawley 
1	when macwilliam beheld the brave boy ride and run 
1	saw the spear shaft from his white shoulder spun 
1	with a sigh and with a smile 
1	he said i would give the spoil
1	of a county that tibbot moyle 
1	my own son 
1	were accomplish d
1	like this branch of the kindly britons of tirawley 
1	when the lady macwilliam she heard him speak 
1	and saw the ruddy roses on his cheek 
1	she said i would give a purse
1	of red gold to the nurse
1	that would rear my tibbot no worse 
1	but i seek
1	hitherto vainly 
1	heaven grant that i now have found her in tirawley 
1	so they said to the lynott here take our bird 
1	and as pledge for the keeping of thy word 
1	let this scion here remain
1	till thou comest back again 
1	meanwhile the fitting train
1	of a lord
1	shall attend thee
1	with the lordly heir of connaught into tirawley 
1	so back to strong throng gathering garranard 
1	like a lord of the country with his guard 
1	came the lynott before them all 
1	once again over clochan na n all
1	steady and striding erect and tall 
1	and his ward
1	on his shoulders
1	to the wonder of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	then a diligent foster father you would deem
1	the lynott teaching tibbot by mead and stream 
1	to cast the spear to ride 
1	to stem the rushing tide 
1	with what feats of body beside 
1	might beseem
1	a macwilliam 
1	fostered free among the welshmen of tirawley 
1	but the lesson of hell he taught him in heart and mind 
1	for to what desire soever he inclined 
1	of anger lust or pride 
1	he had it gratified 
1	till he ranged the circle wide
1	of a blind
1	self indulgence 
1	ere he came to youthful manhood in tirawley 
1	then even as when a hunter slips a hound 
1	lynott loosed him god s leashes all unbound 
1	in the pride of power and station 
1	and the strength of youthful passion 
1	on the daughters of thy nation 
1	all around 
1	o the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	bitter grief and burning anger rage and shame 
1	filled the houses of the barretts where er he came 
1	till the young men of the back 
1	drew by night upon his track 
1	and slew him at cornassack 
1	small your blame 
1	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
1	said the lynott the day of my vengeance is drawing near 
1	the day for which through many a long dark year 
1	i have toiled through grief and sin 
1	and let the plea begin
1	over the bier
1	of macwilliam 
1	for an eric upon the barretts of tirawley 
1	then the brehons to macwilliam burke decreed
1	an eric upon clan barrett for the deed 
1	and the lynott s share of the fine 
1	as foster father was nine
1	ploughlands and nine score kine 
1	but no need
1	neither care for land or cattle in tirawley 
1	but rising while all sat silent on the spot 
1	he said the law says doth it not 
1	if the foster sire elect
1	his portion to reject 
1	he may then the right exact
1	to applot
1	the short eric 
1	 tis the law replied the brehons of tirawley 
1	said the lynott i once before had a choice
1	proposed me wherein law had little voice 
1	but now i choose and say 
1	as lawfully i may 
1	i applot the mulct to day 
1	so rejoice
1	in your ploughlands
1	and your cattle which i renounce throughout tirawley 
1	 and thus i applot the mulct i divide
1	the land throughout clan barrett on every side
1	equally that no place
1	may be without the face
1	of a foe of wattin s race 
1	that the pride
1	may be humbled hence for ever throughout tirawley 
1	 i adjudge a seat in every barrett s hall
1	to macwilliam in every stable i give a stall
1	to macwilliam and beside 
1	whenever a burke shall ride
1	through tirawley i provide
1	at his call
1	needful grooming 
1	without charge from any brughaidh of tirawley 
1	 thus lawfully i avenge me for the throes
1	ye lawlessly caused me and caused those
1	unhappy shame faced ones
1	who their mothers expected once 
1	would have been the sires of sons 
1	o er whose woes
1	often weeping 
1	i have groaned in my exile from tirawley 
1	 i demand not of you your manhoods but i take 
1	for the burkes will take it your freedom for the sake
1	of which all manhood s given
1	and all good under heaven 
1	and without which better even
1	you should make
1	yourselves barren 
1	than see your children slaves throughout tirawley 
1	 neither take i your eyesight from you as you took
1	mine and ours i would have you daily look
1	on one another s eyes
1	when the strangers tyrannize
1	by your hearths and blushes arise 
1	that ye brook
1	without vengeance
1	the insults of troops of tibbots throughout tirawley 
1	 the vengeance i designed now is done 
1	and the days of me and mine nearly run 
1	for for this i have broken faith 
1	teaching him who lies beneath
1	this pall to merit death 
1	and my son
1	to his father
1	stands pledged for other teaching in tirawley 
1	said macwilliam father and son hang them high 
1	and the lynott they hang d speedily 
1	but across the salt water 
1	to scotland with the daughter
1	of macwilliam well you got her 
1	did you fly
1	the gentlest of all the welshmen of tirawley 
1	 tis thus the ancient ollaves of erin tell
1	how through lewdness and revenge it befell
1	that the sons of william conquer
1	came over the sons of wattin 
1	throughout all the bounds and borders
1	of the lands of auley mac fiachra 
1	and his valiant bible guided 
1	free heretics of clan london
1	coming in in their succession 
1	rooted out both burke and barrett 
1	and in their empty places
1	new stems of freedom planted 
1	with many a goodly sapling
1	of manliness and virtue 
1	which while their children cherish 
1	may the mighty god of freedom
1	speed them well 
1	never taking
1	further vengeance on his people of tirawley 
1	they heaved the stone they heap d the cairn 
1	said ossian in a queenly grave
1	we leave her mong her fields of fern 
1	between the cliff and wave 
1	 the cliff behind stands clear and bare 
1	and bare above the heathery steep
1	scales the clear heaven s expanse to where
1	the danaan druids sleep 
1	 and all the sands that left and right 
1	the grassy isthmus ridge confine 
1	in yellow bars lie bare and bright
1	among the sparkling brine 
1	 a clear pure air pervades the scene 
1	in loneliness and awe secure 
1	meet spot to sepulchre a queen
1	who in her life was pure 
1	 here far from camp and chase removed 
1	apart in nature s quiet room 
1	the music that alive she loved
1	shall cheer her in the tomb 
1	 the humming of the noontide bees 
1	the lark s loud carol all day long 
1	and borne on evening s salted breeze 
1	the clanking sea bird s song 
1	 shall round her airy chamber float 
1	and with the whispering winds and streams 
1	attune to nature s tenderest note
1	the tenor of her dreams 
1	 and oft at tranquil eve s decline 
1	when full tides lip the old green plain 
1	the lowing of moynalty s kine
1	shall round her breathe again 
1	 in sweet remembrance of the days
1	when duteous in the lowly vale 
1	unconscious of my oscar s gaze 
1	she fill d the fragrant pail 
1	 and duteous from the running brook
1	drew water for the bath nor deem d
1	a king did on her labour look 
1	and she a fairy seem d 
1	 but when the wintry frosts begin 
1	and in their long drawn lofty flight 
1	the wild geese with their airy din

1	 and when the fierce de danaan ghosts
1	at midnight from their peak come down 
1	when all around the enchanted coasts
1	despairing strangers drown 
1	 when mingling with the wreckful wail 
1	from low clontarf s wave trampled floor
1	comes booming up the burthen d gale
1	the angry sand bull s roar 
1	 or angrier than the sea the shout
1	of erin s hosts in wrath combined 
1	when terror heads oppression s rout 
1	and freedom cheers behind 
1	 then o er our lady s placid dream 
1	where safe from storms she sleeps may steal
1	such joy as will not misbeseem
1	a queen of men to feel 
1	 such thrill of free defiant pride 
1	as rapt her in her battle car
1	at gavra when by oscar s side
1	she rode the ridge of war 
1	 exulting down the shouting troops 
1	and through the thick confronting kings 
1	with hands on all their javelin loops
1	and shafts on all their strings 
1	 e er closed the inseparable crowds 
1	no more to part for me and show

1	 and here hard by her natal bower
1	on lone ben edar s side we strive
1	with lifted rock and sign of power
1	to keep her name alive 
1	 that while from circling year to year 
1	her ogham letter d stone is seen 
1	the gael shall say our fenians here
1	entombed their loved aideen 
1	 the ogham from her pillar stone
1	in tract of time will wear away

1	with unimagined towers 
1	 and baying hounds and coursers bright 
1	and burnish d cars of dazzling sheen 
1	with courtly train of dame and knight 
1	where now the fern is green 
1	 or by yon prostrate altar stone
1	may kneel perchance and free from blame 
1	new holy men with rites unknown

1	 farewell the strength of men is worn 
1	the night approaches dark and chill

1	of oscar and aideen bereft 
1	so ossian s song the fenians sped
1	three mighty shouts to heaven and left
1	ben edar to the dead 
1	the lions of the hill are gone 
1	and i am left alone alone

1	of their greyhounds at their feet 
1	many a time for me have they
1	brought the tall red deer to bay

1	till a ruined church before me opened wide its ancient door 
1	till i stood before the portals where of old were wont to be 
1	for the blind the halt and leper alms and hospitality 
1	still the ancient seat was standing built against the buttress
1	grey 
1	where the clergy used to welcome weary trav llers on their way 
1	there i sat me down in sadness neath my cheek i placed my hand 
1	there i said in woful sorrow weeping bitterly the while 
1	empty aisle deserted chancel tower tottering to your fall

1	holy house of ivied gables that were once the country s boast

1	mournfully sing mournfully 
1	 o listen ellen sister dear

1	and let the spirits work their will 
1	i care not if for good or ill 
1	so they but lay the memory
1	which all my heart is haunting still 
1	 mournfully sing mournfully 
1	the fairies are a silent race 
1	and pale as lily flowers to see 
1	i care not for a blanched face

1	to this unholy grief i pray 
1	which makes me sick at heart to know 
1	and i will help you if i may 
1	lie nearer me i tremble so 
1	una i ve heard wise women say
1	 hearken to my tale of woe 
1	that if before the dews arise 
1	true maiden in its icy flow
1	with pure hand bathe her bosom thrice 
1	three lady brackens pluck likewise 
1	and three times round the fountain go 
1	she straight forgets her tears and sighs 
1	hearken to my tale of woe 
1	all alas and well away 
1	 o sister ellen sister sweet

1	they rose with soft
1	they left their mother where she lay 
1	their mother and her care discreet 
1	 all alas and well away 
1	and soon they reached the fairy well 
1	the mountain s eye clear cold and grey 
1	wide open in the dreary fell 
1	how long they stood twere vain to tell 
1	at last upon the point of day 
1	bawn una bares her bosom s swell 
1	 all alas and well away 
1	thrice o er her shrinking breasts she laves
1	the gliding glance that will not stay
1	of subtly streaming fairy waves 
1	and now the charm three brackens craves 
1	she plucks them in their fring d array 
1	now round the well her fate she braves 
1	all alas and well away 
1	save us all from fairy thrall 
1	ellen sees her face the rim
1	twice and thrice and that is all 
1	fount and hill and maiden swim
1	all together melting dim 
1	 una una thou may st call 
1	sister sad but lith or limb
1	 save us all from fairy thrall 
1	never again of una bawn 
1	where now she walks in dreamy hall 
1	shall eyes of mortal look upon 
1	o can it be the guard was gone 
1	that better guard than shield or wall 
1	who knows on earth save jurlagh daune 
1	 save us all from fairy thrall 
1	behold the banks are green and bare 
1	no pit is here wherein to fall 
1	aye at the fount you well may stare 
1	but nought save pebbles smooth is there 
1	and small straws twirling one and all 
1	hie thee home and be thy prayer 
1	save us all from fairy thrall 
1	i walked through ballinderry in the spring time 
1	when the bud was on the tree 
1	and i said in every fresh ploughed field beholding
1	the sowers striding free 
1	scattering broad cast forth the corn in golden plenty
1	on the quick seed clasping soil 
1	even such this day among the fresh stirred hearts of erin 
1	thomas davis is thy toil 
1	i sat by ballyshannon in the summer 
1	and saw the salmon leap 
1	and i said as i beheld the gallant creatures
1	spring glittering from the deep 
1	through the spray and through the prone heaps striving onward
1	to the calm clear streams above 
1	so seekest thou thy native founts of freedom thomas davis 
1	in thy brightness of strength and love 
1	i stood on derrybawn in the autumn 
1	i heard the eagle call 
1	with a clangorous cry of wrath and lamentation
1	that filled the wide mountain hall 
1	o er the bare deserted place of his plundered eyrie 
1	and i said as he screamed and soared 
1	so callest thou thou wrathful soaring thomas davis 
1	for a nation s rights restored 
1	and alas to think but now and thou art lying 
1	dear davis dead at thy mother s knee 
1	and i no mother near on my own sick bed 
1	i may lie and try to feel that i am not dreaming 
1	i may lie and try to say thy will be done 
1	but a hundred such as i will never comfort erin
1	for the loss of the noble son 
1	young husbandman of erin s fruitful seed time 
1	in the fresh track of danger s plough 
1	who will walk the heavy toilsome perilous furrow
1	girt with freedom s seed sheets now 
1	who will banish with the wholesome crop of knowledge
1	the flaunting weed and the bitter thorn 
1	now that thou thyself art but a seed for hopeful planting
1	against the resurrection morn 
1	young salmon of the flood time of freedom
1	that swells round erin s shore 
1	thou wilt leap against their loud oppressive torrent
1	of bigotry and hate no more 
1	drawn downward by their prone material instinct 
1	let them thunder on their rocks and foam 
1	thou hast leapt aspiring soul to founts beyond their raging 
1	where troubled waters never come 
1	but i grieve not eagle of the empty eyrie 
1	that thy wrathful cry is still 
1	and that the songs alone of peaceful mourners
1	are heard to day on erin s hill 
1	better far if brothers war be destined for us
1	 god avert that horrid day i pray 
1	that ere our hands be stained with slaughter fratricidal
1	thy warm heart should be cold in clay 
1	but my trust is strong in god who made us brothers 
1	that he will not suffer those right hands
1	which thou hast joined in holier rites than wedlock 
1	to draw opposing brands 
1	o many a tuneful tongue that thou madest vocal
1	would lie cold and silent then 
1	and songless long once more should often widowed erin
1	mourn the loss of her brave young men 
1	o brave young men my love my pride my promise 
1	 tis on you my hopes are set 
1	in manliness in kindliness in justice 
1	to make erin a nation yet 
1	self respecting self relying self advancing 
1	in union or in severance free and strong 
1	and if god grant this then under god to thomas davis
1	let the greater praise belong 
1	on the deck of patrick lynch s boat i sat in woful plight 
1	through my sighing all the weary day and weeping all the night 
1	were it not that full of sorrow from my people forth i go 
1	by the blessed sun tis royally i d sing thy praise mayo 
1	when i dwelt at home in plenty and my gold did much abound 
1	in the company of fair young maids the spanish ale went round 
1	they are altered girls in irrul now tis proud they re grown
1	and high 
1	with their hair bags and their top knots for i pass their
1	buckles by 
1	but it s little now i heed their airs for god will have it so 
1	that i must depart for foreign lands and leave my sweet mayo 
1	 tis my grief that patrick loughlin is not earl of irrul still 
1	and that brian duff no longer rules as lord upon the hill 
1	and that colonel hugh macgrady should be lying dead and low 
1	and i sailing sailing swiftly from the county of mayo 
1	 a girl s babble 
1	i go to knit two clans together 
1	our clan and this clan unseen of yore 
1	our clan fears nought but i go o whither 
1	this day i go from my mother s door 
1	thou red breast singest the old song over 
1	though many a time thou hast sung it before 
1	they never sent thee to some strange new lover 
1	i sing a new song by my mother s door 
1	i stepped from my little room down by the ladder 
1	the ladder that never so shook before 
1	i was sad last night to day i am sadder 
1	because i go from my mother s door 
1	the last snow melts upon bush and bramble 
1	the gold bars shine on the forest s floor 
1	shake not thou leaf it is i must tremble
1	because i go from my mother s door 
1	from a spanish sailor a dagger i bought me 
1	i trailed a rose tree our grey bawn o er 
1	the creed and my letters our old bard taught me 
1	my days were sweet by my mother s door 
1	my little white goat that with raised feet huggest
1	the oak stock thy horns in the ivies frore 
1	could i wrestle like thee how the wreaths thou tuggest 
1	i never would move from my mother s door 
1	o weep no longer my nurse and mother 
1	my foster sister weep not so sore 
1	you cannot come with me ir my brother 
1	alone i go from my mother s door 
1	farewell my wolf hound that slew macowing
1	as he caught me and far through the thickets bore 
1	my heifer alb in the green vale lowing 
1	my cygnet s nest upon lorna s shore 
1	he has killed ten chiefs this chief that plights me 
1	his hand is like that of the giant balor 
1	but i fear his kiss and his beard affrights me 
1	and the great stone dragon above his door 
1	had i daughters nine with me they should tarry 
1	they should sing old songs they should dance at my door 
1	they should grind at the quern no need to marry 
1	o when will this marriage day be o er 
1	had i buried like moirin three mates already 
1	i might say three husbands then why not four 
1	but my hand is cold and my foot unsteady 
1	because i never was married before 
1	the little black rose shall be red at last 
1	what made it black but the march wind dry 
1	and the tear of the widow that fell on it fast 
1	it shall redden the hills when june is nigh 
1	the silk of the kine shall rest at last 
1	what drove her forth but the dragon fly 
1	in the golden vale she shall feed full fast 
1	with her mild gold horn and her slow dark eye 
1	the wounded wood dove lies dead at last 
1	the pine long bleeding it shall not die 
1	this song is secret mine ear it passed
1	in a wind o er the plains at athenry 
1	she says poor friend you waste a treasure
1	which you can ne er regain 
1	time health and glory for the pleasure
1	of toying with a chain 
1	but then her voice so tender grows 
1	so kind and so caressing 
1	each murmur from her lips that flows
1	comes to me like a blessing 
1	sometimes she says sweet friend i grieve you 
1	alas it gives me pain 
1	what can i ah might i relieve you 
1	you ne er had mourned in vain 
1	and then her little hand she presses
1	upon her heart and sighs 
1	while tears whose source not yet she guesses 
1	grow larger in her eyes 
1	here i bide at the foot of the hill 
1	i am clansman to brian and servant to none 
1	whom i hated i hate whom i loved i love still 
1	blind am i on milk i live 
1	and meat god sends it on each saint s day 
1	though donald mac art may he never thrive 
1	last shrovetide drove half my kine away 
1	at the brown hill s base by the pale blue lake
1	i dwell and see the things i saw 
1	the heron flap heavily up from the brake 
1	the crow fly homeward with twig or straw
1	the wild duck a silver line in wake
1	cutting the calm mere to far bunaw 
1	and the things that i heard though deaf i hear 
1	from the tower in the island the feastful cheer 
1	the horn from the wood the plunge of the stag 
1	with the loud hounds after him down from the crag 
1	sweet is the chase but the battle is sweeter 
1	more healthy more joyous for true men meeter 
1	my hand is weak it once was strong 
1	my heart burns still with its ancient fire 
1	if any man smites me he does me wrong 
1	for i was the bard of brian mac guire 
1	if any man slay me not unaware 
1	by no chance blow nor in wine and revel 
1	i have stored beforehand a curse in my prayer
1	for his kith and kindred his deed is evil 
1	there never was king and never will be 
1	in battle or banquet like malachi 
1	the seers his reign had predicted long 
1	he honoured the bards and gave gold for song 
1	if rebels arose he put out their eyes 
1	if robbers plundered or burned the fanes 
1	he hung them in chaplets like rosaries 
1	that others beholding might take more pains 
1	there was none to women more reverent minded 
1	for he held his mother and mary dear 
1	if any man wronged them that man he blinded 
1	or straight amerced him of hand or ear 
1	there was none who founded more convents none 
1	in his palace the old and poor were fed 
1	the orphan might walk or the widow s son 
1	without groom or page to his throne or bed 
1	in his council he mused with great brows divine 
1	and eyes like the eyes of the musing kine 
1	upholding a sceptre o er which men said 
1	seven spirits of wisdom like fire tongues played 
1	he drained ten lakes and he built ten bridges 
1	he bought a gold book for a thousand cows 
1	he slew ten princes who brake their pledges 
1	with the bribed and the base he scorned to carouse 
1	he was sweet and awful through all his reign
1	god gave great harvests to vale and plain 
1	from his nurse s milk he was kind and brave 
1	and when he went down to his well wept grave 
1	through the triumph of penance his soul arose
1	to god and the saints not so his foes 
1	the king that came after ah woe woe woe 
1	he doubted his friend and he trusted his foe 
1	he bought and he sold his kingdom old
1	he pledged and pawned to avenge a spite 
1	no bard or prophet his birth foretold 
1	he was guarded and warded both day and night 
1	he counselled with fools and had boors at his feast 
1	he was cruel to christian and kind to beast 
1	men smiled when they talked of him far o er the wave 
1	well paid were the mourners that wept at his grave 
1	god plagued for his sake his people sore 
1	they sinned for the people should watch and pray 
1	that their prayers like angels at window and door 
1	may keep from the king the bad thought away 
1	the sun has risen on lip and brow 
1	he greets me i feel it with golden wand 
1	ah bright faced norna i see thee now 
1	where first i saw thee i see thee stand 
1	from the trellis the girl looked down on me 
1	her maidens stood near it was late in spring 
1	the grey priest laughed as she cried in glee 
1	 good bard a song in my honour sing 
1	i sang her praise in a loud voiced hymn 
1	to god who had fashioned her face and limb 
1	for the praise of the clan and the land s behoof 
1	so she flung me a flower from the trellis roof 
1	ere long i saw her the hill descending 
1	o er the lake the may morning rose moist and slow 
1	she prayed me her smile with the sweet voice blending 
1	to teach her all that a woman should know 
1	panting she stood she was out of breath 
1	the wave of her little breast was shaking 
1	from eyes still childish and dark as death 
1	came womanhood s dawn through a dew cloud breaking 
1	norna was never long time the same 
1	by a spirit so strong was her slight form moulded 
1	the curves swelled out from the flower like frame
1	in joy in grief to a bud she folded 
1	as she listened her eyes grew bright and large 
1	like springs rain fed that dilate their marge 
1	so i taught her the hymn of patrick the apostle 
1	and the marvels of bridget and columbkille 
1	ere long she sang like the lark or the throstle 
1	sang the deeds of the servants of god s high will 
1	i told her of brendan who found afar
1	another world neath the western star 
1	of our three great bishops in lindisfarne isle 
1	of st fursey the wondrous fiacre without guile 
1	of sedulius hymn maker when hymns were rare 
1	of scotus the subtle who clove a hair
1	into sixty parts and had marge to spare 
1	to her brother i spake of oisin and fionn 
1	and they wept at the death of great oisin s son 
1	i taught the heart of the boy to revel
1	in tales of old greatness that never tire 
1	and the virgin s up springing from earth s low level 
1	to wed with heaven like the altar fire 
1	i taught her all that a woman should know 
1	and that none should teach her worse lore i gave her
1	a dagger keen and taught her the blow
1	that subdues the knave to discreet behaviour 
1	a sand stone there on my knee she set 
1	and sharpened its point i can see her yet
1	i held back her hair and she sharpen d the edge 
1	while the wind piped low through the reeds and sedge 
1	she died in the convent on ina s height 
1	i saw her the day that she took the veil 
1	as slender she stood as the paschal light 
1	as tall and slender and bright and pale 
1	i saw her and dropped as dead bereaven
1	is earth when her holy ones leave her for heaven 
1	her brother fell in the fight at begh 
1	may they plead for me both on my dying day 
1	all praise to the man who brought us the faith 
1	 tis a staff by day and our pillow in death 
1	all praise i say to that blessed youth 
1	who heard in a dream from tyrawley s strand
1	that wail put forth o er the sea thy hand 
1	in the dark we die give us hope and truth 
1	but patrick built not on iorras shore
1	that convent where now the franciscans dwell 
1	columba was mighty in prayer and war 
1	but the young monk preaches as loud as his bell 
1	that love must rule all and all wrongs be forgiven 
1	or else he is sure we shall reach not heaven 
1	this doctrine i count right cruel and hard 
1	and when i am laid in the old churchyard 
1	the habit of francis i will not wear 
1	nor wear i his cord or his cloth of hair
1	in secret men dwindle till psalm and prayer
1	had softened the land no dane dwelt there 
1	i forgive old cathbar who sank my boat 
1	must i pardon feargal who slew my son 
1	or the pirate strongbow who burned granote 
1	they tell me and in it nine priests a nun 
1	and worse st finian s old crozier staff 
1	at forgiveness like that i spit and laugh 
1	my chief in his wine cups forgave twelve men 
1	and of these a dozen rebelled again 
1	there never was chief more brave than he 
1	the night he was born loch gar up burst 
1	he was bard loving gift making fond of glee 
1	the last to fly to advance the first 
1	he was like the top spray upon uladh s oak 
1	he was like the tap root of argial s pine 
1	he was secret and sudden as lightning his stroke 
1	there was none that could fathom his hid design 
1	he slept not if any man scorned his alliance
1	he struck the first blow for a frank defiance 
1	with that look in his face half night half light 
1	like the lake just blackened yet ridged with white 
1	there were comely wonders before he died 
1	the eagle barked and the banshee cried 
1	the witch elm wept with a blighted bud 
1	the spray of the torrent was red with blood 
1	the chief returned from the mountains bound 
1	forgot to ask after bran his hound 
1	we knew he would die three days were o er 
1	he died we waked him for three days more 
1	one by one upon brow and breast 
1	the whole clan kissed him in peace may he rest 
1	i sang his dirge i could sing that time
1	four thousand staves of ancestral rhyme 
1	to day i can scarcely sing the half 
1	of old i was corn and i now am chaff 
1	my song to day is a breeze that shakes
1	feebly the down on the cygnet s breast 
1	 twas then a billow the beach that rakes 
1	or a storm that buffets the mountain s crest 
1	whatever i bit with a venomed song 
1	grew sick were it beast or tree or man 
1	the wronged one sued me to right his wrong
1	with the flail of the satire and fierce ode s fan 
1	i sang to the chieftains each stock i traced 
1	lest lines should grow tangled through fraud or haste 
1	to princes i sang in a loftier tone
1	of moran the just who refused a throne 
1	of moran whose torque would close and choke
1	the wry necked witness that falsely spoke 
1	i taught them how to win love and hate 
1	not love from all and to shun debate 
1	to maids in the bower i sang of love 
1	and of war at the feastings in bawn or grove 
1	great is our order but greater far
1	were its pomp and power in the days of old 
1	when the five chief bards in peace or war
1	had thirty bards each in his train enrolled 
1	when ollave fodla in tara s hall
1	fed bards and kings when the boy king nial
1	was trained by torna when britain and gaul
1	sent crowns of laurel to dallan forgial 
1	to day we can launch the clans into fight 
1	that day we could freeze them in mid career 
1	whatever man knows was our realm by right 
1	the lore without music no gael would hear 
1	old cormac the brave blind king was bard
1	ere fame rose yet of o daly and ward 
1	the son of milesius was bard go back
1	my people he sang ye have done a wrong 
1	nine waves go back o er the green sea track 
1	let your foes their castles and coasts make strong 
1	to the island you came by stealth and at night 
1	she is ours if we win her in all men s sight 
1	for that first song s sake let our bards hold fast
1	to truth and justice from first to last 
1	 tis over some think we erred through pride 
1	though columba the vengeance turned aside 
1	too strong we were not too rich we were 
1	give wealth to knaves tis the true man s snare 
1	but now men lie they are just no more 
1	they forsake the old ways they quest for new 
1	they pry and they snuff after strange false lore 
1	as dogs hunt vermin it never was true 
1	i have scorned it for twenty years this babble 
1	that eastward and southward a saxon rabble
1	have won great battles and rule large lands 
1	and plight with daughters of ours their hands 
1	we know the bold norman o erset their throne
1	long since our lands let them guard their own 
1	how long he leaves me the great god here 
1	have i sinned some sin or has god forgotten 
1	this year i think is my hundredth year 
1	i am like a bad apple unripe and rotten 
1	they shall lift me ere long they shall lay me the clan 
1	by the strength of men on mount cruachan 
1	god has much to think of how much he hath seen 
1	and how much is gone by that once hath been 
1	on sandy hills where the rabbits burrow 
1	are raths of kings men named not now 
1	on mountain tops i have tracked the furrow 
1	and found in forests the buried plough 
1	for one now living the strong land then
1	gave kindly food and raiment to ten 
1	no doubt they waxed proud and their god defied 
1	so their harvest he blighted and burned their hoard 
1	or he sent them plagues or he sent the sword 
1	or he sent them lightning and so they died 
1	like dathi the king on the dark alp s side 
1	ah me that man who is made of dust 
1	should have pride towards god tis a demon s spleen 
1	i have often feared lest god the all just 
1	should bend from heaven and sweep earth clean 
1	should sweep us all into corners and holes 
1	like dust of the house floor both bodies and souls 
1	i have often feared he would send some wind
1	in wrath and the nation wake up stone blind 
1	in age or in youth we have all wrought ill 
1	i say not our great king nial did well 
1	where besides subduing this land of eire 
1	he raised in armorica banner and sign 
1	and wasted the british coast with fire 
1	perhaps in his mercy the lord will say 
1	 these men god s help twas a rough boy play 
1	he is certain that young franciscan priest 
1	god sees great sin where men see least 
1	yet this were to give unto god the eye 
1	unmeet the thought of the humming fly 
1	i trust there are small things he scorns to see
1	in the lowly who cry to him piteously 
1	our hope is christ i have wept full oft 
1	he came not to eire in oisin s time 
1	though love and those new monks would make men soft 
1	if they were not hardened by war and rhyme 
1	i have done my part my end draws nigh 
1	i shall leave old eire with a smile and sigh 
1	she will miss me not as i missed my son 
1	yet for her and her praise were my best deeds done 
1	man s deeds man s deeds they are shades that fleet 
1	or ripples like those that break at my feet 
1	the deeds of my chief and the deeds of my king
1	grow hazy far seen in the hills in spring 
1	nothing is great save the death on the cross 
1	but pilate and herod i hate and know
1	had fionn lived then he had laid them low 
1	though the world thereby had sustained great loss 
1	my blindness and deafness and aching back
1	with meekness i bear for that suffering s sake 
1	and the lent fast for mary s sake i love 
1	and the honour of him the man above 
1	my songs are all over now so best 
1	they are laid in the heavenly singer s breast 
1	who never sings but a star is born 
1	may we hear his song in the endless morn 
1	i give glory to god for our battles won
1	by wood or river on bay or creek 
1	for norna who died for my father conn 
1	for feasts and the chase on the mountains bleak 
1	i bewail my sins both unknown and known 
1	and of those i have injured forgiveness seek 
1	the men that were wicked to me and mine
1	 not quenching a wrong nor in war nor wine 
1	i forgive and absolve them all save three 
1	may christ in his mercy be kind to me 
1	 did they dare did they dare to slay eoghan ruadh o neill 
1	 yes they slew with poison him they feared to meet with steel 
1	 may god wither up their hearts may their blood cease to flow 
1	may they walk in living death who poisoned eoghan ruadh 
1	 though it break my heart to hear say again the bitter words 
1	 from derry against cromwell he marched to measure swords 
1	but the weapon of the sassanach met him on his way 
1	and he died at cloch uachtar upon st leonard s day 
1	 wail wail ye for the mighty one wail wail ye for the dead 
1	holy saviour but to think we shall never see him more 
1	 sagest in the council was he kindest in the hall 
1	sure we never won a battle twas owen won them all 
1	had he lived had he lived our dear country had been free 
1	but he s dead but he s dead and tis slaves we ll ever be 
1	audley and macmahon ye are valiant wise and true 
1	but what are ye all to our darling who is gone 
1	the rudder of our ship was he our castle s corner stone 
1	 wail wail him through the island weep weep for our pride 
1	would that on the battle field our gallant chief had died 
1	weep the victor of beinn burb weep him young and old 
1	weep for him ye women your beautiful lies cold 
1	 we thought you would not die we were sure you would not go 
1	and leave us in our utmost need to cromwell s cruel blow 
1	sheep without a shepherd when the snow shuts out the sky 
1	o why did you leave us eoghan why did you die 
1	 soft as woman s was your voice o neill bright was your eye 
1	o why did you leave us eoghan why did you die 
1	your troubles are all over you re at rest with god on high 
1	but we re slaves and we re orphans eoghan why did you die 
1	in a valley far away 
1	with my maire bhan astor 
1	short would be the summer day 
1	ever loving more and more 
1	winter days would all grow long 
1	with the light her heart would pour 
1	with her kisses and her song 
1	and her loving mait go leor 
1	fond is maire bhan astor 
1	fair is maire bhan astor 
1	sweet as ripple on the shore 
1	sings my maire bhan astor 
1	o her sire is very proud 
1	and her mother cold as stone 
1	but her brother bravely vowed
1	she should be my bride alone 
1	for he knew i loved her well 
1	and he knew she loved me too 
1	so he sought their pride to quell 
1	but twas all in vain to sue 
1	true is maire bhan astor 
1	tried is maire bhan astor 
1	had i wings i d never soar
1	from my maire bhan astor 
1	there are lands where manly toil
1	surely reaps the crop it sows 
1	glorious woods and teeming soil 
1	where the broad missouri flows 
1	through the trees the smoke shall rise 
1	from our hearth with mait go leor 
1	there shall shine the happy eyes
1	of my maire bhan astor 
1	mild is maire bhan astor 
1	mine is maire bhan astor 
1	saints will watch about the door
1	of my maire bhan astor 
1	air the swaggering jig 
1	o the marriage the marriage 
1	with love and mo bhuachaill for me 
1	the ladies that ride in a carriage
1	might envy my marriage to me 
1	for eoghan is straight as a tower 
1	and tender and loving and true 
1	he told me more love in an hour
1	than the squires of the county could do 
1	then o the marriage etc 
1	his hair is a shower of soft gold 
1	his eye is as clear as the day 
1	his conscience and vote were unsold
1	when others were carried away 
1	his word is as good as an oath 
1	and freely twas given to me 
1	o sure twill be happy for both
1	the day of our marriage to see 
1	then o the marriage etc 
1	his kinsmen are honest and kind 
1	the neighbours think much of his skill 
1	and eoghan s the lad to my mind 
1	though he owns neither castle nor mill 
1	but he has a tilloch of land 
1	a horse and a stocking of coin 
1	a foot for a dance and a hand
1	in the cause of his country to join 
1	then o the marriage etc 
1	we meet in the market and fair 
1	we meet in the morning and night 
1	he sits on the half of my chair 
1	and my people are wild with delight 
1	yet i long through the winter to skim 
1	though eoghan longs more i can see 
1	when i will be married to him 
1	and he will be married to me 
1	then o the marriage the marriage 
1	with love and mo bhuachaill for me 
1	the ladies that ride in a carriage
1	might envy my marriage to me 
1	the summer brook flows in the bed 
1	the winter torrent tore asunder 
1	the skylark s gentle wings are spread
1	where walk the lightning and the thunder 
1	and thus you ll find the sternest soul
1	the gayest tenderness concealing 
1	and minds that seem to mock control 
1	are ordered by some fairy feeling 
1	then maiden start not from the hand
1	that s hardened by the swaying sabre 
1	the pulse beneath may be as bland
1	as evening after day of labour 
1	and maiden start not from the brow
1	that thought has knit and passion darkened 
1	in twilight hours neath forest bough 
1	the tenderest tales are often hearkened 
1	cold in the earth and the deep snow piled above thee 
1	far far removed cold in the dreary grave 
1	have i forgot my only love to love thee 
1	severed at last by time s all severing wave 
1	now when alone do my thoughts no longer hover
1	over the mountains on that northern shore 
1	resting their wings where heath and fern leaves cover
1	thy noble heart for ever ever more 
1	cold in the earth and fifteen wild decembers 
1	from these brown hills have melted into spring 
1	faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers
1	after such years of change and suffering 
1	sweet love of youth forgive if i forget thee 
1	while the world s tide is bearing me along 
1	other desires and other hopes beset me 
1	hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong 
1	no later light has lighted up my heaven 
1	no second morn has ever shone for me 
1	all my life s bliss from thy dear life was given 
1	all my life s bliss is in the grave with thee 
1	but when the days of golden dreams had perished 
1	and even despair was powerless to destroy 
1	then did i learn how existence could be cherished 
1	strengthened and fed without the aid of joy 
1	then did i check the tears of useless passion 
1	weaned my young soul from yearning after thine 
1	sternly denied its burning wish to hasten 
1	down to that tomb already more than mine 
1	and even yet i dare not let it languish 
1	dare not indulge in memory s rapturous pain 
1	once drinking deep of that divinest anguish
1	how could i seek the empty world again 
1	still let my tyrants know i am not doomed to wear
1	year after year in gloom and desolate despair 
1	a messenger of hope comes every night to me 
1	and offers for short life eternal liberty 
1	he comes with western winds with evening s wandering airs 
1	with that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars 
1	winds take a pensive tone and stars a tender fire 
1	and visions rise and change that kill me with desire 
1	desire for nothing known in my maturer years 
1	when joy grew mad with awe at counting future tears 
1	when if my spirit s sky was full of flashes warm 
1	i knew not whence they came from sun or thunderstorm 
1	but first a hush of peace a soundless calm descends 
1	the struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends 
1	mute music soothes my breast unuttered harmony
1	that i could never dream till earth was lost to me 
1	then dawns the invisible the unseen its truth reveals 
1	my outward sense is gone my inward essence feels 
1	its wings are almost free its home its harbour found 
1	measuring the gulf it stoops and dares the final bound 
1	o dreadful is the check intense the agony 
1	when the ear begins to hear and the eye begins to see 
1	when the pulse begins to throb the brain to think again 
1	the soul to feel the flesh and the flesh to feel the chain 
1	yet i would lose no sting would wish no torture less 
1	the more that anguish racks the earlier it will bless 
1	and robed in fires of hell or bright with heavenly shine 
1	if it but herald death the vision is divine 
1	no coward soul is mine 
1	no trembler in the world s storm troubled sphere 
1	i see heaven s glories shine 
1	and faith shines equal arming me from fear 
1	o god within my breast 
1	almighty ever present deity 
1	life that in me has rest 
1	as i undying life have power in thee 
1	vain are the thousand creeds
1	that move men s hearts unutterably vain 
1	worthless as withered weeds 
1	or idlest froth amid the boundless main 
1	to waken doubt in one
1	holding so fast to thine infinity 
1	so surely anchored on
1	the steadfast rock of immortality 
1	with wide embracing love
1	thy spirit animates eternal years 
1	pervades and broods above 
1	changes sustains dissolves creates and rears 
1	though earth and man were gone 
1	and suns and universes ceased to be 
1	and thou were left alone 
1	every existence would exist in thee 
1	there is not room for death 
1	nor atom that his might could render void 
1	and what thou art may never be destroyed 
1	who fears to speak of ninety eight 
1	who blushes at the name 
1	when cowards mock the patriot s fate 
1	who hangs his head for shame 
1	he s all a knave or half a slave
1	who slights his country thus 
1	but a true man like you man 
1	will fill your glass with us 
1	we drink the memory of the brave 
1	the faithful and the few 
1	some lie far off beyond the wave 
1	some sleep in ireland too 
1	all all are gone but still lives on
1	the fame of those who died 
1	all true men like you men 
1	remember them with pride 
1	some on the shores of distant lands
1	their weary hearts have laid 
1	and by the stranger s heedless hands
1	their lonely graves were made 
1	but though their clay be far away
1	beyond the atlantic foam 
1	in true men like you men 
1	their spirit s still at home 
1	the dust of some is irish earth 
1	among their own they rest 
1	and the same land that gave them birth
1	has caught them to her breast 
1	and we will pray that from their clay
1	full many a race may start
1	of true men like you men 
1	to act as brave a part 
1	they rose in dark and evil days
1	to right their native land 
1	they kindled here a living blaze
1	that nothing shall withstand 
1	alas that might can vanquish right 
1	 they fell and passed away 
1	but true men like you men 
1	are plenty here to day 
1	then here s their memory may it be
1	for us a guiding light 
1	to cheer our strife for liberty 
1	and teach us to unite 
1	through good and ill be ireland s still 
1	though sad as theirs your fate 
1	and true men be you men 
1	like those of ninety eight 
1	adieu to ballyshanny where i was bred and born 
1	go where i may i ll think of you as sure as night and morn 
1	the kindly spot the friendly town where every one is known 
1	and not a face in all the place but partly seems my own 
1	there s not a house or window there s not a field or hill 
1	but east or west in foreign lands i ll recollect them still 
1	i leave my warm heart with you tho my back i m forced to turn 
1	no more on pleasant evenings we ll saunter down the mall 
1	when the trout is rising to the fly the salmon to the fall 
1	the boat comes straining on her net and heavily she creeps 
1	till a silver wave of salmon rolls in among the crew 
1	the music of the waterfall the mirror of the tide 
1	when all the green hill d harbour is full from side to side 
1	from portnasun to bulliebawns and round the abbey bay 
1	from rocky inis saimer to coolnargit sandhills gray 
1	while far upon the southern line to guard it like a wall 
1	the leitrim mountains clothed in blue gaze calmly over all 
1	and watch the ship sail up or down the red flag at her stern 
1	adieu to these adieu to all the winding banks of erne 
1	farewell to you kildoney lads and them that pull an oar 
1	a lug sail set or haul a net from the point to mullaghmore 
1	from killybegs to bold slieve league that ocean mountain steep 
1	six hundred yards in air aloft six hundred in the deep 
1	from dooran to the fairy bridge and round by tullen strand 
1	adieu to all the billowy coast and winding banks of erne 
1	farewell coolmore bundoran and your summer crowds that run
1	from inland homes to see with joy th atlantic setting sun 
1	to breathe the buoyant salted air and sport among the waves 
1	to gather shells on sandy beach and tempt the gloomy caves 
1	the sick and old in search of health for all things have
1	their turn 
1	and i must quit my native shore and the winding banks of erne 
1	farewell to every white cascade from the harbour to belleek 
1	and every pool where fins may rest and ivy shaded creek 
1	the sloping fields the lofty rocks where ash and holly grow 
1	the one split yew tree gazing on the curving flood below 
1	the lough that winds through islands under turaw mountain green 
1	for i must say adieu adieu to the winding banks of erne 
1	the girls will bring their work and sing beneath a twisted thorn 
1	along the river side they go where i have often been 
1	o never shall i see again the days that i have seen 
1	a thousand chances are to one i never may return 
1	adieu to ballyshanny and the winding banks of erne 
1	adieu to evening dances when merry neighbours meet 
1	who trench d the rath on such a hill and where the bones may lie
1	and tender ditties sweetly sung to pass the twilight hour 
1	the mournful song of exile is now for me to learn 
1	adieu my dear companions on the winding banks of erne 
1	now measure from the commons down to each end of the purt 
1	round the abbey moy and knather i wish no one any hurt 
1	i hope that man and womankind will do the same by me 
1	for my heart is sore and heavy at voyaging the sea 
1	my loving friends i ll bear in mind and often fondly turn
1	to think of ballyshanny and the winding banks of erne 
1	if ever i m a money d man i mean please god to cast
1	my golden anchor in the place where youthful years were past 
1	though heads that now are black and brown must meanwhile
1	gather gray 
1	new faces rise by every hearth and old ones drop away 
1	yet dearer still that irish hill than all the world beside 
1	it s home sweet home where er i roam through lands and
1	waters wide 
1	and if the lord allows me i surely will return
1	to my native ballyshanny and the winding banks of erne 
1	up the airy mountain 
1	down the rushy glen 
1	we daren t go a hunting
1	for fear of little men 
1	wee folk good folk 
1	trooping all together 
1	green jacket red cap 
1	and white owl s feather 
1	down along the rocky shore
1	some make their home 
1	they live on crispy pancakes 
1	of yellow tide foam 
1	some in the reeds
1	of the bleak mountain lake 
1	with frogs for their watch dogs 
1	all night awake 
1	high on the hill top
1	the old king sits 
1	he is now so old and gray
1	he s nigh lost his wits 
1	with a bridge of white mist
1	columbkill he crosses 
1	on his stately journeys
1	or going up with music
1	on cold starry nights 
1	to sup with the queen
1	they stole little bridget
1	for seven years long 
1	when she came down again
1	her friends were all gone 
1	they took her lightly back 
1	between the night and morrow 
1	they thought that she was fast asleep 
1	but she was dead with sorrow 
1	they have kept her ever since
1	deep within the lake 
1	on a bed of flag leaves 
1	watching till she wake 
1	by the craggy hillside
1	through the mosses bare 
1	they have planted thorn trees
1	for pleasure here and there 
1	if any man so daring
1	as dig them up in spite 
1	he shall find their sharpest thorns
1	in his bed at night 
1	up the airy mountain 
1	down the rushy glen 
1	we daren t go a hunting
1	for fear of little men 
1	wee folk good folk 
1	trooping all together 
1	green jacket red cap 
1	and white owl s feather 
1	the abbot of inisfalen awoke ere dawn of day 
1	under the dewy green leaves went he forth to pray 
1	the lake around his island lay smooth and dark and deep 
1	and wrapped in a misty stillness the mountains were all asleep 
1	low kneel d the abbot cormac when the dawn was dim and gray 
1	the prayers of his holy office he faithfully gan say 
1	low kneel d the abbot cormac while the dawn was waxing red 
1	and for his sins forgiveness a solemn prayer he said 
1	low kneel d that holy abbot while the dawn was waking clear 
1	and he prayed with loving kindness for his convent brethren dear 
1	he pray d a prayer for all men he pray d it from his heart 
1	his blissful soul was in heaven tho a breathing man was he 
1	he was out of time s dominion so far as the living may be 
1	the abbot of inisfalen arose upon his feet 
1	he heard a small bird singing and o but it sung sweet 
1	it sung upon a holly bush this little snow white bird 
1	a song so full of gladness he never before had heard 
1	it sung upon a hazel it sung upon a thorn 
1	he had never heard such music since the hour that he was born 
1	it sung upon a sycamore it sung upon a briar 
1	to follow the song and hearken the abbot would never tire 
1	till at last he well bethought him he might no longer stay 
1	so he bless d the little white singing bird and gladly went
1	his way 
1	the strange men spoke unto him and he heard from all and each
1	the foreign tongue of the sassenach not wholesome irish speech 
1	then the oldest monk came forward in irish tongue spake he 
1	 thou wearest the holy augustine s dress and who hath given
1	it to thee 
1	 i wear the holy augustine s dress and cormac is my name 
1	the abbot of this good abbey by grace of god i am 
1	i went forth to pray at the dawn of day and when my prayers
1	were said 
1	i hearken d awhile to a little bird that sang above my head 
1	the monks to him made answer two hundred years have gone o er 
1	since our abbot cormac went through the gate and never was
1	heard of more 
1	matthias now is our abbot and twenty have pass d away 
1	the stranger is lord of ireland we live in an evil day 
1	days will come and go he said and the world will pass away 
1	in heaven a day is a thousand years a thousand years are a day 
1	 now give me absolution for my time is come said he 
1	and they gave him absolution as speedily as might be 
1	then close outside the window the sweetest song they heard
1	that ever yet since the world began was utter d by any bird 
1	the monks look d out and saw the bird its feathers all white
1	and clean 
1	and then in a moment beside it another white bird was seen 
1	those two they sang together waved their white wings and fled 
1	flew aloft and vanish d but the good old man was dead 
1	they buried his blessed body where lake and green sward meet 
1	a carven cross above his head a holly bush at his feet 
1	where spreads the beautiful water to gay or cloudy skies 
1	and the purple peaks of killarney from ancient woods arise 
1	now at the hour when ignorant mortals
1	drowse in the shade of their whirling sphere 
1	heaven and hell from invisible portals
1	breathing comfort and ghastly fear 
1	voices i hear 
1	i hear strange voices flitting calling 
1	wavering by on the dusky blast 
1	 come let us go for the night is falling 
1	come let us go for the day is past 
1	troops of joys are they now departed 
1	winged hopes that no longer stay 
1	guardian spirits grown weary hearted 
1	powers that have linger d their latest day 
1	what do they say 
1	what do they sing i hear them calling 
1	whispering gathering flying fast 
1	 come come for the night is falling 
1	come come for the day is past 
1	sing they to me thy taper s wasted 
1	mortal thy sands of life run low 
1	thine hours like a flock of birds have hasted 
1	time is ending we go we go 
1	sing they so 
1	mystical voices floating calling 
1	dim farewells the last the last 
1	 come come away the night is falling 
1	come come away the day is past 
1	see i am ready twilight voices 
1	child of the spirit world am i 
1	how should i fear you my soul rejoices 
1	o speak plainer o draw nigh 
1	fain would i fly 
1	tell me your message ye who are calling
1	out of the dimness vague and vast 
1	lift me take me the night is falling 
1	quick let us go the day is past 
1	four ducks on a pond 
1	a grass bank beyond 
1	a blue sky of spring 
1	white clouds on the wing 
1	what a little thing
1	to remember for years 
1	to remember with tears 
1	within a budding grove 
1	in april s ear sang every bird his best 
1	but not a song to pleasure my unrest 
1	or touch the tears unwept of bitter love 
1	some spake methought with pity some as if in jest 
1	to every word
1	of every bird
1	i listen d or replied as it behove 
1	scream d chaffinch sweet sweet sweet 
1	pretty lovey come and meet me here 
1	thy darling prove no better than a cheat 
1	and never come or fly when wintry days appear 
1	yet from a twig 
1	with voice so big 
1	the little fowl his utterance did repeat 
1	then i the man forlorn
1	hears earth send up a foolish noise aloft 
1	 and what ll he do what ll he do scoff d
1	the blackbird standing in ancient thorn 
1	then spread his sooty wings and flitted to the croft
1	with cackling laugh 
1	whom i being half
1	enraged called after giving back his scorn 
1	worse mock d the thrush die die 
1	o could he do it could he do it nay 
1	be quick be quick here here here went his lay 
1	 take heed take heed then why why why why why 
1	see ee now see ee now he drawl d back back 
1	o thrush be still 
1	or at thy will
1	seek some less sad interpreter than i 
1	 air air blue air and white 
1	whither i flee whither o whither o whither i flee 
1	 thus the lark hurried mounting from the lea 
1	 hills countries many waters glittering bright
1	whither i see whither i see deeper deeper deeper 
1	whither i see see see 
1	 gay lark i said 
1	 the song that s bred
1	in happy nest may well to heaven make flight 
1	 there s something something sad
1	i half remember piped a broken strain 
1	well sung sweet robin robin sung again 
1	 spring s opening cheerily cheerily be we glad 
1	which moved i wist not why me melancholy mad 
1	till now grown meek 
1	with wetted cheek 
1	most comforting and gentle thoughts i had 
1	long long ago beyond the misty space
1	of twice a thousand years 
1	in erin old there dwelt a mighty race
1	taller than roman spears 
1	like oaks and towers they had a giant grace 
1	were fleet as deers 
1	with winds and waves they made their biding place 
1	the western shepherd seers 
1	their ocean god was mananan mac lir 
1	whose angry lips
1	in their white foam full often would inter
1	whole fleets of ships 
1	 crom was their day god and their thunderer
1	made morning and eclipse 
1	 bride was their queen of song and unto her
1	they pray d with fire touch d lips 
1	great were their acts their passions and their sports 
1	with clay and stone
1	they piled on strath and shore those mystic forts 
1	not yet undone 
1	on cairn crown d hills they held their council courts 
1	while youths alone 
1	with giant dogs explored the elks resorts 
1	and brought them down 
1	of these was finn the father of the bard
1	whose ancient song
1	over the clamour of all change is heard 
1	sweet voiced and strong 
1	finn once o ertook granu the golden hair d 
1	the fleet and young 
1	from her the lovely and from him the feared 
1	the primal poet sprung 
1	 ossian two thousand years of mist and change
1	surround thy name 
1	thy finnian heroes now no longer range
1	the hills of fame 
1	the very name of finn and gael sound strange 
1	yet thine the same
1	by miscall d lake and desecrated grange
1	remains and shall remain 
1	the druid s altar and the druid s creed
1	we scarce can trace 
1	there is not left an undisputed deed
1	of all your race 
1	save your majestic song which hath their speed 
1	and strength and grace 
1	in that sole song they live and love and bleed 
1	it bears them on through space 
1	inspired giant shall we e er behold 
1	in our own time 
1	one fit to speak your spirit on the wold 
1	or seize your rhyme 
1	one pupil of the past as mighty soul d
1	as in the prime
1	were the fond fair and beautiful and bold 
1	they of your song sublime

1	 thomas d arcy mcgee 
1	he stepped a man out on the ways of men 
1	and no one knew his sept or rank or name 
1	like a strong stream far issuing from a glen 
1	from some source unexplored the master came 
1	gossips there were who wondrous keen of ken 
1	surmised that he must be a child of shame 
1	others declared him of the druids then 
1	thro patrick s labours fallen from power and fame 
1	he lived apart wrapt up in many plans 
1	he wooed not women tasted not of wine 
1	he shunned the sports and councils of the clans 
1	nor ever knelt at a frequented shrine 
1	his orisons were old poetic ranns
1	which the new olamhs deem d an evil sign 
1	to most he seemed one of those pagan khans
1	whose mystic vigour knows no cold decline 
1	he was the builder of the wondrous towers 
1	which tall and straight and exquisitely round 
1	rise monumental round this isle of ours 
1	index like marking spots of holy ground 
1	in glooming silent glens in lowland bowers 
1	on river banks these cloichteachs old abound 
1	where art enraptured meditates long hours
1	and science ponders wondering and spell bound 
1	lo wheresoe er these pillar towers aspire 
1	heroes and holy men repose below 
1	the bones of some gleaned from a pagan pyre 
1	others in armour lie as for a foe 
1	it was the mighty master s life desire
1	to chronicle his great ancestors so 
1	what holier duty what achievement higher
1	remains to us than this he thus doth show 
1	yet he the builder died an unknown death 
1	his labours done no man beheld him more 
1	 twas thought his body faded like a breath 
1	or like a sea mist floated off life s shore 
1	doubt overhangs his fate and faith and birth 
1	his works alone attest his life and love 
1	they are the only witnesses he hath 
1	men called him gobban saor and many a tale
1	yet lingers in the byways of the land 
1	of how he cleft the rock and down the vale
1	led the bright river child like in his hand 
1	of how on giant ships he spread great sail
1	and many marvels else by him first planned 
1	and tho these legends fail in innisfail
1	his name and towers for centuries still shall stand 
1	 thomas d arcy mcgee 
1	my name is patrick sheehan 
1	my years are thirty four 
1	tipperary is my native place 
1	not far from galtymore 
1	i came of honest parents 
1	but now they re lying low 
1	and many a pleasant day i spent
1	my father died i closed his eyes
1	 outside our cabin door 
1	the landlord and the sheriff too
1	were there the day before 
1	and then my loving mother 
1	and sisters three also 
1	were forced to go with broken hearts
1	for three long months in search of work 
1	i wandered far and near 
1	i went then to the poor house 
1	for to see my mother dear 
1	the news i heard nigh broke my heart 
1	but still in all my woe 
1	i blessed the friends who made their graves
1	bereft of home and kith and kin 
1	with plenty all around 
1	i starved within my cabin 
1	and slept upon the ground 
1	but cruel as my lot was 
1	i ne er did hardship know
1	 till i joined the english army 
1	far away from aherlow 
1	 rouse up there says the corporal 
1	 you lazy hirish hound 
1	why don t you hear you sleepy dog 
1	the call to arms sound 
1	alas i had been dreaming
1	of days long long ago 
1	i woke before sebastopol 
1	i groped to find my musket 
1	how dark i thought the night 
1	o blessed god it was not dark 
1	it was the broad daylight 
1	and when i found that i was blind 
1	my tears began to flow 
1	i longed for even a pauper s grave
1	o blessed virgin mary 
1	mine is a mournful tale 
1	a poor blind prisoner here i am 
1	in dublin s dreary gaol 
1	struck blind within the trenches 
1	where i never feared the foe 
1	and now i ll never see again
1	my own sweet aherlow 
1	a poor neglected mendicant 
1	i wandered through the street 
1	my nine months pension now being out 
1	i beg from all i meet 
1	as i joined my country s tyrants 
1	my face i ll never show
1	among the kind old neighbours
1	then irish youths dear countrymen 
1	take heed of what i say 
1	for if you join the english ranks 
1	you ll surely rue the day 
1	and whenever you are tempted
1	a soldiering to go 
1	remember poor blind sheehan
1	she lived beside the anner 
1	at the foot of sliev na mon 
1	a gentle peasant girl 
1	with mild eyes like the dawn 
1	her lips were dewy rosebuds 
1	her teeth of pearls rare 
1	and a snow drift neath a beechen bough
1	her neck and nut brown hair 
1	how pleasant twas to meet her
1	on sunday when the bell
1	was filling with its mellow tones
1	lone wood and grassy dell 
1	and when at eve young maidens
1	strayed the river bank along 
1	the widow s brown haired daughter
1	was loveliest of the throng 
1	o brave brave irish girls 
1	we well may call you brave 
1	sure the least of all your perils
1	is the stormy ocean wave 
1	when you leave our quiet valleys 
1	and cross the atlantic s foam 
1	to hoard your hard won earnings
1	for the helpless ones at home 
1	 write word to my own dear mother 
1	say we ll meet with god above 
1	and tell my little brothers
1	i send them all my love 
1	may the angels ever guard them 
1	is their dying sister s prayer 
1	and folded in the letter
1	was a braid of nut brown hair 
1	ah cold and well nigh callous 
1	this weary heart has grown
1	for thy helpless fate dear ireland 
1	and for sorrows of my own 
1	yet a tear my eye will moisten
1	when by anner s side i stray 
1	for the lily of the mountain foot
1	that withered far away 
1	i sit beside my darling s grave 
1	who in the prison died 
1	and tho my tears fall thick and fast 
1	i think of him with pride 
1	ay softly fall my tears like dew 
1	for one to god and ireland true 
1	 i love my god o er all he said 
1	 and then i love my land 
1	and next i love my lily sweet 
1	who pledged me her white hand 
1	to each to all i m ever true 
1	to god to ireland and to you 
1	no tender nurse his hard bed smoothed
1	or softly raised his head 
1	he fell asleep and woke in heaven
1	ere i knew he was dead 
1	yet why should i my darling rue 
1	he was to god and ireland true 
1	o tis a glorious memory 
1	i m prouder than a queen
1	to sit beside my hero s grave
1	and think on what has been 
1	and o my darling i am true
1	to god to ireland and to you 
1	green in the wizard arms 
1	of the foam bearded atlantic 
1	an isle of old enchantment 
1	a melancholy isle 
1	enchanted and dreaming lies 
1	and there by shannon s flowing 
1	in the moonlight spectre thin 
1	the spectre erin sits 
1	an aged desolation
1	she sits by old shannon s flowing 
1	a mother of many children 
1	of children exiled and dead 
1	in her home with bent head homeless 
1	clasping her knees she sits 
1	keening keening 
1	and at her keene the fairy grass
1	trembles on dun and barrow 
1	around the foot of her ancient crosses
1	the grave grass shakes and the nettle swings 
1	in haunted glens the meadow sweet
1	flings to the night wind
1	her mystic mournful perfume 
1	the sad spearmint by holy wells
1	breathes melancholy balm 
1	sometimes she lifts her head 
1	with blue eyes tearless 
1	and gazes athwart the reek of night
1	upon things long past 
1	upon things to come 
1	and sometimes when the moon
1	brings tempest upon the deep 
1	and roused atlantic thunders from his caverns in the west 
1	the wolf hound at her feet
1	springs up with a mighty bay 
1	and chords of mystery sound from the wild harp at her side 
1	strung from the heart of poets 
1	and she flies on the verge of the tempest
1	around her shuddering isle 
1	with grey hair streaming 
1	a meteor of evil omen 
1	the spectre of hope forlorn 
1	keening keening 
1	she keenes and the strings of her wild harp shiver
1	on the gusts of night 
1	o er the four waters she keenes over moyle she keenes 
1	o er the sea of milith and the strait of strongbow 
1	chanting her song of destiny 
1	the rune of the weaving fates 
1	and the nations hear in the void and quaking time of night 
1	sad unto dawning dirges 
1	solemn dirges 
1	and snatches of bardic song 
1	their souls quake in the void and quaking time of night 
1	and they dream of the weird of kings 
1	and tyrannies moulting sick
1	in the dreadful wind of change 
1	wail no more lonely one mother of exiles wail no more 
1	banshee of the world no more 
1	thy sorrows are the world s thou art no more alone 
1	thy wrongs the world s 
1	there s a glade in aghadoe aghadoe aghadoe 
1	there s a green and silent glade in aghadoe 
1	where we met my love and i love s fair planet in the sky 
1	o er that sweet and silent glade in aghadoe 
1	there s a glen in aghadoe aghadoe aghadoe 
1	there s a deep and secret glen in aghadoe 
1	where i hid from the eyes of the red coats and their spies
1	that year the trouble came to aghadoe 
1	o my curse on one black heart in aghadoe aghadoe 
1	on shaun dhuv my mother s son in aghadoe 
1	when your throat fries in hell s drouth salt the flame
1	be in your mouth 
1	for the treachery you did in aghadoe 
1	for they tracked me to that glen in aghadoe aghadoe 
1	when the price was on his head in aghadoe 
1	o er the mountain through the wood as i stole to him with food 
1	when in hiding lone he lay in aghadoe 
1	but they never took him living in aghadoe aghadoe 
1	with the bullets in his heart in aghadoe 
1	there he lay the head my breast keeps the warmth where
1	once twould rest 
1	gone to win the traitor s gold from aghadoe 
1	i walked to mallow town from aghadoe aghadoe 
1	brought his head from the gaol s gate to aghadoe 
1	then i covered him with fern and i piled on him the cairn 
1	like an irish king he sleeps in aghadoe 
1	o to creep into that cairn in aghadoe aghadoe 
1	there to rest upon his breast in aghadoe 
1	sure your dog for you could die with no truer heart than i 
1	your own love cold on your cairn in aghadoe 
1	i hear the wind a blowing 
1	i hear the corn a growing 
1	i hear the virgin praying 
1	i hear what she is saying 
1	girls when i am gone away 
1	on this bosom strew
1	only flowers meek and pale 
1	and the yew 
1	lay these hands down by my side 
1	let my face be bare 
1	bind a kerchief round the face 
1	smooth my hair 
1	let my bier be borne at dawn 
1	summer grows so sweet 
1	deep into the forest green
1	where boughs meet 
1	then pass away and let me lie
1	one long warm sweet day
1	there alone with face upturned 
1	one sweet day 
1	while the morning light grows broad 
1	while noon sleepeth sound 
1	while the evening falls and faints 
1	while the world goes round 
1	i made another garden yea 
1	i left the dead rose where it lay
1	and set the new above 
1	why did my summer not begin 
1	why did my heart not haste 
1	my old love came and walked therein
1	and laid the garden waste 
1	she entered with her weary smile 
1	just as of old 
1	she looked around a little while
1	and shivered with the cold 
1	her passing touch was death to all 
1	her passing look a blight 
1	she made the white rose petals fall 
1	and turned the red rose white 
1	her pale robe clinging to the grass
1	seemed like a snake
1	that bit the grass and ground alas 
1	and a sad trail did make 
1	she went up slowly to the gate 
1	and then just as of yore 
1	she turned back at the last to wait
1	and say farewell once more

1	the lily was ne er so pale 
1	stiller and stiller the river flows
1	along the path to the vale 
1	a little door is hid in the boughs

1	why should a maiden spin 
1	slower and slower turns the wheel 
1	the face turns red and pale

1	no living thing will grieve 
1	o were you on the mountain or saw you my love 
1	or saw you my own one my queen and my dove 
1	or saw you the maiden with the step firm and free 
1	and say is she pining in sorrow like me 
1	i was upon the mountain and saw there your love 
1	i saw there your own one your queen and your dove 
1	i saw there the maiden with the step firm and free
1	and she was not pining in sorrow like thee 
1	my grief on the sea 
1	how the waves of it roll 
1	for they heave between me
1	and the love of my soul 
1	abandoned forsaken 
1	to grief and to care 
1	will the sea ever waken
1	relief from despair 
1	my grief and my trouble
1	would he and i wear 
1	in the province of leinster 
1	were i and my darling 
1	o heart bitter wound 
1	on board of the ship
1	for america bound 
1	on a green bed of rushes
1	all last night i lay 
1	and i flung it abroad
1	with the heat of the day 
1	and my love came behind me 
1	he came from the south 
1	his breast to my bosom 
1	his mouth to my mouth 
1	she casts a spell o casts a spell 
1	which haunts me more than i can tell 
1	dearer because she makes me ill 
1	than who would will to make me well 
1	she is my store o she my store 
1	whose grey eye wounded me so sore 
1	who will not place in mine her palm 
1	who will not calm me any more 
1	she is my pet o she my pet 
1	whom i can never more forget 
1	who would not lose by me one moan 
1	nor stone upon my cairn set 
1	she is my roon o she my roon 
1	who tells me nothing leaves me soon 
1	who would not lose by me one sigh 
1	were death and i within one room 
1	she is my dear o she my dear 
1	who cares not whether i be here 
1	who would not weep when i am dead 
1	who makes me shed the silent tear 
1	hard my case o hard my case 
1	how have i lived so long a space 
1	she does not trust me any more 
1	but i adore her silent face 
1	she is my choice o she my choice 
1	who never made me to rejoice 
1	who caused my heart to ache so oft 
1	who put no softness in her voice 
1	great is my grief o great my grief 
1	neglected scorned beyond belief 
1	by her who looks at me askance 
1	by her who grants me no relief 
1	she s my desire o my desire 
1	more glorious than the bright sun s fire 
1	who more than wind blown ice more cold 
1	had i the boldness to sit by her 
1	she it is who stole my heart 
1	but left a void and aching smart 
1	but if she soften not her eye 
1	then life and i shall surely part 
1	for thee i shall not die 
1	woman high of fame and name 
1	foolish men thou mayest slay 
1	i and they are not the same 
1	why should i expire
1	for the fire of any eye 
1	slender waist or swan like limb 
1	is t for them that i should die 
1	the round breasts the fresh skin 
1	cheeks crimson hair so long and rich 
1	indeed indeed i shall not die 
1	please god not i for any such 
1	the golden hair the forehead thin 
1	the chaste mien the gracious ease 
1	the rounded heel the languid tone 
1	fools alone find death from these 
1	thy sharp wit thy perfect calm 
1	thy thin palm like foam of sea 
1	thy white neck thy blue eye 
1	i shall not die for thee 
1	woman graceful as the swan 
1	a wise man did nurture me 
1	little palm white neck bright eye 
1	i shall not die for ye 
1	a great great house it is 
1	a golden candlestick it is 
1	guess it rightly 
1	let it not go by thee 
1	there s a garden that i ken 
1	full of little gentlemen 
1	little caps of blue they wear 
1	and green ribbons very fair 
1	he comes to ye amidst the brine
1	the butterfly of the sun 
1	the man of the coat so blue and fine 
1	with red thread his shirt is done 
1	you see it come in on the shoulders of men 
1	like a thread of the silk it will leave us again 
1	a little lonely moorland lake 
1	its waters brown and cool and deep 
1	the cliff the hills behind it make
1	a picture for my heart to keep 
1	for rock and heather wave and strand 
1	wore tints i never saw them wear 
1	the june sunshine was o er the land 
1	before twas never half so fair 
1	the amber ripples sang all day 
1	and singing spilled their crowns of white
1	upon the beach in thin pale spray
1	that streaked the sober sand with light 
1	the amber ripples sang their song 
1	when suddenly from far o erhead
1	a lark s pure voice mixed with the throng
1	of lovely things about us spread 
1	some flowers were there so near the brink
1	their shadows in the waves were thrown 
1	while mosses green and gray and pink 
1	grew thickly round each smooth dark stone 
1	and over all the summer sky 
1	shut out the town we left behind 
1	 twas joy to stand in silence by 
1	one bright chain linking mind to mind 
1	o little lonely mountain spot 
1	your place within my heart will be
1	apart from all life s busy lot
1	a true sweet solemn memory 
1	out upon the sand dunes thrive the coarse long grasses 
1	herons standing knee deep in the brackish pool 
1	overhead the sunset fire and flame amasses 
1	and the moon to eastward rises pale and cool 
1	rose and green around her silver grey and pearly 
1	chequered with the black rooks flying home to bed 
1	for to wake at daybreak birds must couch them early 
1	and the day s a long one since the dawn was red 
1	on the chilly lakelet in that pleasant gloaming 
1	see the sad swans sailing they shall have no rest 
1	never a voice to greet them save the bittern s booming
1	where the ghostly sallows sway against the west 
1	 sister saith the grey swan sister i am weary 
1	turning to the white swan wet despairing eyes 
1	 o she saith my young one o she saith my dearie 
1	casts her wings about him with a storm of cries 
1	woe for lir s sweet children whom their vile step mother
1	glamoured with her witch spells for a thousand years 
1	died their father raving on his throne another 
1	blind before the end came from his burning tears 
1	she the fiends possess her torture her for ever 
1	gone is all the glory of the race of lir 
1	gone and long forgotten like a dream of fever 
1	but the swans remember all the days that were 
1	hugh the black and white swan with the beauteous feathers 
1	fiachra the black swan with the emerald breast 
1	conn the youngest dearest sheltered in all weathers 
1	him his snow white sister loves the tenderest 
1	these her mother gave her as she lay a dying 
1	to her faithful keeping faithful hath she been 
1	with her wings spread o er them when the tempest s crying 
1	and her songs so hopeful when the sky s serene 
1	other swans have nests made mid the reeds and rushes 
1	lined with downy feathers where the cygnets sleep
1	dreaming if a bird dreams till the daylight blushes 
1	then they sail out swiftly on the current deep 
1	with the proud swan father tall and strong and stately 
1	and the mild swan mother grave with household cares 
1	all well born and comely all rejoicing greatly 
1	full of honest pleasure is a life like theirs 
1	but alas for my swans with the human nature 
1	sick with human longings starved with human ties 
1	with their hearts all human cramped in a bird s stature 
1	and the human weeping in the bird s soft eyes 
1	never shall my swans build nests in some green river 
1	never fly to southward in the autumn grey 
1	rear no tender children love no mates for ever 
1	robbed alike of bird s joys and of man s are they 
1	babbled conn the youngest sister i remember
1	at my father s palace how i went in silk 
1	ate the juicy deer flesh roasted from the ember 
1	drank from golden goblets my child s draught of milk 
1	once i rode a hunting laughed to see the hurly 
1	shouted at the ball play on the lake did row 
1	you had for your beauty gauds that shone so rarely 
1	 peace saith finnuola that was long ago 
1	 sister saith fiachra well do i remember
1	how the flaming torches lit the banquet hall 
1	and the fire leaped skyward in the mid december 
1	and amid the rushes slept our staghounds tall 
1	by our father s right hand you sat shyly gazing 
1	smiling half and sighing with your eyes aglow 
1	as the bards sang loudly all your beauty praising 
1	 peace saith finnuola that was long ago 
1	 sister then saith hugh most do i remember
1	one i called my brother you earth s goodliest man 
1	strong as forest oaks are where the wild vines clamber 
1	first at feast or hunting in the battle s van 
1	angus you were handsome wise and true and tender 
1	loved by every comrade feared by every foe 
1	low low lies your beauty all forgot your splendour 
1	 peace saith finnuola that was long ago 
1	dews are in the clear air and the roselight paling 
1	over sands and sedges shines the evening star 
1	and the moon s disk high in heaven is sailing 
1	silvered all the spear heads of the rushes are 
1	housed warm are all things as the night grows colder 
1	water fowl and sky fowl dreamless in the nest 
1	but the swans go drifting drooping wings and shoulder 
1	cleaving the still waters where the fishes rest 
1	little sisters the birds 
1	we must praise god you and i 
1	you with songs that fill the sky 
1	i with halting words 
1	all things tell his praise 
1	woods and waters thereof sing 
1	summer winter autumn spring 
1	and the nights and days 
1	yea and cold and heat 
1	and the sun and stars and moon 
1	sea with her monotonous tune 
1	rain and hail and sleet 
1	and the winds of heaven 
1	and the solemn hills of blue 
1	and the brown earth and the dew 
1	and the thunder even 
1	and the flowers sweet breath 
1	all things make one glorious voice 
1	life with fleeting pains and joys
1	and our brother death 
1	little flowers of air 
1	with your feathers soft and sleek
1	and your bright brown eyes and meek 
1	he hath made you fair 
1	he hath taught to you
1	skill to weave on tree and thatch
1	nests where happy mothers hatch
1	speckled eggs of blue 
1	and hath children given 
1	when the soft heads overbrim
1	the brown nests then thank ye him
1	in the clouds of heaven 
1	also in your lives 
1	live his laws who loveth you 
1	husbands be ye kind and true 
1	be homekeeping wives 
1	love not gossiping 
1	stay at home and keep the nest 
1	fly not here and there in quest
1	of the newest thing 
1	live as brethren live 
1	love be in each heart and mouth 
1	be not envious be not wroth 
1	be not slow to give 
1	when ye build the nest
1	quarrel not o er straw or wool 
1	he who hath be bountiful
1	to the neediest 
1	be not puffed or vain
1	of your beauty or your worth 
1	of your children or your birth 
1	or the praise you gain 
1	eat not greedily 
1	sometimes for sweet mercy s sake 
1	worm or insect spare to take 
1	let it crawl or fly 
1	see ye sing not near
1	to our church on holy day 
1	lest the human folk should stray
1	from their prayer to hear 
1	now depart in peace 
1	in god s name i bless each one 
1	may your days be long i the sun
1	and your joys increase 
1	and remember me 
1	your poor brother francis who
1	loveth you and thanketh you
1	for this courtesy 
1	sometimes when ye sing 
1	name my name that he may take
1	pity for the dear song s sake
1	on my shortcoming 
1	all in the april morning 
1	april airs were abroad 
1	the sheep with their little lambs
1	passed me by on the road 
1	the sheep with their little lambs
1	passed me by on the road 
1	all in the april evening 
1	i thought on the lamb of god 
1	the lambs were weary and crying
1	with a weak human cry 
1	i thought on the lamb of god
1	going meekly to die 
1	up in the blue blue mountains
1	dewy pastures are sweet 
1	rest for the little bodies 
1	rest for the little feet 
1	up on the hill top green 
1	only a cross of shame
1	two stark crosses between 
1	all in the april evening 
1	april airs were abroad 
1	i saw the sheep with their lambs 
1	and thought on the lamb of god 
1	here in the garden bed 
1	hoeing the celery 
1	wonders the lord has made
1	pass ever before me 
1	i saw the young birds build 
1	and swallows come and go 
1	and summer grow and gild 
1	and winter die in snow 
1	many a thing i note 
1	and store it in my mind 
1	for all my ragged coat 
1	that scarce will stop the wind 
1	i light my pipe and draw 
1	i marvel with much awe
1	o er all the lord hath made 
1	now here s a curious thing 
1	upon the first of march 
1	the crow goes house building 
1	in the elms and in the larch 
1	and be it shine or snow 
1	though many winds carouse 
1	that day the artful crow
1	begins to build his house 
1	but then the wonder s big 
1	 if sunday fall that day 
1	 nor straw nor scraw nor twig 
1	till monday will he lay 
1	his black wings to his side 
1	he ll drone upon his perch 
1	subdued and holy eyed 
1	as though he were at church 
1	the crow s a gentleman
1	not greatly to my mind 
1	he ll steal what seeds he can 
1	and all you hide he ll find 
1	yet though he s bully and sneak 
1	to small birds bird of prey 
1	he counts the days of the week 
1	and keeps the sabbath day 
1	rose o the world she came to my bed
1	and changed the dreams of my heart and head 
1	for joy of mine she left grief of hers
1	and garlanded me with a crown of furze 
1	rose o the world they go out and in 
1	and watch me dream and my mother spin 
1	and they pity the tears on my sleeping face
1	while my soul s away in a fairy place 
1	rose o the world they have words galore 
1	and wide s the swing of my mother s door 
1	but soft they speak of my darkened eyes 
1	but what do they know who are all so wise 
1	rose o the world the pain you give
1	is worth all days that a man may live 
1	worth all shy prayers that the colleens say
1	on the night that darkens the wedding day 
1	rose o the world what man would wed
1	when he might dream of your face instead 
1	might go to his grave with the blessed pain
1	of hungering after your face again 
1	rose o the world they may talk their fill 
1	for dreams are good and my life stands still
1	while their lives red ashes the gossips stir 
1	but my fiddle knows and i talk to her 
1	 tis i go fiddling fiddling 
1	by weedy ways forlorn 
1	i make the blackbird s music
1	ere in his breast tis born 
1	the sleeping larks i waken
1	twixt the midnight and the morn 
1	no man alive has seen me 
1	but women hear me play
1	sometimes at door or window 
1	fiddling the souls away 
1	the child s soul and the colleen s
1	out of the covering clay 
1	none of my fairy kinsmen
1	make music with me now 
1	alone the raths i wander
1	or ride the whitethorn bough 
1	but the wild swans they know me 
1	and the horse that draws the plough 
1	i said my pleasure shall not move 
1	it is not fixed in things apart 
1	seeking not love but yet to love 
1	i put my trust in mine own heart 
1	i knew the fountain of the deep
1	wells up with living joy unfed 
1	such joys the lonely heart may keep 
1	and love grow rich with love unwed 
1	still flows the ancient fount sublime 
1	but ah for my heart shed tears shed tears 
1	not it but love has scorn of time 
1	it turns to dust beneath the years 
1	we must pass like smoke or live within the spirit s fire 
1	for we can no more than smoke unto the flame return
1	if our thought has changed to dream our will unto desire 
1	as smoke we vanish though the fire may burn 
1	lights of infinite pity star the grey dusk of our days 
1	surely here is soul with it we have eternal breath 
1	in the fire of love we live or pass by many ways 
1	by unnumbered ways of dream to death 
1	its edges foamed with amethyst and rose 
1	withers once more the old blue flower of day 
1	there where the ether like a diamond glows
1	its petals fade away 
1	a shadowy tumult stirs the dusky air 
1	sparkle the delicate dews the distant snows 
1	the great deep thrills for through it everywhere
1	the breath of beauty blows 
1	i saw how all the trembling ages past 
1	moulded to her by deep and deeper breath 
1	neared to the hour when beauty breathes her last
1	and knows herself in death 
1	what of all the will to do 
1	it has vanished long ago 
1	for a dream shaft pierced it through
1	from the unknown archer s bow 
1	what of all the soul to think 
1	some one offered it a cup
1	filled with a diviner drink 
1	and the flame has burned it up 
1	what of all the hope to climb 
1	only in the self we grope
1	to the misty end of time 
1	truth has put an end to hope 
1	what of all the heart to love 
1	sadder than for will or soul 
1	no light lured it on above 
1	love has found itself the whole 
1	i did not deem it half so sweet
1	to feel thy gentle hand 
1	as in a dream thy soul to greet
1	across wide leagues of land 
1	untouched more near to draw to you
1	where amid radiant skies 
1	glimmered thy plumes of iris hue 
1	let me dream only with my heart 
1	love first and after see 
1	know thy diviner counterpart
1	before i kneel to thee 
1	so in thy motions all expressed
1	thy angel i may view 
1	i shall not in thy beauty rest 
1	but beauty s ray on you 
1	what is the love of shadowy lips
1	that know not what they seek or press 
1	from whom the lure for ever slips
1	and fails their phantom tenderness 
1	the mystery and light of eyes
1	that near to mine grow dim and cold 
1	they move afar in ancient skies
1	mid flame and mystic darkness rolled 
1	o beauty as thy heart o erflows
1	in tender yielding unto me 
1	a vast desire awakes and grows
1	unto forgetfulness of thee 
1	image of beauty when i gaze on thee 
1	trembling i waken to a mystery 
1	how through one door we go to life or death
1	by spirit kindled or the sensual breath 
1	image of beauty when my way i go 
1	no single joy or sorrow do i know 
1	elate for freedom leaps the starry power 
1	the life which passes mourns its wasted hour 
1	and ah to think how thin the veil that lies
1	between the pain of hell and paradise 
1	where the cool grass my aching head embowers
1	god sings the lovely carol of the flowers 
1	a cabin on the mountain side hid in a grassy nook 
1	with door and windows open wide where friendly stars may look 
1	the rabbit shy can patter in the winds may enter free
1	who throng around the mountain throne in living ecstasy 
1	and when the sun sets dimmed in eve and purple fills the air 
1	i think the sacred hazel tree is dropping berries there
1	from starry fruitage waved aloft where connla s well o erflows 
1	for sure the immortal waters run through every wind that blows 
1	i think when night towers up aloft and shakes the trembling dew 
1	how every high and lonely thought that thrills my spirit through
1	is but a shining berry dropped down through the purple air 
1	and from the magic tree of life the fruit falls everywhere 
1	no temple crowned the shaggy capes 
1	no safety soothed the kind 
1	the clouds unfabled shifted shapes 
1	and nameless roamed the wind 
1	the stars the circling heights of heaven 
1	the mountains bright with snows
1	looked down and sadly man at even
1	lay down and sad he rose 
1	till ages brought the hour again 
1	when fell a windless morn 
1	and child of agonistic pain
1	and bliss the word was born 
1	which grew from all it gazed upon 
1	and spread thro soil and sphere 
1	and shrunk the whole into the one 
1	and fetched the farthest here 
1	high is the summer s night but deep
1	the hidden mind unfolds 
1	within it does an image sleep
1	of all that it beholds 
1	alas when man with busy brow 
1	his conquering names hath set
1	to planet plant and worm who now
1	will teach us to forget 
1	what poet now when wisdoms fail 
1	another theme shall dare 
1	the nameless and remove the veil
1	which hides it everywhere 
1	what is that beyond thy life 
1	and beyond all life around 
1	which when thy quick brain is still 
1	nods to thee from the stars 
1	lo it says thou hast found
1	me the lonely lonely one 
1	think the ragged turf boy urges
1	o er the dusty road his asses 
1	think on sea shore far the lonely
1	heron wings along the sand 
1	think in woodland under oak boughs
1	now the streaming sunbeam passes 
1	and bethink thee thou art servant
1	to the same all moving hand 
1	ah see the fair chivalry come the companions of christ

1	that such a misfortune should give her such pain 
1	a kiss then i gave her and ere i did leave her 
1	she vowed for such pleasure she d break it again 
1	 twas haymaking season i can t tell the reason

1	 from an irish keen 
1	yes thou art gone my mary dear and morian shehone
1	is left to sing his song of woe and wail for thee alone 
1	o snow white were thy virtues the beautiful the young 
1	the old with pleasure bent to hear the music of thy tongue 
1	the young with rapture gazed on thee and their hearts in
1	love were bound 
1	for thou wast brighter than the sun that sheds its light around 
1	my soul is dark o mary dear thy sun of beauty s set 
1	and i am left to pour my woe above thy grave alone 
1	for dear wert thou to the fond heart of morian shehone 
1	fast flowing tears above the grave of the rich man are shed 
1	but they are dried when the cold stone shuts in his narrow bed 
1	not so with my heart s faithful love the dark grave cannot hide
1	from morian s eyes thy form of grace of loveliness and pride 
1	thou didst not fall like the sere leaf when autumn s chill
1	winds blow 
1	 twas a tempest and a storm blast that has laid my mary low 
1	hadst thou not friends that loved thee well hadst thou not
1	garments rare 
1	wast thou not happy mary wast thou not young and fair 
1	o am i left to pour my woes above thy grave alone 
1	thou idol of the faithful heart of morian shehone 
1	sweet were thy looks and sweet thy smiles and kind wast thou
1	to all 
1	the withering scowl of envy on thy fortunes dared not fall 
1	for thee thy friends lament and mourn and never cease to weep 
1	o that their lamentations could awake thee from thy sleep 
1	o that thy peerless form again could meet my loving clasp 
1	o that the cold damp hand of death could loose his iron grasp 
1	yet when the valley s daughters meet beneath the tall elm tree 
1	and talk of mary as a dream that never more shall be 
1	then may thy spirit float around like music in the air 
1	and pour upon their virgin souls a blessing and a prayer 
1	o am i left to pour my wail above thy grave alone 
1	then sinks in silence the lament of morian shehone 
1	speak low speak low the banshee is crying 
1	hark hark to the echo she s dying she s dying

1	hush hush have you heard what the banshee said 
1	o list to the echo she s dead she s dead 
1	no shadow now dims the face of the water 
1	gone gone is the wraith of the geraldine s daughter 
1	the step of yon train is heavy and slow 
1	there s wringing of hands there s breathing of woe 
1	what melody rolls over mountain and water 
1	 tis the funeral chant of the geraldine s daughter 
1	the requiem sounds like the plaintive moan
1	which the wind makes over the sepulchre s stone 
1	 o why did she die our hearts blood had bought her 
1	o why did she die the geraldine s daughter 
1	the thistle beard floats the wild roses wave
1	with the blast that sweeps over the newly made grave 
1	the stars dimly twinkle and hoarse falls the water 
1	while night birds are wailing the geraldine s daughter 
1	by memory inspired 
1	and love of country fired 
1	the deeds of men i love to dwell upon 
1	and the patriotic glow
1	of my spirit must bestow

1	to old men playing at cards
1	with a twinkling of ancient hands 
1	the bread and the wine had a doom

1	and when white moths were on the wing 
1	and moth like stars were flickering out 
1	i dropped the berry in a stream
1	and caught a little silver trout 
1	when i had laid it on the floor
1	i went to blow the fire a flame 
1	but something rustled on the floor 
1	and someone called me by my name 
1	it had become a glimmering girl
1	with apple blossom in her hair
1	who called me by my name and ran
1	and faded through the brightening air 
1	though i am old with wandering
1	through hollow lands and hilly lands 
1	i will find out where she has gone 
1	and kiss her lips and take her hands 
1	and walk among long dappled grass 
1	and pluck till time and times are done 
1	the silver apples of the moon 
1	the golden apples of the sun 
1	i rise in the dawn and i kneel and blow
1	till the seed of the fire flicker and glow 
1	and then i must scrub and bake and sweep
1	till stars are beginning to blink and peep 
1	and the young lie long and dream in their bed
1	of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head 
1	and their day goes over in idleness 
1	and they sigh if the wind but lift a tress 
1	while i must work because i am old 
1	and the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold 
1	when i play on my fiddle in dooney 
1	folk dance like a wave of the sea 
1	my cousin is priest in kilvarnet 
1	my brother in moharabuiee 
1	i passed my brother and cousin 
1	the host is riding from knocknarea
1	they read in their books of prayer 
1	i read in my book of songs
1	i bought at the sligo fair 
1	when we come at the end of time 
1	to peter sitting in state 
1	he will smile on the three old spirits 
1	but call me first through the gate 
1	for the good are always the merry 
1	save by an evil chance 
1	and the merry love the fiddle
1	and the merry love to dance 
1	and when the folk there spy me 
1	they will all come up to me 
1	with here is the fiddler of dooney 
1	and dance like a wave of the sea 
1	o what to me the little room
1	that was brimmed up with prayer and rest 
1	he bade me out into the gloom 
1	and my breast lies upon his breast 
1	o what to me my mother s care 
1	the house where i was safe and warm 
1	the shadowy blossom of my hair
1	will hide us from the bitter storm 
1	o hiding hair and dewy eyes 
1	i am no more with life and death 
1	my heart upon his warm heart lies 
1	my breath is mixed into his breath 
1	pale brows still hands and dim hair 
1	i had a beautiful friend
1	and dreamed that the old despair
1	would end in love in the end 
1	she looked in my heart one day
1	and saw your image was there 
1	she has gone weeping away 
1	do you not hear me calling white deer with no horns 
1	i have been changed to a hound with one red ear 
1	i have been in the path of stones and the wood of thorns 
1	for somebody hid hatred and hope and desire and fear
1	under my feet that they follow you night and day 
1	a man with a hazel wand came without sound 
1	he changed me suddenly i was looking another way 
1	and now my calling is but the calling of a hound 
1	and time and birth and change are hurrying by 
1	i would that the boar without bristles had come from the west
1	and had rooted the sun and moon and stars out of the sky
1	and lay in the darkness grunting and turning to his rest 
1	i hear the shadowy horses their long manes a shake 
1	their hoofs heavy with tumult their eyes glimmering white 
1	the north unfolds above them clinging creeping night 
1	the east her hidden joy before the morning break 
1	the west weeps in pale dew and sighs passing away 
1	the south is pouring down roses of crimson fire 
1	o vanity of sleep hope dream endless desire 
1	the horses of disaster plunge in the heavy clay 
1	beloved let your eyes half close and your heart beat
1	over my heart and your hair fall over my breast 
1	drowning love s lonely hour in deep twilight of rest 
1	and hiding their tossing manes and their tumultuous feet 
1	o curlew cry no more in the air 
1	or only to the waters in the west 
1	because your crying brings to my mind
1	passion dimmed eyes and long heavy hair
1	that was shaken out over my breast 
1	there is enough evil in the crying of wind 
1	when my arms wrap you round i press
1	my heart upon the loveliness
1	that has long faded from the world 
1	in shadowy pools when armies fled 
1	the love tales wove with silken thread
1	by dreaming ladies upon cloth
1	that has made fat the murderous moth 
1	the roses that of old time were
1	woven by ladies in their hair 
1	the dew cold lilies ladies bore
1	through many a sacred corridor
1	where such gray clouds of incense rose
1	that only the gods eyes did not close 
1	for that pale breast and lingering hand
1	come from a more dream heavy land 
1	a more dream heavy hour than this 
1	and when you sigh from kiss to kiss
1	i hear white beauty sighing too 
1	for hours when all must fade like dew
1	but flame on flame deep under deep 
1	throne over throne where in half sleep
1	their swords upon their iron knees
1	brood her high lonely mysteries 
1	i bring you with reverent hands
1	the books of my numberless dreams 
1	white woman that passion has worn
1	as the tide wears the dove gray sands 
1	and with heart more old than the horn
1	that is brimmed from the pale fire of time 
1	white woman with numberless dreams
1	i bring you my passionate rhyme 
1	fasten your hair with a golden pin 
1	and bind up every wandering tress 
1	i bade my heart build these poor rhymes 
1	it worked at them day out day in 
1	building a sorrowful loveliness
1	out of the battles of old times 
1	you need but lift a pearl pale hand 
1	and bind up your long hair and sigh 
1	and all men s hearts must burn and beat 
1	and candle like foam on the dim sand 
1	and stars climbing the dew dropping sky 
1	live but to light your passing feet 
1	be you still be you still trembling heart 
1	remember the wisdom out of the old days 
1	 him who trembles before the flame and the flood 
1	and the winds that blow through the starry ways 
1	let the starry winds and the flame and the flood
1	cover over and hide for he has no part
1	with the proud majestical multitude 
1	the jester walked in the garden 
1	the garden had fallen still 
1	he bade his soul rise upward
1	and stand on her window sill 
1	it rose in a straight blue garment 
1	when owls began to call 
1	it had grown wise tongued by thinking
1	of a quiet and light footfall 
1	but the young queen would not listen 
1	she rose in her pale night gown 
1	she drew in the heavy casement
1	and pushed the latches down 
1	he bade his heart go to her 
1	when the owls called out no more 
1	in a red and quivering garment
1	it sang to her through the door 
1	it had grown sweet tongued by dreaming 
1	of a flutter of flower like hair 
1	but she took up her fan from the table
1	and waved it off on the air 
1	 i have cap and bells he pondered 
1	 i will send them to her and die 
1	and when the morning whitened
1	he left them where she went by 
1	she laid them upon her bosom 
1	under a cloud of her hair 
1	and her red lips sang them a love song 
1	till stars grew out of the air 
1	she opened her door and her window 
1	and the heart and the soul came through 
1	to her right hand came the red one 
1	to her left hand came the blue 
1	they set up a noise like crickets 
1	a chattering wise and sweet 
1	and her hair was a folded flower
1	and the quiet of love in her feet 
1	the dews drop slowly and dreams gather unknown spears
1	suddenly hurtle before my dream awakened eyes 
1	and then the clash of fallen horsemen and the cries
1	of unknown perishing armies beat about my ears 
1	we who still labour by the cromlec on the shore 
1	the grey cairn on the hill when day sinks drowned in dew 
1	being weary of the world s empires bow down to you
1	master of the still stars and of the flaming door 
1	if this importunate heart trouble your peace
1	with words lighter than air 
1	or hopes that in mere hoping flicker and cease 
1	crumple the rose in your hair 
1	and cover your lips with odorous twilight and say 
1	 o hearts of wind blown flame 
1	 o winds elder than changing of night and day 
1	 that murmuring and longing came 
1	 from marble cities loud with tabors of old
1	 in dove gray faery lands 
1	 from battle banners fold upon purple fold 
1	 queens wrought with glimmering hands 
1	 that saw young niamh hover with love lorn face
1	 above the wandering tide 
1	 and lingered in the hidden desolate place 
1	 where the last phoenix died
1	 and wrapped the flames above his holy head 
1	 and still murmur and long 
1	 o piteous hearts changing till change be dead
1	 in a tumultuous song 
1	and cover the pale blossoms of your breast
1	with your dim heavy hair 
1	and trouble with a sigh for all things longing for rest
1	the odorous twilight there 
1	i dreamed that i stood in a valley and amid sighs 
1	for happy lovers passed two by two where i stood 
1	and i dreamed my lost love came stealthily out of the wood
1	with her cloud pale eyelids falling on dream dimmed eyes 
1	i cried in my dream o women bid the young men lay
1	 their heads on your knees and drown their eyes with your hair 
1	 or remembering hers they will find no other face fair
1	 till all the valleys of the world have been withered away 
1	o cloud pale eyelids dream dimmed eyes
1	the poets labouring all their days
1	to build a perfect beauty in rhyme
1	are overthrown by a woman s gaze
1	and by the unlabouring brood of the skies 
1	and therefore my heart will bow when dew
1	is dropping sleep until god burn time 
1	before the unlabouring stars and you 
1	i wander by the edge
1	of this desolate lake
1	where wind cries in the sedge
1	 until the axle break
1	that keeps the stars in their round
1	and hands hurl in the deep
1	the banners of east and west
1	and the girdle of light is unbound 
1	your breast will not lie by the breast
1	of your beloved in sleep 
1	half close your eyelids loosen your hair 
1	and dream about the great and their pride 
1	they have spoken against you everywhere 
1	but weigh this song with the great and their pride 
1	i made it out of a mouthful of air 
1	their children s children shall say they have lied 
1	cumhal called out bending his head 
1	till dathi came and stood 
1	with a blink in his eyes at the cave mouth 
1	between the wind and the wood 
1	and cumhal said bending his knees 
1	 i have come by the windy way
1	 to gather the half of your blessedness
1	 and learn to pray when you pray 
1	 i can bring you salmon out of the streams
1	 and heron out of the skies 
1	but dathi folded his hands and smiled
1	with the secrets of god in his eyes 
1	and cumhal saw like a drifting smoke
1	all manner of blessed souls 
1	women and children young men with books 
1	and old men with croziers and stoles 
1	 praise god and god s mother dathi said 
1	 for god and god s mother have sent
1	 the blessedest souls that walk in the world
1	 to fill your heart with content 
1	 and which is the blessedest cumhal said 
1	 where all are comely and good 
1	 is it these that with golden thuribles
1	 are singing about the wood 
1	 my eyes are blinking dathi said 
1	 with the secrets of god half blind 
1	 but i can see where the wind goes
1	 and follow the way of the wind 
1	 and blessedness goes where the wind goes 
1	 and when it is gone we are dead 
1	 i see the blessedest soul in the world
1	 and he nods a drunken head 
1	 o blessedness comes in the night and the day
1	 and whither the wise heart knows 
1	 and one has seen in the redness of wine
1	 that drowsily drops faint leaves on him
1	 and the sweetness of desire 
1	 while time and the world are ebbing away
1	 in twilights of dew and of fire 
1	far off most secret and inviolate rose 
1	enfold me in my hour of hours where those
1	who sought thee in the holy sepulchre 
1	or in the wine vat dwell beyond the stir
1	and tumult of defeated dreams and deep
1	among pale eyelids heavy with the sleep
1	men have named beauty thy great leaves enfold
1	the ancient beards the helms of ruby and gold
1	of the crowned magi and the king whose eyes
1	saw the pierced hands and rood of elder rise
1	in druid vapour and make the torches dim 
1	till vain frenzy awoke and he died and him
1	who met fand walking among flaming dew
1	by a gray shore where the wind never blew 
1	and lost the world and emer for a kiss 
1	and him who drove the gods out of their liss 
1	and till a hundred morns had flowered red 
1	feasted and wept the barrows of his dead 
1	and the proud dreaming king who flung the crown
1	and sorrow away and calling bard and clown
1	dwelt among wine stained wanderers in deep woods 
1	and him who sold tillage and house and goods 
1	and sought through lands and islands numberless years 
1	until he found with laughter and with tears 
1	a woman of so shining loveliness 
1	that men threshed corn at midnight by a tress 
1	a little stolen tress i too await
1	the hour of thy great wind of love and hate 
1	when shall the stars be blown about the sky 
1	like the sparks blown out of a smithy and die 
1	surely thine hour has come thy great wind blows 
1	far off most secret and inviolate rose 
1	o where is our mother of peace
1	nodding her purple hood 
1	for the winds that awakened the stars
1	are blowing through my blood 
1	i would that the death pale deer
1	had come through the mountain side 
1	and trampled the mountain away 
1	and drunk up the murmuring tide 
1	for the winds that awakened the stars
1	are blowing through my blood 
1	and our mother of peace has forgot me
1	under her purple hood 
1	when the flaming lute thronged angelic door is wide 
1	when an immortal passion breathes in mortal clay 
1	our hearts endure the scourge the plaited thorns the way
1	crowded with bitter faces the wounds in palm and side 
1	the hyssop heavy sponge the flowers by kidron stream 
1	we will bend down and loosen our hair over you 
1	that it may drop faint perfume and be heavy with dew 
1	lilies of death pale hope roses of passionate dream 
1	though you are in your shining days 
1	voices among the crowd
1	and new friends busy with your praise 
1	be not unkind or proud 
1	but think about old friends the most 
1	time s bitter flood will rise 
1	your beauty perish and be lost
1	for all eyes but these eyes 
1	o colleens kneeling by your altar rails long hence 
1	when songs i wove for my beloved hide the prayer 
1	and smoke from this dead heart drifts through the violet air
1	and covers away the smoke of myrrh and frankincense 
1	bend down and pray for the great sin i wove in song 
1	till maurya of the wounded heart cry a sweet cry 
1	and call to my beloved and me no longer fly
1	 amid the hovering piteous penitential throng 
1	the powers whose name and shape no living creature knows
1	have pulled the immortal rose 
1	and though the seven lights bowed in their dance and wept 
1	the polar dragon slept 
1	his heavy rings uncoiled from glimmering deep to deep 
1	when will he wake from sleep 
1	great powers of falling wave and wind and windy fire 
1	with your harmonious choir
1	encircle her i love and sing her into peace 
1	that my old care may cease 
1	unfold your flaming wings and cover out of sight
1	the nets of day and night 
1	dim powers of drowsy thought let her no longer be
1	like the pale cup of the sea 
1	when winds have gathered and sun and moon burned dim
1	above its cloudy rim 
1	but let a gentle silence wrought with music flow
1	whither her footsteps go 
1	were you but lying cold and dead 
1	and lights were paling out of the west 
1	you would come hither and bend your head 
1	and i would lay my head on your breast 
1	and you would murmur tender words 
1	forgiving me because you were dead 
1	nor would you rise and hasten away 
1	though you have the will of the wild birds 
1	but know your hair was bound and wound
1	about the stars and moon and sun 
1	o would beloved that you lay
1	under the dock leaves in the ground 
1	while lights were paling one by one 
1	had i the heavens embroidered cloths 
1	enwrought with golden and silver light 
1	the blue and the dim and the dark cloths
1	of night and light and the half light 
1	i would spread the cloths under your feet 
1	but i being poor have only my dreams 
1	i have spread my dreams under your feet 
1	tread softly because you tread on my dreams 
1	i have drunk ale from the country of the young
1	and weep because i know all things now 
1	i have been a hazel tree and they hung
1	among my leaves in times out of mind 
1	i became a rush that horses tread 
1	i became a man a hater of the wind 
1	knowing one out of all things alone that his head
1	would not lie on the breast or his lips on the hair
1	of the woman that he loves until he dies 
1	although the rushes and the fowl of the air
1	cry of his love with their pitiful cries 
1	a woman near gort in galway says there is a boy now of the
1	 o beautiful woman come with me to the marvellous land where one
1	i use the wind as a symbol of vague desires and hopes not merely
1	my deer and hound are properly related to the deer and hound that
1	somewhere 
1	 i am but an empty shade 
1	far from life and passion laid 
1	yet does sweet remembrance thrill
1	all my shadowy being still 
1	presently because of his great love he gave up his throne to
1	i have founded him who sold tillage and house and goods upon
1	and over the grave of clooth na bare 
1	caolte tossing his burning hair
1	and niamh calling away come away 
1	empty your heart of its mortal dream 
1	the winds awaken the leaves whirl round 
1	our cheeks are pale our hair is unbound 
1	our breasts are heaving our eyes are a gleam 
1	our arms are waving our lips are apart 
1	and if any gaze on our rushing band 
1	we come between him and the deed of his hand 
1	and might have known at last unhaunted sleep

1	badgers and hedgehogs seem to have died of drought

1	i sat among the beggars at the cross roads

1	what did you beg 
1	i had no chance to beg

1	it may be that we are that trouble for we 
1	although we ve wandered in the wood this hour 
1	have lost it too yet i should know my way

1	your servants take when they are marketing 
1	but first sit down and rest yourself awhile

1	shemus muttering 
1	what music music 
1	ah do not blame the finger on the string 
1	the doctors bid me fly the unlucky times
1	and find distraction for my thoughts or else
1	pine to my grave 
1	i have said nothing lady 
1	why should the like of us complain 
1	have done 
1	sorrows that she s but read of in a book
1	weigh on her mind as if they had been her own 
1	aleel singing 
1	i know who d measure out his length 
1	i know the heads that i should break 
1	there all s out now to leave or take 
1	and who mocks music mocks at love 
1	i ll not go far to choose 
1	 snapping his fingers in shemus face 
1	i know the heads that i shall break 
1	 he takes a step towards the door and then turns again 
1	shut to the door before the night has fallen 
1	for who can say what walks or in what shape
1	some devilish creature flies in the air but now
1	two grey horned owls hooted above our heads 
1	so that fool s gone 
1	he s seen the horned owls too 
1	there s no good luck in owls but it may be
1	that the ill luck s to fall upon his head 
1	you never thanked her ladyship 
1	thank her 
1	for seven halfpence and a silver bit 
1	but for this empty purse 
1	what s that for thanks 
1	or what s the double of it that she promised 
1	with bread and flesh and every sort of food
1	up to a price no man has heard the like of
1	and rising every day 
1	we have all she had 
1	she emptied out the purse before our eyes 
1	shemus to mary who has gone to close the door 
1	leave that door open 
1	when those that have read books 
1	and seen the seven wonders of the world 
1	fear what s above or what s below the ground 
1	it s time that poverty should bolt the door 
1	i ll have no bolts for there is not a thing
1	that walks above the ground or under it
1	i had not rather welcome to this house
1	than any more of mankind rich or poor 
1	so that they brought us money 
1	i heard say
1	there s something that appears like a white bird 
1	a pigeon or a seagull or the like 
1	but if you hit it with a stone or a stick
1	it clangs as though it had been made of brass 
1	and that if you dig down where it was scratching
1	you ll find a crock of gold 
1	but dream of gold
1	for three nights running and there s always gold 
1	you might be starved before you ve dug it out 
1	but maybe if you called something would come 
1	they have been seen of late 
1	is it call devils 
1	call devils from the wood call them in here 
1	so you d stand up against me and you d say
1	who or what i am to welcome here he hits her 
1	that is to show who s master 
1	call them in 
1	god help us all 
1	pray if you have a mind to 
1	it s little that the sleepy ears above
1	care for your words but i ll call what i please 
1	there is many a one they say had money from them 
1	shemus at door 
1	whatever you are that walk the woods at night 
1	so be it that you have not shouldered up
1	out of a grave for i ll have nothing human 
1	and have free hands a friendly trick of speech 
1	i welcome you come sit beside the fire 
1	what matter if your head s below your arms
1	or you ve a horse s tail to whip your flank 
1	feathers instead of hair that s but a straw 
1	come share what bread and meat is in the house 
1	and stretch your heels and warm them in the ashes 
1	and after that let s share and share alike
1	and curse all men and women come in come in 
1	what is there no one there turning from door 
1	and yet they say
1	they are as common as the grass and ride
1	even upon the book in the priest s hand 
1	 teig lifts one arm slowly and points toward the door and begins
1	deliberately when they are seated they take money out of
1	embroidered purses at their girdles and begin arranging it on the
1	you speak to them 
1	 twas you that called them 
1	shemus coming nearer 
1	i d make so bold if you would pardon it 
1	to ask if there s a thing you d have of us 
1	although we are but poor people if there is 
1	we ve travelled a long road 
1	for we are merchants that must tramp the world 
1	and now we look for supper and a fire
1	and a safe corner to count money in 
1	i thought you were but that s no matter now 
1	there had been words between my wife and me
1	because i said i would be master here 
1	and ask in what i pleased or who i pleased
1	and so but that is nothing to the point 
1	because it s certain that you are but merchants 
1	we travel for the master of all merchants 
1	yet if you were that i had thought but now
1	i d welcome you no less be what you please
1	and you ll have supper at the market rate 
1	that means that what was sold for but a penny
1	is now worth fifty 
1	 merchants begin putting money on carpet 
1	our master bids us pay
1	so good a price that all who deal with us
1	shall eat drink and be merry 
1	bestir yourself 
1	go kill and draw the fowl while teig and i
1	lay out the plates and make a better fire 
1	i will not cook for you 
1	not cook not cook 
1	do not be angry she wants to pay me back
1	because i struck her in that argument 
1	but she ll get sense again since the dearth came
1	we rattle one on another as though we were
1	knives thrown into a basket to be cleaned 
1	i will not cook for you because i know
1	in what unlucky shape you sat but now
1	outside this door 
1	it s this your honours 
1	because of some wild words my father said
1	she thinks you are not of those who cast a shadow 
1	i said i d make the devils of the wood
1	welcome if they d a mind to eat and drink 
1	but it is certain that you are men like us 
1	it s strange that she should think we cast no shadow 
1	for there is nothing on the ridge of the world
1	that s more substantial than the merchants are
1	that buy and sell you 
1	if you are not demons 
1	and seeing what great wealth is spread out there 
1	give food or money to the starving poor 
1	if we knew how to find deserving poor
1	we d do our share 
1	but seek them patiently 
1	we know the evils of mere charity 
1	those scruples may befit a common time 
1	i had thought there was a pushing to and fro 
1	at times like this that overset the scale
1	and trampled measure down 
1	but if already
1	we d thought of a more prudent way than that 
1	if each one brings a bit of merchandise 
1	we ll give him such a price he never dreamt of 
1	where shall the starving come at merchandise 
1	we will ask nothing but what all men have 
1	their swine and cattle fields and implements
1	are sold and gone 
1	they have not sold all yet 
1	for there s a vaporous thing that may be nothing 
1	but that s the buyer s risk a second self 
1	they call immortal for a story s sake 
1	they come to buy our souls 
1	i ll barter mine 
1	why should we starve for what may be but nothing 
1	what can it be but nothing 
1	what has god poured out of his bag but famine 
1	satan gives money 
1	yet no thunder stirs 
1	there is a heap for each 
1	 shemus goes to take money 
1	but no not yet 
1	for there s a work i have to set you to 
1	so then you re as deceitful as the rest 
1	and all that talk of buying what s but a vapour
1	is fancy bread i might have known as much 
1	because that s how the trick o the loop man talks 
1	that s for the work each has its separate price 
1	but neither price is paid till the work s done 
1	the same for me 
1	oh god why are you still 
1	you ve but to cry aloud at every cross road 
1	at every house door that we buy men s souls 
1	and give so good a price that all may live
1	in mirth and comfort till the famine s done 
1	because we are christian men 
1	come let s away 
1	i shall keep running till i ve earned the price 
1	 who has risen and gone towards fire 
1	stop you must have proof behind the words 
1	so here s your entertainment on the road 
1	 he throws a bag of money on the ground 
1	live as you please our master s generous 
1	destroyers of souls god will destroy you quickly 
1	you shall at last dry like dry leaves and hang
1	nailed like dead vermin to the doors of god 
1	curse to your fill for saints will have their dreams 
1	though we re but vermin that our master sent
1	to overrun the world he at the end
1	shall pull apart the pale ribs of the moon
1	and quench the stars in the ancestral night 
1	god is all powerful 
1	pray you shall need him 
1	you shall eat dock and grass and dandelion 
1	till that low threshold there becomes a wall 
1	and when your hands can scarcely drag your body
1	we shall be near you 
1	our faces go unscratched 
1	wring the neck o that fowl scatter the flour
1	and look if there is bread upon the shelves 
1	we ll turn the fowl upon the spit and roast it 
1	and eat the supper we were bidden to 
1	now that the house is quiet praise our master 
1	and stretch and warm our heels among the ashes 
1	front scene a wood with perhaps distant view of turreted house
1	against a diapered or gold background 
1	cathleen stopping 
1	surely this leafy corner where one smells
1	the wild bee s honey has a story too 
1	there is the house at last 
1	a man they say 
1	loved maeve the queen of all the invisible host 
1	and died of his love nine centuries ago 
1	and now when the moon s riding at the full 
1	she leaves her dancers lonely and lies there
1	upon that level place and for three days
1	stretches and sighs and wets her long pale cheeks 
1	so she loves truly 
1	no but wets her cheeks 
1	lady because she has forgot his name 
1	she d sleep that trouble away though it must be
1	a heavy trouble to forget his name 
1	if she had better sense 
1	your own house lady 
1	she sleeps high up on wintry knock na rea
1	in an old cairn of stones while her poor women
1	must lie and jog in the wave if they would sleep 
1	being water born yet if she cry their names
1	they run up on the land and dance in the moon
1	till they are giddy and would love as men do 
1	and be as patient and as pitiful 
1	but there is nothing that will stop in their heads
1	they ve such poor memories though they weep for it 
1	oh yes they weep that s when the moon is full 
1	is it because they have short memories
1	they live so long 
1	what s memory but the ash
1	that chokes our fires that have begun to sink 
1	and they ve a dizzy everlasting fire 
1	there is your own house lady 
1	why that s true 
1	and we d have passed it without noticing 
1	a curse upon it for a meddlesome house 
1	had it but stayed away i would have known
1	what queen maeve thinks on when the moon is pinched 
1	and whether now as in the old days the dancers
1	set their brief love on men 
1	rest on my arm 
1	these are no thoughts for any christian ear 
1	i am younger she would be too heavy for you 
1	this hollow box remembers every foot
1	that danced upon the level grass of the world 
1	and will tell secrets if i whisper to it 
1	lift up the white knee 
1	hear what they sing 
1	those young dancers
1	that in a ring
1	of the hearts that brake
1	long long ago
1	for their sake 
1	new friends are sweet 
1	 but the dance changes 
1	lift up the gown 
1	all that sorrow
1	is trodden down 
1	the empty rattle pate lean on this arm 
1	that i can tell you is a christened arm 
1	and not like some if we are to judge by speech 
1	but as you please it is time i was forgot 
1	maybe it is not on this arm you slumbered
1	when you were as helpless as a worm 
1	stay with me till we come to your own house 
1	cathleen sitting down 
1	when i am rested i will need no help 
1	i thought to have kept her from remembering
1	the evil of the times for full ten minutes 
1	but now when seven are out you come between 
1	talk on what does it matter what you say 
1	for you have not been christened 
1	old woman old woman 
1	you robbed her of three minutes peace of mind 
1	and though you live unto a hundred years 
1	and wash the feet of beggars and give alms 
1	and climb croaghpatrick you shall not be pardoned 
1	how does a man who never was baptized
1	know what heaven pardons 
1	you are a sinful woman 
1	i care no more than if a pig had grunted 
1	i am not to blame for i had locked the gate 
1	the forester s to blame the men climbed in
1	at the east corner where the elm tree is 
1	i do not understand you who has climbed 
1	then god be thanked i am the first to tell you 
1	i was afraid some other of the servants 
1	though i ve been on the watch had been the first 
1	and mixed up truth and lies your ladyship 
1	cathleen rising 
1	has some misfortune happened 
1	yes indeed 
1	the forester that let the branches lie
1	against the wall s to blame for everything 
1	for that is how the rogues got into the garden 
1	i thought to have escaped misfortune here 
1	has any one been killed 
1	oh no not killed 
1	they have stolen half a cart load of green cabbage 
1	but maybe they were starving 
1	that is certain 
1	to rob or starve that was the choice they had 
1	a learned theologian has laid down
1	that starving men may take what s necessary 
1	and yet be sinless 
1	sinless and a thief 
1	there should be broken bottles on the wall 
1	and if it be a sin while faith s unbroken
1	god cannot help but pardon there is no soul
1	but it s unlike all others in the world 
1	nor one but lifts a strangeness to god s love
1	till that s grown infinite and therefore none
1	whose loss were less than irremediable
1	although it were the wickedest in the world 
1	what are you running for pull off your cap 
1	do you not see who s there 
1	i cannot wait 
1	i am running to the world with the best news
1	that has been brought it for a thousand years 
1	then get your breath and speak 
1	if you d my news
1	you d run as fast and be as out of breath 
1	such news we shall be carried on men s shoulders 
1	there s something every man has carried with him
1	and thought no more about than if it were
1	a mouthful of the wind and now it s grown
1	a marketable thing 
1	and yet it seemed
1	as useless as the paring of one s nails 
1	what sets me laughing when i think of it 
1	is that a rogue who s lain in lousy straw 
1	if he but sell it may set up his coach 
1	teig laughing 
1	there are two gentlemen who buy men s souls 
1	and maybe there s no soul at all 
1	they re drunk or mad 
1	look at the price they give 
1	shemus tossing up money 
1	 go cry it all about the world they said 
1	 money for souls good money for a soul 
1	give twice and thrice and twenty times their money 
1	and get your souls again i will pay all 
1	not we not we for souls if there are souls 
1	but keep the flesh out of its merriment 
1	i shall be drunk and merry 
1	come let s away 
1	but there s a world to come 
1	and if there is 
1	i d rather trust myself into the hands
1	that can pay money down than to the hands
1	that have but shaken famine from the bag 
1	 there s money for a soul sweet yellow money 
1	there s money for men s souls good money money 
1	go call them here again bring them by force 
1	beseech them bribe do anything you like 
1	and you too follow add your prayers to his 
1	 oona who has been praying goes out 
1	steward you know the secrets of my house 
1	how much have i 
1	a hundred kegs of gold 
1	how much have i in castles 
1	as much more 
1	how much have i in pasture 
1	as much more 
1	how much have i in forests 
1	as much more 
1	keeping this house alone sell all i have 
1	go barter where you please but come again
1	with herds of cattle and with ships of meal 
1	god s blessing light upon your ladyship 
1	you will have saved the land 
1	make no delay 
1	 aleel and oona return 
1	they have not come speak quickly 
1	one drew his knife
1	and said that he would kill the man or woman
1	that stopped his way and when i would have stopped him
1	he made this stroke at me but it is nothing 
1	you shall be tended from this day for ever
1	i ll have no joy or sorrow of my own 
1	their eyes shone like the eyes of birds of prey 
1	come follow me for the earth burns my feet
1	till i have changed my house to such a refuge
1	that the old and ailing and all weak of heart 
1	may escape from beak and claw all all shall come
1	till the walls burst and the roof fall on us 
1	from this day out i have nothing of my own 
1	she has found something now to put her hand to 
1	and you and i are of no more account
1	than flies upon a window pane in the winter 
1	scene hall in the house of countess cathleen at the left an
1	wall more or less repeating the form of the oratory and a great
1	cathleen is kneeling in front of the altar in the oratory there
1	i have come to bid you leave this castle and fly
1	out of these woods 
1	what evil is there here
1	that is not everywhere from this to the sea 
1	they who have sent me walk invisible 
1	so it is true what i have heard men say 
1	that you have seen and heard what others cannot 
1	i was asleep in my bed and while i slept
1	my dream became a fire and in the fire
1	one walked and he had birds about his head 
1	i have heard that one of the old gods walked so 
1	it may be that he is angelical 
1	and lady he bids me call you from these woods 
1	and you must bring but your old foster mother 
1	and some few serving men and live in the hills 
1	among the sounds of music and the light
1	of waters till the evil days are done 
1	for here some terrible death is waiting you 
1	some unimagined evil some great darkness
1	that fable has not dreamt of nor sun nor moon
1	no not angelical 
1	this house
1	you are to leave with some old trusty man 
1	and bid him shelter all that starve or wander
1	while there is food and house room 
1	he bids me go
1	where none of mortal creatures but the swan
1	dabbles and there you would pluck the harp when the trees
1	had made a heavy shadow about our door 
1	and talk among the rustling of the reeds 
1	when night hunted the foolish sun away
1	with stillness and pale tapers no no no 
1	i cannot although i weep i do not weep
1	because that life would be most happy and here
1	i find no way no end nor do i weep
1	because i had longed to look upon your face 
1	but that a night of prayer has made me weary 
1	aleel prostrating himself before her 
1	let him that made mankind the angels and devils
1	and dearth and plenty mend what he has made 
1	for when we labour in vain and eye still sees
1	heart breaks in vain 
1	how would that quiet end 
1	how but in healing 
1	you have seen my tears
1	and i can see your hand shake on the floor 
1	aleel faltering 
1	i thought but of healing he was angelical 
1	cathleen turning away from him 
1	no not angelical but of the old gods 
1	who wander about the world to waken the heart 
1	the passionate proud heart that all the angels 
1	leaving nine heavens empty would rock to sleep 
1	do not hold out to me beseeching hands 
1	this heart shall never waken on earth i have sworn 
1	by her whose heart the seven sorrows have pierced 
1	to pray before this altar until my heart
1	has grown to heaven like a tree and there
1	rustled its leaves till heaven has saved my people 
1	aleel who has risen 
1	when one so great has spoken of love to one
1	so little as i though to deny him love 
1	what can he but hold out beseeching hands 
1	then let them fall beside him knowing how greatly
1	they have overdared 
1	if the old tales are true 
1	queens have wed shepherds and kings beggar maids 
1	god s procreant waters flowing about your mind
1	have made you more than kings or queens and not you
1	but i am the empty pitcher 
1	being silent 
1	i have said all yet let me stay beside you 
1	no no not while my heart is shaken no 
1	but you shall hear wind cry and water cry 
1	and curlew cry and have the peace i longed for 
1	give me your hand to kiss 
1	i kiss your forehead 
1	and yet i send you from me do not speak 
1	there have been women that bid men to rob
1	crowns from the country under wave or apples
1	upon a dragon guarded hill and all
1	that they might sift men s hearts and wills 
1	and trembled as they bid it as i tremble
1	that lay a hard task on you that you go 
1	and silently and do not turn your head 
1	goodbye but do not turn your head and look 
1	above all else i would not have you look 
1	i never spoke to him of his wounded hand 
1	and now he is gone she looks out 
1	i cannot see him for all is dark outside 
1	would my imagination and my heart
1	were as little shaken as this holy flame 
1	they are ringing the alarm and in a moment
1	they ll be upon us 
1	first merchant going to a door at the side 
1	you d my commands to put them all to sleep 
1	some angel or else her prayers protected them 
1	she has fallen asleep 
1	we ve all the treasure now 
1	so let s away before they ve tracked us out 
1	i have a plan to win her 
1	you have time enough
1	if you would kill her and bear off her soul
1	before they are upon us with their prayers 
1	they search the western tower 
1	we cannot face the heavenly host in arms 
1	her soul must come to us of its own will 
1	but being of the ninth and mightiest hell
1	where all are kings i have a plan to win it 
1	lady we ve news that s crying out for speech 
1	 cathleen wakes and comes to door of chapel 
1	who calls 
1	we have brought news 
1	what are you 
1	we are merchants and we know the book of the world
1	because we have walked upon its leaves and there
1	have read of late matters that much concern you 
1	and noticing the castle door stand open 
1	came in to find an ear 
1	the door stands open 
1	that no one who is famished or afraid 
1	despair of help or of a welcome with it 
1	but you have news you say 
1	we saw a man 
1	heavy with sickness in the bog of allen 
1	whom you had bid buy cattle near fair head
1	we saw your grain ships lying all becalmed
1	in the dark night and not less still than they 
1	burned all their mirrored lanthorns in the sea 
1	my thanks to god to mary and the angels 
1	that i have money in my treasury 
1	and can buy grain from those who have stored it up
1	to prosper on the hunger of the poor 
1	but you ve been far and know the signs of things 
1	when will this famine end 
1	day copies day 
1	and there s no sign of change nor can it change 
1	with the wheat withered and the cattle dead 
1	and heard you of the demons who buy souls 
1	there are some men who hold they have wolves heads 
1	and say their limbs dried by the infinite flame 
1	have all the speed of storms others again 
1	say they are gross and little while a few
1	will have it they seem much as mortals are 
1	but tall and brown and travelled like us lady 
1	yet all agree a power is in their looks
1	that makes men bow and flings a casting net
1	about their souls and that all men would go
1	and barter those poor vapours were it not
1	you bribe them with the safety of your gold 
1	praise be to god to mary and the angels
1	that i am wealthy wherefore do they sell 
1	as we came in at the great door we saw
1	your porter sleeping in his niche a soul
1	too little to be worth a hundred pence 
1	and yet they buy it for a hundred crowns 
1	but for a soul like yours i heard them say 
1	they would give five hundred thousand crowns and more 
1	how can a heap of crowns pay for a soul 
1	is the green grave so terrible a thing 
1	some sell because the money gleams and some
1	because they are in terror of the grave 
1	and some because their neighbours sold before 
1	and some because there is a kind of joy
1	in casting hope away in losing joy 
1	in ceasing all resistance in at last
1	opening one s arms to the eternal flames 
1	in casting all sails out upon the wind 
1	to this full of the gaiety of the lost 
1	would all folk hurry if your gold were gone 
1	there is a something merchant in your voice
1	that makes me fear when you were telling how
1	a man may lose his soul and lose his god
1	your eyes were lighted up and when you told
1	how my poor money serves the people both 
1	merchants forgive me seemed to smile 
1	i laugh
1	to think that all these people should be swung
1	as on a lady s shoe string under them
1	the glowing leagues of never ending flame 
1	there is a something in you that i fear 
1	a something not of us were you not born
1	in some most distant corner of the world 
1	away now they are in the passage hurry 
1	for they will know us and freeze up our hearts
1	with ave marys and burn all our skin
1	with holy water 
1	farewell for we must ride
1	many a mile before the morning come 
1	our horses beat the ground impatiently 
1	 they go out a number of peasants enter by other door 
1	forgive us lady but we heard a noise 
1	we sat by the fireside telling vanities 
1	we heard a noise but though we have searched the house
1	we have found nobody 
1	you are too timid 
1	for now you are safe from all the evil times 
1	there is no evil that can find you here 
1	oona entering hurriedly 
1	ochone ochone the treasure room is broken in 
1	the door stands open and the gold is gone 
1	 peasants raise a lamentable cry 
1	be silent the cry ceases have you seen nobody 
1	that my good mistress should lose all this money 
1	let those among you not too old to ride 
1	get horses and search all the country round 
1	i ll give a farm to him who finds the thieves 
1	demons were here i sat beside the door
1	in my stone niche and two owls passed me by 
1	whispering with human voices 
1	god forsakes us 
1	old man old man he never closed a door
1	unless one opened i am desolate 
1	because of a strange thought that s in my heart 
1	but i have still my faith therefore be silent 
1	for surely he does not forsake the world 
1	but stands before it modelling in the clay
1	and moulding there his image age by age
1	the clay wars with his fingers and pleads hard
1	for its old heavy dull and shapeless ease 
1	but sometimes though his hand is on it still 
1	it moves awry and demon hordes are born 
1	 peasants cross themselves 
1	yet leave me now for i am desolate 
1	i hear a whisper from beyond the thunder 
1	 she comes from the oratory door 
1	yet stay an instant when we meet again
1	i may have grown forgetful oona take
1	these two the larder and the dairy keys 
1	but take you this it opens the small room
1	of herbs for medicine of hellebore 
1	of vervain monkshood plantain and self heal 
1	the book of cures is on the upper shelf 
1	why do you do this lady did you see
1	your coffin in a dream 
1	ah no not that 
1	but i have come to a strange thought i have heard
1	a sound of wailing in unnumbered hovels 
1	and i must go down down i know not where 
1	pray for all men and women mad from famine 
1	pray you good neighbours 
1	mary queen of angels 
1	and all you clouds on clouds of saints farewell 
1	scene a wood near the castle as in scene ii a group of 
1	peasants pass 
1	i have seen silver and copper but not gold 
1	it s yellow and it shines 
1	it s beautiful 
1	the most beautiful thing under the sun 
1	that s what i ve heard 
1	i have seen gold enough 
1	i would not say that it s so beautiful 
1	but doesn t a gold piece glitter like the sun 
1	that s what my father who d seen better days 
1	told me when i was but a little boy 
1	so high so high it s shining like the sun 
1	round and shining that is what he said 
1	there s nothing in the world it cannot buy 
1	they ve bags and bags of it 
1	impetuous heart be still be still 
1	your sorrowful love can never be told 
1	cover it up with a lonely tune 
1	he who could bend all things to his will
1	has covered the door of the infinite fold
1	with the pale stars and the wandering moon 
1	thanks to that lie i told about her ships
1	and that about the herdsman lying sick 
1	we shall be too much thronged with souls to morrow 
1	what has she in her coffers now but mice 
1	when the night fell and i had shaped myself
1	into the image of the man headed owl 
1	i hurried to the cliffs of donegal 
1	and saw with all their canvas full of wind
1	and rushing through the parti coloured sea
1	those ships that bring the woman grain and meal 
1	they re but three days from us 
1	when the dew rose
1	i hurried in like feathers to the east 
1	and saw nine hundred oxen driven through meath
1	with goads of iron they re but three days from us 
1	three days for traffic 
1	 peasants crowd in with teig and shemus 
1	come in come in you are welcome 
1	that is my wife she mocked at my great masters 
1	and would not deal with them now there she is 
1	she does not even know she was a fool 
1	so great a fool she was 
1	she would not eat
1	one crumb of bread bought with our master s money 
1	but lived on nettles dock and dandelion 
1	there s nobody could put into her head
1	that death is the worst thing can happen us 
1	though that sounds simple for her tongue grew rank
1	with all the lies that she had heard in chapel 
1	draw to the curtain teig draws it you ll not play the fool
1	while these good gentlemen are there to save you 
1	since the drought came they drift about in a throng 
1	like autumn leaves blown by the dreary winds

1	there is more 
1	the souls that you have bought must be set free

1	being my own it seems a priceless thing 
1	i offer my own soul 
1	do not do not for souls the like of ours
1	are not precious to god as your soul is 
1	o what would heaven do without you lady 
1	look how their claws clutch in their leathern gloves 
1	five hundred thousand crowns we give the price 
1	the gold is here the souls even while you speak
1	have slipped out of our bond because your face
1	has shed a light on them and filled their hearts 
1	but you must sign for we omit no form
1	in buying a soul like yours 
1	sign with this quill
1	it was a feather growing on the cock
1	that crowed when peter dared deny his master 
1	and all who use it have great honour in hell 
1	 cathleen leans forward to sign 
1	aleel rushing forward and snatching the
1	pen from her 
1	leave all things to the builder of the heavens 
1	i have no thoughts i hear a cry a cry 
1	aleel casting the pen on the ground 
1	i have seen a vision under a green hedge 
1	a hedge of hips and haws men yet shall hear
1	the archangels rolling satan s empty skull
1	over the mountain tops 
1	take him away 
1	take up the money and now come with me 
1	when we are far from this polluted place
1	i will give everybody money enough 
1	 she goes out the peasants crowding round her and kissing her
1	we must away and wait until she dies 
1	sitting above her tower as two grey owls 
1	waiting as many years as may be guarding
1	we need but hover over her head in the air 
1	for she has only minutes when she signed
1	her heart began to break hush hush i hear
1	the brazen door of hell move on its hinges 
1	and the eternal revelry float hither
1	to hearten us 
1	leap feathered on the air
1	and meet them with her soul caught in your claws 
1	the brazen door stands wide and balor comes
1	borne in his heavy car and demons have lifted
1	the age weary eyelids from the eyes that of old
1	turned gods to stone barach the traitor comes
1	and the lascivious race cailitin 
1	that cast a druid weakness and decay
1	over sualtem s and old dectera s child 
1	and that great king hell first took hold upon
1	when he killed naisi and broke deirdre s heart
1	and all their heads are twisted to one side 
1	for when they lived they warred on beauty and peace
1	with obstinate crafty sidelong bitterness 
1	crouch down old heron out of the blind storm 
1	where is the countess cathleen all this day
1	her eyes were full of tears and when for a moment
1	her hand was laid upon my hand it trembled 
1	and now i do not know where she is gone 
1	cathleen has chosen other friends than us 
1	and they are rising through the hollow world 
1	demons are out old heron 
1	god guard her soul 
1	she s bartered it away this very hour 
1	as though we two were never in the world 
1	 he points downward 
1	first orchill her pale beautiful head
1	her body shadowy as vapour drifting
1	under the dawn for she who awoke desire
1	has but a heart of blood when others die 
1	about her is a vapoury multitude
1	of women alluring devils with soft laughter 
1	behind her a host heat of the blood made sin 
1	but all the little pink white nails have grown
1	to be great talons 
1	they begin a song
1	and there is still some music on their tongues 
1	oona casting herself face downwards on the floor 
1	o maker of all protect her from the demons 
1	and if a soul must need be lost take mine 
1	o that so many pitchers of rough clay
1	should prosper and the porcelain break in two 
1	 she kisses the hands of cathleen 
1	we were under the tree where the path turns 
1	when she grew pale as death and fainted away 
1	and while we bore her hither cloudy gusts
1	blackened the world and shook us on our feet 
1	draw the great bolt for no man has beheld
1	so black bitter blinding and sudden a storm 
1	 one who is near the door draws the bolt 
1	o hold me and hold me tightly for the storm
1	is dragging me away 
1	 oona takes her in her arms a woman begins to wail 
1	cathleen half rising 
1	lay all the bags of money in a heap 
1	and when i am gone old oona share them out
1	to every man and woman judge and give
1	according to their needs 
1	and will she give
1	enough to keep my children through the dearth 
1	o queen of heaven and all you blessed saints 
1	let us and ours be lost so she be shriven 
1	bend down your faces oona and aleel 
1	i gaze upon them as the swallow gazes
1	upon the nest under the eave before
1	she wander the loud waters do not weep
1	too great a while for there is many a candle
1	on the high altar though one fall aleel 
1	who sang about the dancers of the woods 
1	that know not the hard burden of the world 
1	having but breath in their kind bodies farewell 
1	and farewell oona you who played with me 
1	and bore me in your arms about the house
1	when i was but a child and therefore happy 
1	therefore happy even like those that dance 
1	the storm is in my hair and i must go 
1	bring me the looking glass 
1	o she is dead 
1	she was the great white lily of the world 
1	she was more beautiful than the pale stars 
1	the little plant i love is broken in two 
1	i shatter you in fragments for the face
1	that brimmed you up with beauty is no more 
1	and die dull heart for she whose mournful words
1	made you a living spirit has passed away
1	and left you but a ball of passionate dust 
1	and you proud earth and plumy sea fade out 
1	for you may hear no more her faltering feet 
1	but are left lonely amid the clamorous war
1	of angels upon devils 
1	and i who weep
1	call curses on you time and fate and change 
1	and have no excellent hope but the great hour
1	when you shall plunge headlong through bottomless space 
1	 a flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder 
1	pull him upon his knees before his curses
1	have plucked thunder and lightning on our heads 
1	angels and devils clash in the middle air 
1	and brazen swords clang upon brazen helms 
1	 a flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder 
1	yonder a bright spear cast out of a sling 
1	has torn through balor s eye and the dark clans
1	fly screaming as they fled moytura of old 
1	 everything is lost in darkness 
1	the almighty wrath at our great weakness and sin
1	has blotted out the world and we must die 
1	look no more on the half closed gates of hell 
1	but speak to me whose mind is smitten of god 
1	that it may be no more with mortal things 
1	and tell of her who lies there 
1	 he seizes one of the angels 
1	till you speak
1	you shall not drift into eternity 
1	the light beats down the gates of pearl are wide
1	and she is passing to the floor of peace 
1	and mary of the seven times wounded heart
1	has kissed her lips and the long blessed hair
1	has fallen on her face the light of lights
1	looks always on the motive not the deed 
1	the shadow of shadows on the deed alone 
1	 aleel releases the angel and kneels 
1	tell them who walk upon the floor of peace
1	that i would die and go to her i love 
1	the years like great black oxen tread the world 
1	and god the herdsman goads them on behind
1	and i am broken by their passing feet 
1	 sero te amavi pulchritudo tam antiqua et tam nova sero te
1	 red rose proud rose sad rose of all my days 
1	come near me while i sing the ancient ways 
1	cuchulain battling with the bitter tide 
1	the druid gray wood nurtured quiet eyed 
1	who cast round fergus dreams and ruin untold 
1	and thine own sadness whereof stars grown old
1	in dancing silver sandalled on the sea 
1	sing in their high and lonely melody 
1	come near that no more blinded by man s fate 
1	i find under the boughs of love and hate 
1	in all poor foolish things that live a day 
1	eternal beauty wandering on her way 
1	 come near come near come near ah leave me still
1	a little space for the rose breath to fill 
1	lest i no more hear common things that crave 
1	the weak worm hiding down in its small cave 
1	 the field mouse running by me in the grass 
1	and heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass 
1	but seek alone to hear the strange things said
1	by god to the bright hearts of those long dead 
1	and learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know 
1	come near i would before my time to go 
1	sing of old eire and the ancient ways 
1	red rose proud rose sad rose of all my days 
1	the whole day have i followed in the rocks 
1	and you have changed and flowed from shape to shape 
1	first as a raven on whose ancient wings
1	scarcely a feather lingered then you seemed
1	a weasel moving on from stone to stone 
1	and now at last you wear a human shape 
1	a thin gray man half lost in gathering night 
1	what would you king of the proud red branch kings 
1	this would i say most wise of living souls 
1	young subtle concobar sat close by me
1	when i gave judgment and his words were wise 
1	and what to me was burden without end 
1	to him seemed easy so i laid the crown
1	upon his head to cast away my care 
1	what would you king of the proud red branch kings 
1	i feast amid my people on the hill 
1	and pace the woods and drive my chariot wheels
1	in the white border of the murmuring sea 
1	and still i feel the crown upon my head 
1	what would you 
1	i would be no more a king
1	but learn the dreaming wisdom that is yours 
1	look on my thin gray hair and hollow cheeks
1	and on these hands that may not lift the sword
1	this body trembling like a wind blown reed 
1	no woman loves me no man seeks my help 
1	because i be not of the things i dream 
1	a wild and foolish labourer is a king 
1	to do and do and do and never dream 
1	take if you must this little bag of dreams 
1	unloose the cord and they will wrap you round 
1	i see my life go dripping like a stream
1	from change to change i have been many things 
1	a green drop in the surge a gleam of light
1	upon a sword a fir tree on a hill 
1	an old slave grinding at a heavy quern 
1	a king sitting upon a chair of gold 
1	and all these things were wonderful and great 
1	but now i have grown nothing being all 
1	and the whole world weighs down upon my heart 
1	ah druid druid how great webs of sorrow
1	lay hidden in the small slate coloured bag 
1	a man came slowly from the setting sun 
1	to forgail s daughter emer in her dun 
1	and found her dyeing cloth with subtle care 
1	and said casting aside his draggled hair 
1	 i am aleel the swineherd whom you bid
1	 go dwell upon the sea cliffs vapour hid 
1	 but now my years of watching are no more 
1	then emer cast the web upon the floor 
1	and stretching out her arms red with the dye 
1	parted her lips with a loud sudden cry 
1	looking on her aleel the swineherd said 
1	 not any god alive nor mortal dead 
1	 has slain so mighty armies so great kings 
1	 nor won the gold that now cuchulain brings 
1	 why do you tremble thus from feet to crown 
1	aleel the swineherd wept and cast him down
1	upon the web heaped floor and thus his word 
1	 with him is one sweet throated like a bird 
1	 who bade you tell these things and then she cried
1	to those about beat him with thongs of hide
1	 and drive him from the door 
1	and thus it was 
1	and where her son finmole on the smooth grass
1	was driving cattle came she with swift feet 
1	and called out to him son it is not meet
1	 that you stay idling here with flocks and herds 
1	 i have long waited mother for those words 
1	 but wherefore now 
1	 there is a man to die 
1	 you have the heaviest arm under the sky 
1	 my father dwells among the sea worn bands 
1	 and breaks the ridge of battle with his hands 
1	 nay you are taller than cuchulain son 
1	 he is the mightiest man in ship or dun 
1	 nay he is old and sad with many wars 
1	 and weary of the crash of battle cars 
1	 i only ask what way my journey lies 
1	 for god who made you bitter made you wise 
1	 the red branch kings a tireless banquet keep 
1	 where the sun falls into the western deep 
1	 go there and dwell on the green forest rim 
1	 but tell alone your name and house to him
1	 whose blade compels and bid them send you one
1	 who has a like vow from their triple dun 
1	between the lavish shelter of a wood
1	and the gray tide the red branch multitude
1	feasted and with them old cuchulain dwelt 
1	and his young dear one close beside him knelt 
1	and gazed upon the wisdom of his eyes 
1	more mournful than the depth of starry skies 
1	and pondered on the wonder of his days 
1	and all around the harp string told his praise 
1	and concobar the red branch king of kings 
1	with his own fingers touched the brazen strings 
1	at last cuchulain spake a young man strays
1	 driving the deer along the woody ways 
1	 i often hear him singing to and fro 
1	 i often hear the sweet sound of his bow 
1	 seek out what man he is 
1	one went and came 
1	 he bade me let all know he gives his name
1	 at the sword point and bade me bring him one
1	 who had a like vow from our triple dun 
1	 i only of the red branch hosted now 
1	cuchulain cried have made and keep that vow 
1	after short fighting in the leafy shade 
1	he spake to the young man is there no maid
1	 who loves you no white arms to wrap you round 
1	 or do you long for the dim sleepy ground 
1	 that you come here to meet this ancient sword 
1	 the dooms of men are in god s hidden hoard 
1	 your head a while seemed like a woman s head
1	 that i loved once 
1	again the fighting sped 
1	but now the war rage in cuchulain woke 
1	and through the other s shield his long blade broke 
1	and pierced him 
1	 speak before your breath is done 
1	 i am finmole mighty cuchulain s son 
1	 i put you from your pain i can no more 
1	while day its burden on to evening bore 
1	with head bowed on his knees cuchulain stayed 
1	then concobar sent that sweet throated maid 
1	and she to win him his gray hair caressed 
1	in vain her arms in vain her soft white breast 
1	then concobar the subtlest of all men 
1	ranking his druids round him ten by ten 
1	spake thus cuchulain will dwell there and brood 
1	 for three days more in dreadful quietude 
1	 and then arise and raving slay us all 
1	 go cast on him delusions magical 
1	 that he might fight the waves of the loud sea 
1	and ten by ten under a quicken tree 
1	the druids chaunted swaying in their hands
1	tall wands of alder and white quicken wands 
1	in three days time cuchulain with a moan
1	stood up and came to the long sands alone 
1	for four days warred he with the bitter tide 
1	and the waves flowed above him and he died 
1	who dreamed that beauty passes like a dream 
1	for these red lips with all their mournful pride 
1	mournful that no new wonder may betide 
1	troy passed away in one high funeral gleam 
1	and usna s children died 
1	we and the labouring world are passing by 
1	amid men s souls that waver and give place 
1	like the pale waters in their wintry race 
1	under the passing stars foam of the sky 
1	lives on this lonely face 
1	bow down archangels in your dim abode 
1	before you were or any hearts to beat 
1	weary and kind one lingered by his seat 
1	he made the world to be a grassy road
1	before her wandering feet 
1	if michael leader of god s host
1	when heaven and hell are met 
1	looked down on you from heaven s door post
1	he would his deeds forget 
1	brooding no more upon god s wars
1	in his divine homestead 
1	he would go weave out of the stars
1	a chaplet for your head 
1	and all folk seeing him bow down 
1	and white stars tell your praise 
1	would come at last to god s great town 
1	led on by gentle ways 
1	and god would bid his warfare cease 
1	saying all things were well 
1	and softly make a rosy peace 
1	a peace of heaven with hell 
1	the tall thought woven sails that flap unfurled
1	above the tide of hours trouble the air 
1	and god s bell buoyed to be the water s care 
1	while hushed from fear or loud with hope a band
1	with blown spray dabbled hair gather at hand 
1	 turn if you may from battles never done 
1	i call as they go by me one by one 
1	 danger no refuge holds and war no peace 
1	for him who hears love sing and never cease 
1	beside her clean swept hearth her quiet shade 
1	but gather all for whom no love hath made
1	a woven silence or but came to cast
1	a song into the air and singing past
1	to smile on the pale dawn and gather you
1	who have sought more than is in rain or dew
1	or in the sun and moon or on the earth 
1	 or sighs amid the wandering starry mirth 
1	or comes in laughter from the sea s sad lips
1	and wage god s battles in the long gray ships 
1	the sad the lonely the insatiable 
1	to these old night shall all her mystery tell 
1	god s bell has claimed them by the little cry
1	of their sad hearts that may not live nor die 
1	you too have come where the dim tides are hurled
1	upon the wharves of sorrow and heard ring
1	the bell that calls us on the sweet far thing 
1	beauty grown sad with its eternity
1	made you of us and of the dim gray sea 
1	our long ships loose thought woven sails and wait 
1	for god has bid them share an equal fate 
1	and when at last defeated in his wars 
1	they have gone down under the same white stars 
1	we shall no longer hear the little cry
1	of our sad hearts that may not live nor die 
1	 sung by the people of faery over diarmuid and grania who lay in
1	we who are old old and gay 
1	o so old 
1	thousands of years thousands of years 
1	if all were told 
1	give to these children new from the world 
1	silence and love 
1	and the long dew dropping hours of the night 
1	and the stars above 
1	give to these children new from the world 
1	rest far from men 
1	is anything better anything better 
1	tell us it then 
1	us who are old old and gay 
1	o so old 
1	thousands of years thousands of years 
1	if all were told 
1	i will arise and go now and go to innisfree 
1	and a small cabin build there of clay and wattles made 
1	nine bean rows will i have there a hive for the honey bee 
1	and live alone in the bee loud glade 
1	and i shall have some peace there for peace comes dropping slow 
1	and evening full of the linnet s wings 
1	i will arise and go now for always night and day
1	i hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore 
1	while i stand on the roadway or on the pavements gray 
1	i hear it in the deep heart s core 
1	 coth yani me von gilli beg 
1	 n heur ve thu more a creena 
1	the angels are stooping
1	above your bed 
1	they weary of trooping
1	with the whimpering dead 
1	god s laughing in heaven
1	to see you so good 
1	are gay with his mood 
1	i kiss you and kiss you 
1	my pigeon my own 
1	ah how i shall miss you
1	when you have grown 
1	a pity beyond all telling
1	is hid in the heart of love 
1	the folk who are buying and selling
1	the clouds on their journey above
1	the cold wet winds ever blowing
1	and the shadowy hazel grove
1	where mouse gray waters are flowing
1	threaten the head that i love 
1	the quarrel of the sparrows in the eaves 
1	the full round moon and the star laden sky 
1	and the loud song of the ever singing leaves 
1	had hid away earth s old and weary cry 
1	and then you came with those red mournful lips 
1	and with you came the whole of the world s tears
1	and all the trouble of her labouring ships 
1	and all the trouble of her myriad years 
1	and now the sparrows warring in the eaves 
1	the curd pale moon the white stars in the sky 
1	and the loud chaunting of the unquiet leaves 
1	are shaken with earth s old and weary cry 
1	when you are old and gray and full of sleep 
1	and nodding by the fire take down this book 
1	and slowly read and dream of the soft look
1	your eyes had once and of their shadows deep 
1	how many loved your moments of glad grace 
1	and loved your beauty will love false or true 
1	but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you 
1	and loved the sorrows of your changing face 
1	and bending down beside the glowing bars
1	murmur a little sadly how love fled
1	and paced upon the mountains overhead
1	and hid his face amid a crowd of stars 
1	and the flame of the blue star of twilight hung low
1	on the rim of the sky 
1	has awaked in our hearts my beloved a sadness that may not die 
1	in the fall of the dew 
1	for i would we were changed to white birds on the
1	wandering foam i and you 
1	i am haunted by numberless islands and many a danaan shore 
1	i dreamed that one had died in a strange place
1	near no accustomed hand 
1	and they had nailed the boards above her face
1	the peasants of that land 
1	wondering to lay her in that solitude 
1	and raised above her mound
1	a cross they had made out of two bits of wood 
1	and planted cypress round 
1	and left her to the indifferent stars above
1	until i carved these words 
1	 she was more beautiful than thy first love 
1	but now lies under boards 
1	all the heavy days are over 
1	leave the body s coloured pride
1	underneath the grass and clover 
1	with the feet laid side by side 
1	one with her are mirth and duty 
1	bear the gold embroidered dress 
1	for she needs not her sad beauty 
1	to the scented oaken press 
1	hers the kiss of mother mary 
1	the long hair is on her face 
1	still she goes with footsteps wary 
1	full of earth s old timid grace 
1	with white feet of angels seven
1	her white feet go glimmering
1	and above the deep of heaven 
1	flame on flame and wing on wing 
1	who will go drive with fergus now 
1	and pierce the deep wood s woven shade 
1	and dance upon the level shore 
1	young man lift up your russet brow 
1	and lift your tender eyelids maid 
1	and brood on hopes and fears no more 
1	and no more turn aside and brood
1	upon love s bitter mystery 
1	for fergus rules the brazen cars 
1	and rules the shadows of the wood 
1	and the white breast of the dim sea
1	and all dishevelled wandering stars 
1	he stood among a crowd at drumahair 
1	his heart hung all upon a silken dress 
1	and he had known at last some tenderness 
1	before earth made of him her sleepy care 
1	but when a man poured fish into a pile 
1	it seemed they raised their little silver heads 
1	and sang how day a druid twilight sheds
1	upon a dim green well beloved isle 
1	where people love beside star laden seas 
1	how time may never mar their faery vows
1	under the woven roofs of quicken boughs 
1	the singing shook him out of his new ease 
1	he wandered by the sands of lisadill 
1	his mind ran all on money cares and fears 
1	and he had known at last some prudent years
1	before they heaped his grave under the hill 
1	but while he passed before a plashy place 
1	a lug worm with its gray and muddy mouth
1	sang how somewhere to north or west or south
1	there dwelt a gay exulting gentle race 
1	and how beneath those three times blessed skies
1	a danaan fruitage makes a shower of moons 
1	and as it falls awakens leafy tunes 
1	and at that singing he was no more wise 
1	he mused beside the well of scanavin 
1	he mused upon his mockers without fail
1	his sudden vengeance were a country tale 
1	now that deep earth has drunk his body in 
1	but one small knot grass growing by the pool
1	told where ah little all unneeded voice 
1	old silence bids a lonely folk rejoice 
1	and how when fades the sea strewn rose of day 
1	a gentle feeling wraps them like a fleece 
1	and all their trouble dies into its peace 
1	the tale drove his fine angry mood away 
1	he slept under the hill of lugnagall 
1	under that cold and vapour turbaned steep 
1	now that old earth had taken man and all 
1	were not the worms that spired about his bones
1	a telling with their low and reedy cry 
1	of how god leans his hands out of the sky 
1	to bless that isle with honey in his tones 
1	that none may feel the power of squall and wave
1	and no one any leaf crowned dancer miss
1	until he burn up nature with a kiss 
1	the man has found no comfort in the grave 
1	there was a green branch hung with many a bell
1	when her own people ruled in wave worn eire 
1	and from its murmuring greenness calm of faery 
1	a druid kindness on all hearers fell 
1	it charmed away the merchant from his guile 
1	and turned the farmer s memory from his cattle 
1	and hushed in sleep the roaring ranks of battle 
1	for all who heard it dreamed a little while 
1	ah exiles wandering over many seas 
1	spinning at all times eire s good to morrow 
1	ah worldwide nation always growing sorrow 
1	i also bear a bell branch full of ease 
1	i tore it from green boughs winds tossed and hurled 
1	green boughs of tossing always weary weary 
1	i tore it from the green boughs of old eire 
1	the willow of the many sorrowed world 
1	ah exiles wandering over many lands 
1	my bell branch murmurs the gay bells bring laughter 
1	leaping to shake a cobweb from the rafter 
1	the sad bells bow the forehead on the hands 
1	a honeyed ringing under the new skies
1	they bring you memories of old village faces 
1	cabins gone now old well sides old dear places 
1	and men who loved the cause that never dies 
1	i had a chair at every hearth 
1	when no one turned to see 
1	with look at that old fellow there 
1	 and who may he be 
1	and therefore do i wander now 
1	and the fret lies on me 
1	the road side trees keep murmuring
1	ah wherefore murmur ye 
1	as in the old days long gone by 
1	green oak and poplar tree 
1	the well known faces are all gone
1	and the fret lies on me 
1	the old priest peter gilligan
1	was weary night and day 
1	for half his flock were in their beds 
1	or under green sods lay 
1	once while he nodded on a chair 
1	at the moth hour of eve 
1	another poor man sent for him 
1	and he began to grieve 
1	 i have no rest nor joy nor peace 
1	 for people die and die 
1	and after cried he god forgive 
1	 my body spake not i 
1	he knelt and leaning on the chair
1	he prayed and fell asleep 
1	and the moth hour went from the fields 
1	and stars began to peep 
1	they slowly into millions grew 
1	and leaves shook in the wind 
1	and god covered the world with shade 
1	and whispered to mankind 
1	upon the time of sparrow chirp
1	when the moths came once more 
1	the old priest peter gilligan
1	stood upright on the floor 
1	 mavrone mavrone the man has died 
1	 while i slept on the chair 
1	he roused his horse out of its sleep 
1	and rode with little care 
1	he rode now as he never rode 
1	by rocky lane and fen 
1	the sick man s wife opened the door 
1	 father you come again 
1	 and is the poor man dead he cried 
1	 he died an hour ago 
1	the old priest peter gilligan
1	in grief swayed to and fro 
1	 when you were gone he turned and died
1	 as merry as a bird 
1	the old priest peter gilligan
1	he knelt him at that word 
1	 he who hath made the night of stars
1	 for souls who tire and bleed 
1	 sent one of his great angels down
1	 to help me in my need 
1	 he who is wrapped in purple robes 
1	 with planets in his care 
1	 had pity on the least of things
1	 asleep upon a chair 
1	beloved gaze in thine own heart 
1	the holy tree is growing there 
1	from joy the holy branches start 
1	and all the trembling flowers they bear 
1	the changing colours of its fruit
1	have dowered the stars with merry light 
1	the surety of its hidden root
1	has planted quiet in the night 
1	the shaking of its leafy head
1	has given the waves their melody 
1	and made my lips and music wed 
1	murmuring a wizard song for thee 
1	there through bewildered branches go
1	winged loves borne on in gentle strife 
1	tossing and tossing to and fro
1	the flaming circle of our life 
1	when looking on their shaken hair 
1	and dreaming how they dance and dart 
1	thine eyes grow full of tender care 
1	beloved gaze in thine own heart 
1	gaze no more in the bitter glass
1	the demons with their subtle guile 
1	lift up before us when they pass 
1	or only gaze a little while 
1	for there a fatal image grows 
1	with broken boughs and blackened leaves 
1	and roots half hidden under snows
1	driven by a storm that ever grieves 
1	for all things turn to barrenness
1	in the dim glass the demons hold 
1	the glass of outer weariness 
1	made when god slept in times of old 
1	there through the broken branches go
1	the ravens of unresting thought 
1	peering and flying to and fro
1	to see men s souls bartered and bought 
1	when they are heard upon the wind 
1	and when they shake their wings alas 
1	thy tender eyes grow all unkind 
1	gaze no more in the bitter glass 
1	 know that i would accounted be
1	true brother of that company 
1	who sang to sweeten ireland s wrong 
1	ballad and story rann and song 
1	nor be i any less of them 
1	because the red rose bordered hem
1	of her whose history began
1	before god made the angelic clan 
1	trails all about the written page 
1	for in the world s first blossoming age
1	the light fall of her flying feet
1	made ireland s heart begin to beat 
1	and still the starry candles flare
1	to help her light foot here and there 
1	and still the thoughts of ireland brood
1	upon her holy quietude 
1	 nor may i less be counted one
1	because to him who ponders well 
1	my rhymes more than their rhyming tell
1	of the dim wisdoms old and deep 
1	that god gives unto man in sleep 
1	for the elemental beings go
1	about my table to and fro 
1	in flood and fire and clay and wind 
1	they huddle from man s pondering mind 
1	yet he who treads in austere ways
1	may surely meet their ancient gaze 
1	man ever journeys on with them
1	after the red rose bordered hem 
1	ah faeries dancing under the moon 
1	a druid land a druid tune 
1	 while still i may i write for you
1	the love i lived the dream i knew 
1	from our birthday until we die 
1	is but the winking of an eye 
1	and we our singing and our love 
1	the mariners of night above 
1	and all the wizard things that go
1	about my table to and fro 
1	are passing on to where may be 
1	in truth s consuming ecstasy
1	no place for love and dream at all 
1	for god goes by with white foot fall 
1	i cast my heart into my rhymes 
1	that you in the dim coming times 
1	may know how my heart went with them
1	after the red rose bordered hem 
1	 o rose thou art sick 
1	 the scene is laid in the barony of kilmacowen in the county of
1	sligo and at a remote time 
1	through the trees and carries the eye far off into a vague 
1	because i bid her clean the pots for supper
1	she took that old book down out of the thatch 
1	she has been doubled over it ever since 
1	we should be deafened by her groans and moans
1	had she to work as some do father hart 
1	get up at dawn like me and mend and scour
1	or ride abroad in the boisterous night like you 
1	the pyx and blessed bread under your arm 
1	mother you are too cross 
1	you ve married her 
1	and fear to vex her and so take her part 
1	it is but right that youth should side with youth 
1	she quarrels with my wife a bit at times 
1	and is too deep just now in the old book 
1	but do not blame her greatly she will grow
1	as quiet as a puff ball in a tree
1	when but the moons of marriage dawn and die
1	for half a score of times 
1	their hearts are wild 
1	as be the hearts of birds till children come 
1	she would not mind the kettle milk the cow 
1	or even lay the knives and spread the cloth 
1	shawn this is half empty 
1	go bring up the best bottle that we have 
1	i never saw her read a book before 
1	what are you waiting for 
1	you must not shake it when you draw the cork 
1	it s precious wine so take your time about it 
1	 to priest shawn goes 
1	there was a spaniard wrecked at ocris head 
1	when i was young and i have still some bottles 
1	he cannot bear to hear her blamed the book
1	has lain up in the thatch these fifty years 
1	my father told me my grandfather wrote it 
1	and killed a heifer for the binding of it 
1	but supper s spread and we can talk and eat
1	it was little good he got out of the book 
1	because it filled his house with rambling fiddlers 
1	and rambling ballad makers and the like 
1	the griddle bread is there in front of you 
1	colleen what is the wonder in that book 
1	that you must leave the bread to cool had i
1	or had my father read or written books
1	there were no stocking stuffed with yellow guineas
1	to come when i am dead to shawn and you 
1	you should not fill your head with foolish dreams 
1	what are you reading 
1	a daughter of a king of ireland heard
1	a voice singing on a may eve like this 
1	and followed half awake and half asleep 
1	until she came into the land of faery 
1	where nobody gets old and godly and grave 
1	where nobody gets old and crafty and wise 
1	where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue 
1	and she is still there busied with a dance
1	deep in the dewy shadow of a wood 
1	or where stars walk upon a mountain top 
1	persuade the colleen to put down the book 
1	my grandfather would mutter just such things 
1	and he was no judge of a dog or a horse 
1	and any idle boy could blarney him 
1	just speak your mind 
1	put it away my colleen 
1	god spreads the heavens above us like great wings
1	and gives a little round of deeds and days 
1	and then come the wrecked angels and set snares 
1	and bait them with light hopes and heavy dreams 
1	until the heart is puffed with pride and goes
1	half shuddering and half joyous from god s peace 
1	and it was some wrecked angel blind with tears 
1	who flattered edane s heart with merry words 
1	my colleen i have seen some other girls
1	restless and ill at ease but years went by
1	and they grew like their neighbours and were glad
1	in minding children working at the churn 
1	and gossiping of weddings and of wakes 
1	for life moves out of a red flare of dreams
1	into a common light of common hours 
1	until old age bring the red flare again 
1	that s true but she s too young to know it s true 
1	she s old enough to know that it is wrong
1	to mope and idle 
1	i ve little blame for her 
1	she s dull when my big son is in the fields 
1	and that and maybe this good woman s tongue
1	have driven her to hide among her dreams
1	like children from the dark under the bed clothes 
1	she d never do a turn if i were silent 
1	and maybe it is natural upon may eve
1	to dream of the good people but tell me girl 
1	if you ve the branch of blessed quicken wood
1	that women hang upon the post of the door
1	that they may send good luck into the house 
1	remember they may steal new married brides
1	after the fall of twilight on may eve 
1	or what old women mutter at the fire
1	is but a pack of lies 
1	it may be truth 
1	we do not know the limit of those powers
1	god has permitted to the evil spirits
1	for some mysterious end you have done right to mary 
1	it s well to keep old innocent customs up 
1	i had no sooner hung it on the nail
1	before a child ran up out of the wind 
1	she has caught it in her hand and fondled it 
1	her face is pale as water before dawn 
1	whose child can this be 
1	no one s child at all 
1	she often dreams that some one has gone by 
1	when there was nothing but a puff of wind 
1	they have taken away the blessed quicken wood 
1	they will not bring good luck into the house 
1	yet i am glad that i was courteous to them 
1	for are not they likewise children of god 
1	colleen they are the children of the fiend 
1	and they have power until the end of time 
1	when god shall fight with them a great pitched battle
1	and hack them into pieces 
1	he will smile 
1	father perhaps and open his great door 
1	did but the lawless angels see that door
1	they would fall slain by everlasting peace 
1	and when such angels knock upon our doors 
1	who goes with them must drive through the same storm 
1	mary coming to table 
1	there s somebody out there that beckoned me
1	and raised her hand as though it held a cup 
1	and she was drinking from it so it may be
1	that she is thirsty 
1	 she takes milk from the table and carries it to the door 
1	that will be the child
1	that you would have it was no child at all 
1	and maybe father what he said was true 
1	for there is not another night in the year
1	so wicked as to night 
1	nothing can harm us
1	while the good father s underneath our roof 
1	a little queer old woman dressed in green 
1	the good people beg for milk and fire
1	upon may eve woe to the house that gives 
1	for they have power upon it for a year 
1	hush woman hush 
1	she s given milk away 
1	i knew she would bring evil on the house 
1	who was it 
1	both the tongue and face were strange 
1	some strangers came last week to clover hill 
1	she must be one of them 
1	i am afraid 
1	the cross will keep all evil from the house
1	while it hangs there 
1	come sit beside me colleen 
1	and put away your dreams of discontent 
1	for i would have you light up my last days 
1	like the good glow of the turf and when i die
1	you ll be the wealthiest hereabout for colleen 
1	i have a stocking full of yellow guineas
1	hidden away where nobody can find it 
1	you are the fool of every pretty face 
1	and i must spare and pinch that my son s wife
1	may have all kinds of ribbons for her head 
1	do not be cross she is a right good girl 
1	the butter is by your elbow father hart 
1	my colleen have not fate and time and change
1	done well for me and for old bridget there 
1	we have a hundred acres of good land 
1	and sit beside each other at the fire 
1	i have this reverend father for my friend 
1	i look upon your face and my son s face 
1	we ve put his plate by yours and here he comes 
1	and brings with him the only thing we have lacked 
1	abundance of good wine shawn comes in stir up the fire 
1	and put new turf upon it till it blaze 
1	to watch the turf smoke coiling from the fire 
1	and feel content and wisdom in your heart 
1	this is the best of life when we are young
1	we long to tread a way none trod before 
1	but find the excellent old way through love 
1	and through the care of children to the hour
1	for bidding fate and time and change goodbye 
1	what is it draws you to the chill o the wood 
1	there is a light among the stems of the trees
1	that makes one shiver 
1	a little queer old man
1	made me a sign to show he wanted fire
1	to light his pipe 
1	you ve given milk and fire
1	upon the unluckiest night of the year and brought 
1	for all you know evil upon the house 
1	before you married you were idle and fine
1	and went about with ribbons on your head 
1	and now no father i will speak my mind 
1	she is not a fitting wife for any man 
1	be quiet mother 
1	you are much too cross 
1	what do i care if i have given this house 
1	where i must hear all day a bitter tongue 
1	into the power of faeries 
1	you know well
1	how calling the good people by that name 
1	or talking of them over much at all 
1	may bring all kinds of evil on the house 
1	come faeries take me out of this dull house 
1	let me have all the freedom i have lost 
1	work when i will and idle when i will 
1	faeries come take me out of this dull world 
1	for i would ride with you upon the wind 
1	run on the top of the dishevelled tide 
1	and dance upon the mountains like a flame 
1	you cannot know the meaning of your words 
1	father i am right weary of four tongues 
1	a tongue that is too crafty and too wise 
1	a tongue that is too godly and too grave 
1	a tongue that is more bitter than the tide 
1	and a kind tongue too full of drowsy love 
1	of drowsy love and my captivity 
1	 shawn bruin leads her to a seat at the left of the door 
1	do not blame me i often lie awake
1	thinking that all things trouble your bright head 
1	how beautiful it is your broad pale forehead
1	under a cloudy blossoming of hair 
1	sit down beside me here these are too old 
1	and have forgotten they were ever young 
1	o you are the great door post of this house 
1	and i the branch of blessed quicken wood 
1	and if i could i d hang upon the post 
1	till i had brought good luck into the house 
1	my daughter take his hand by love alone
1	god binds us to himself and to the hearth 
1	that shuts us from the waste beyond his peace 
1	from maddening freedom and bewildering light 
1	would that the world were mine to give it you 
1	and not its quiet hearths alone but even
1	all that bewilderment of light and freedom 
1	if you would have it 
1	i would take the world
1	and break it into pieces in my hands
1	to see you smile watching it crumble away 
1	then i would mould a world of fire and dew 
1	with no one bitter grave or over wise 
1	and nothing marred or old to do you wrong 
1	and crowd the enraptured quiet of the sky
1	with candles burning to your lonely face 
1	your looks are all the candles that i need 
1	once a fly dancing in a beam of the sun 
1	or the light wind blowing out of the dawn 
1	could fill your heart with dreams none other knew 
1	but now the indissoluble sacrament
1	has mixed your heart that was most proud and cold
1	with my warm heart for ever the sun and moon
1	must fade and heaven be rolled up like a scroll 
1	but your white spirit still walk by my spirit 
1	 a voice singing in the wood 
1	there s some one singing why it s but a child 
1	it sang the lonely of heart is withered away 
1	a strange song for a child but she sings sweetly 
1	listen listen 
1	o cling close to me 
1	because i have said wicked things to night 
1	the wind blows out of the gates of the day 
1	the wind blows over the lonely of heart 
1	and the lonely of heart is withered away 
1	while the faeries dance in a place apart 
1	shaking their milk white feet in a ring 
1	tossing their milk white arms in the air 
1	for they hear the wind laugh and murmur and sing
1	of a land where even the old are fair 
1	and even the wise are merry of tongue 
1	but i heard a reed of coolaney say 
1	 when the wind has laughed and murmured and sung
1	the lonely of heart is withered away 
1	being happy i would have all others happy 
1	so i will bring her in out of the cold 
1	 he brings in the faery child 
1	i tire of winds and waters and pale lights 
1	and that s no wonder for when night has fallen
1	the wood s a cold and a bewildering place 
1	but you are welcome here 
1	i am welcome here 
1	for when i tire of this warm little house
1	there is one here that must away away 
1	o listen to her dreamy and strange talk 
1	are you not cold 
1	i will crouch down beside you 
1	for i have run a long long way this night 
1	you have a comely shape 
1	your hair is wet 
1	i ll warm your chilly feet 
1	you have come indeed
1	a long long way for i have never seen
1	your pretty face and must be tired and hungry 
1	here is some bread and wine 
1	the wine is bitter 
1	old mother have you no sweet food for me 
1	i have some honey 
1	 she goes into the next room 
1	you have coaxing ways 
1	the mother was quite cross before you came 
1	she is the child of gentle people look
1	at her white hands and at her pretty dress 
1	i ve brought you some new milk but wait a while
1	and i will put it to the fire to warm 
1	for things well fitted for poor folk like us
1	would never please a high born child like you 
1	from dawn when you must blow the fire ablaze 
1	you work your fingers to the bone old mother 
1	the young may lie in bed and dream and hope 
1	but you must work your fingers to the bone
1	because your heart is old 
1	the young are idle 
1	your memories have made you wise old father 
1	the young must sigh through many a dream and hope 
1	but you are wise because your heart is old 
1	 bridget gives her more bread and honey 
1	o who would think to find so young a girl
1	loving old age and wisdom 
1	no more mother 
1	what a small bite the milk is ready now 
1	 hands it to her what a small sip 
1	put on my shoes old mother 
1	now i would like to dance now i have eaten 
1	the reeds are dancing by coolaney lake 
1	and i would like to dance until the reeds
1	and the white waves have danced themselves asleep 
1	what is that ugly thing on the black cross 
1	you cannot know how naughty your words are 
1	hide it away 
1	i have begun to be afraid again 
1	hide it away 
1	that would be wickedness 
1	that would be sacrilege 
1	the tortured thing 
1	hide it away 
1	her parents are to blame 
1	that is the image of the son of god 
1	the child caressing him 
1	hide it away hide it away 
1	because you are so young and like a bird 
1	that must take fright at every stir of the leaves 
1	i will go take it down 
1	hide it away 
1	and cover it out of sight and out of mind 
1	since you have come into this barony 
1	i will instruct you in our blessed faith 
1	and being so keen witted you ll soon learn 
1	we must be tender to all budding things 
1	our maker let no thought of calvary
1	trouble the morning stars in their first song 
1	 puts crucifix in inner room 
1	here is level ground for dancing i will dance 
1	 the wind blows out of the gates of the day 
1	the wind blows over the lonely of heart 
1	and the lonely of heart is withered away 
1	just now when she came near i thought i heard
1	other small steps beating upon the floor 
1	and a faint music blowing in the wind 
1	invisible pipes giving her feet the tune 
1	i heard no steps but hers 
1	i hear them now 
1	the unholy powers are dancing in the house 
1	come over here and if you promise me
1	not to talk wickedly of holy things
1	i will give you something 
1	bring it me old father 
1	here are some ribbons that i bought in the town
1	for my son s wife but she will let me give them
1	to tie up that wild hair the winds have tumbled 
1	come tell me do you love me 
1	yes i love you 
1	ah but you love this fireside do you love me 
1	when the almighty puts so great a share
1	of his own ageless youth into a creature 
1	to look is but to love 
1	but you love him 
1	she is blaspheming 
1	and do you love me too 
1	i do not know 
1	you love that young man there 
1	yet i could make you ride upon the winds 
1	run on the top of the dishevelled tide 
1	and dance upon the mountains like a flame 
1	queen of angels and kind saints defend us 
1	some dreadful thing will happen a while ago
1	she took away the blessed quicken wood 
1	you fear because of her unmeasured prattle 
1	she knows no better child how old are you 
1	when winter sleep is abroad my hair grows thin 
1	my feet unsteady when the leaves awaken
1	my mother carries me in her golden arms 
1	i ll soon put on my womanhood and marry
1	the spirits of wood and water but who can tell
1	when i was born for the first time i think
1	i am much older than the eagle cock
1	that blinks and blinks on ballygawley hill 
1	and he is the oldest thing under the moon 
1	o she is of the faery people 
1	one called 
1	i sent my messengers for milk and fire 
1	she called again and after that i came 
1	though you have made all these obedient 
1	you have not charmed my sight and won from me
1	a wish or gift to make you powerful 
1	i ll turn you from the house 
1	no i will face her 
1	because you took away the crucifix
1	i am so mighty that there s none can pass 
1	unless i will it where my feet have danced
1	or where i ve whirled my finger tops 
1	 shawn tries to approach her and cannot 
1	look look 
1	there something stops him look how he moves his hands
1	as though he rubbed them on a wall of glass 
1	i will confront this mighty spirit alone 
1	be not afraid the father is with us 
1	the adoring magi in their coats of mail 
1	and he who died and rose on the third day 
1	and all the nine angelic hierarchies 
1	cry daughter to the angels and the saints 
1	you shall go with me newly married bride 
1	and gaze upon a merrier multitude 
1	white armed nuala aengus of the birds 
1	feacra of the hurtling foam and him
1	who is the ruler of the western host 
1	finvarra and their land of heart s desire 
1	where beauty has no ebb decay no flood 
1	but joy is wisdom time an endless song 
1	i kiss you and the world begins to fade 
1	awake out of that trance and cover up
1	your eyes and ears 
1	she must both look and listen 
1	for only the soul s choice can save her now 
1	come over to me daughter stand beside me 
1	think of this house and of your duties in it 
1	stay and come with me newly married bride 
1	for if you hear him you grow like the rest 
1	bear children cook and bend above the churn 
1	and wrangle over butter fowl and eggs 
1	until at last grown old and bitter of tongue 
1	you re crouching there and shivering at the grave 
1	daughter i point you out the way to heaven 
1	but i can lead you newly married bride 
1	where nobody gets old and crafty and wise 
1	where nobody gets old and godly and grave 
1	where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue 
1	and where kind tongues bring no captivity 
1	for we are but obedient to the thoughts
1	that drift into the mind at a wink of the eye 
1	by the dear name of the one crucified 
1	i bid you mary bruin come to me 
1	i keep you in the name of your own heart 
1	it is because i put away the crucifix
1	that i am nothing and my power is nothing 
1	i ll bring it here again 
1	maurteen clinging to him 
1	do not leave us 
1	o let me go before it is too late 
1	it is my sin alone that brought it all 
1	i hear them sing come newly married bride 
1	come to the woods and waters and pale lights 
1	i will go with you 
1	she is lost alas 
1	the child standing by the door 
1	but clinging mortal hope must fall from you 
1	for we who ride the winds run on the waves 
1	and dance upon the mountains are more light
1	than dewdrops on the banner of the dawn 
1	o take me with you 
1	beloved i will keep you 
1	i ve more than words i have these arms to hold you 
1	nor all the faery host do what they please 
1	shall ever make me loosen you from these arms 
1	dear face dear voice 
1	come newly married bride 
1	i always loved her world and yet and yet 
1	white bird white bird come with me little bird 
1	she calls me 
1	come with me little bird 
1	 distant dancing figures appear in the wood 
1	i can hear songs and dancing 
1	stay with me 
1	i think that i would stay and yet and yet 
1	come little bird with crest of gold 
1	mary very softly 
1	come little bird with silver feet 
1	 mary bruin dies and the child goes 
1	she is dead 
1	come from that image body and soul are gone 
1	you have thrown your arms about a drift of leaves 
1	or bole of an ash tree changed into her image 
1	thus do the spirits of evil snatch their prey 
1	almost out of the very hand of god 
1	and day by day their power is more and more 
1	and men and women leave old paths for pride
1	comes knocking with thin knuckles on the heart 
1	 the wind blows out of the gates of the day 
1	the wind blows over the lonely of heart 
1	and the lonely of heart is withered away 
1	while the faeries dance in a place apart 
1	shaking their milk white feet in a ring 
1	tossing their milk white arms in the air 
1	for they hear the wind laugh and murmur and sing
1	of a land where even the old are fair 
1	and even the wise are merry of tongue 
1	but i heard a reed of coolaney say 
1	 when the wind has laughed and murmured and sung 
1	the lonely of heart is withered away 
1	the woods of arcady are dead 
1	and over is their antique joy 
1	of old the world on dreaming fed 
1	gray truth is now her painted toy 
1	yet still she turns her restless head 
1	but o sick children of the world 
1	of all the many changing things
1	in dreary dancing past us whirled 
1	to the cracked tune that chronos sings 
1	words alone are certain good 
1	where are now the warring kings 
1	word be mockers by the rood
1	where are now the warring kings 
1	an idle word is now their glory 
1	by the stammering schoolboy said 
1	reading some entangled story 
1	the kings of the old time are fled
1	the wandering earth herself may be
1	only a sudden flaming word 
1	in clanging space a moment heard 
1	troubling the endless reverie 
1	then nowise worship dusty deeds 
1	nor seek for this is also sooth 
1	to hunger fiercely after truth 
1	lest all thy toiling only breeds
1	new dreams new dreams there is no truth
1	saving in thine own heart seek then 
1	no learning from the starry men 
1	who follow with the optic glass
1	the whirling ways of stars that pass 
1	seek then for this is also sooth 
1	no word of theirs the cold star bane
1	has cloven and rent their hearts in twain 
1	and dead is all their human truth 
1	go gather by the humming sea
1	some twisted echo harbouring shell 
1	and to its lips thy story tell 
1	and they thy comforters will be 
1	rewarding in melodious guile 
1	thy fretful words a little while 
1	till they shall singing fade in ruth 
1	and die a pearly brotherhood 
1	for words alone are certain good 
1	sing then for this is also sooth 
1	i must be gone there is a grave
1	where daffodil and lily wave 
1	and i would please the hapless faun 
1	buried under the sleepy ground 
1	with mirthful songs before the dawn 
1	his shouting days with mirth were crowned 
1	and still i dream he treads the lawn 
1	walking ghostly in the dew 
1	pierced by my glad singing through 
1	my songs of old earth s dreamy youth 
1	but ah she dreams not now dream thou 
1	for fair are poppies on the brow 
1	dream dream for this is also sooth 
1	there was a man whom sorrow named his friend 
1	and he of his high comrade sorrow dreaming 
1	went walking with slow steps along the gleaming
1	and humming sands where windy surges wend 
1	and he called loudly to the stars to bend
1	from their pale thrones and comfort him but they
1	among themselves laugh on and sing alway 
1	and then the man whom sorrow named his friend
1	cried out dim sea hear my most piteous story 
1	the sea swept on and cried her old cry still 
1	rolling along in dreams from hill to hill 
1	he fled the persecution of her glory
1	and in a far off gentle valley stopping 
1	cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening 
1	but naught they heard for they are always listening 
1	the dewdrops for the sound of their own dropping 
1	and then the man whom sorrow named his friend 
1	sought once again the shore and found a shell 
1	and thought i will my heavy story tell
1	till my own words re echoing shall send
1	their sadness through a hollow pearly heart 
1	and my own tale again for me shall sing 
1	and my own whispering words be comforting 
1	and lo my ancient burden may depart 
1	then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim 
1	but the sad dweller by the sea ways lone
1	changed all he sang to inarticulate moan
1	among her wildering whirls forgetting him 
1	 what do you make so fair and bright 
1	 i make the cloak of sorrow 
1	 o lovely to see in all men s sight
1	 shall be the cloak of sorrow 
1	 in all men s sight 
1	 what do you build with sails for flight 
1	 i build a boat for sorrow 
1	 o swift on the seas all day and night
1	 saileth the rover sorrow 
1	 all day and night 
1	 what do you weave with wool so white 
1	 i weave the shoes of sorrow 
1	 soundless shall be the footfall light
1	 in all men s ears of sorrow 
1	 sudden and light 
1	 a little indian temple in the golden age around it a garden 
1	around that the forest anashuya the young priestess kneeling
1	send peace on all the lands and flickering corn 
1	o may tranquillity walk by his elbow
1	when wandering in the forest if he love
1	no other hear and may the indolent flocks
1	be plentiful and if he love another 
1	may panthers end him hear and load our king
1	with wisdom hour by hour may we two stand 
1	when we are dead beyond the setting suns 
1	a little from the other shades apart 
1	with mingling hair and play upon one lute 
1	vijaya entering and throwing a lily at her 
1	hail hail my anashuya 
1	no be still 
1	i priestess of this temple offer up
1	prayers for the land 
1	i will wait here amrita 
1	by mighty brahma s ever rustling robe 
1	who is amrita sorrow of all sorrows 
1	another fills your mind 
1	my mother s name 
1	anashuya sings coming out of the temple 
1	 a sad sad thought went by me slowly 
1	sigh o you little stars o sigh and shake your blue apparel 
1	the sad sad thought has gone from me now wholly 
1	sing o you little stars o sing and raise your rapturous carol
1	to mighty brahma he who made you many as the sands 
1	and laid you on the gates of evening with his quiet hands 
1	vijaya i have brought my evening rice 
1	the sun has laid his chin on the gray wood 
1	weary with all his poppies gathered round him 
1	the hour when kama full of sleepy laughter 
1	rises and showers abroad his fragrant arrows 
1	piercing the twilight with their murmuring barbs 
1	see how the sacred old flamingoes come 
1	painting with shadow all the marble steps 
1	aged and wise they seek their wonted perches
1	within the temple devious walking made
1	to wander by their melancholy minds 
1	yon tall one eyes my supper swiftly chase him
1	far far away i named him after you 
1	he is a famous fisher hour by hour
1	he ruffles with his bill the minnowed streams 
1	ah there he snaps my rice i told you so 
1	now cuff him off he s off a kiss for you 
1	because you saved my rice have you no thanks 
1	 sing you of her o first few stars 
1	whom brahma touching with his finger praises for you hold 
1	 the van of wandering quiet ere you be too calm and old 
1	sing turning in your cars 
1	what know the pilots of the stars of tears 
1	their faces are all worn and in their eyes
1	flashes the fire of sadness for they see
1	the icicles that famish all the north 
1	where men lie frozen in the glimmering snow 
1	and in the flaming forests cower the lion
1	and lioness with all their whimpering cubs 
1	and ever pacing on the verge of things 
1	the phantom beauty in a mist of tears 
1	while we alone have round us woven woods 
1	and feel the softness of each other s hand 
1	anashuya going away from him 
1	ah me you love another 
1	and may some dreadful ill befall her quick 
1	i loved another now i love no other 
1	among the mouldering of ancient woods
1	you live and on the village border she 
1	with her old father the blind wood cutter 
1	i saw her standing in her door but now 
1	vijaya swear to love her never more 
1	swear by the parents of the gods 
1	dread oath who dwell on sacred himalay 
1	on the far golden peak enormous shapes 
1	who still were old when the great sea was young
1	on their vast faces mystery and dreams 
1	their hair along the mountains rolled and filled
1	from year to year by the unnumbered nests
1	of aweless birds and round their stirless feet
1	the joyous flocks of deer and antelope 
1	who never hear the unforgiving hound 
1	by the parents of the gods i swear 
1	anashuya sings 
1	 i have forgiven o new star 
1	maybe you have not heard of us you have come forth so newly 
1	you hunter of the fields afar 
1	ah you will know my loved one by his hunter s arrows truly 
1	shoot on him shafts of quietness that he may ever keep
1	an inner laughter and may kiss his hands to me in sleep 
1	farewell vijaya nay no word no word 
1	i priestess of this temple offer up
1	prayers for the land 
1	o brahma guard in sleep
1	the merry lambs and the complacent kine 
1	the flies below the leaves and the young mice
1	in the tree roots and all the sacred flocks
1	of red flamingo and my love vijaya 
1	and may no restless fay with fidget finger
1	trouble his sleeping give him dreams of me 
1	i passed along the water s edge below the humid trees 
1	my spirit rocked in evening light the rushes round my knees 
1	my spirit rocked in sleep and sighs and saw the moorfowl pace
1	all dripping on a grassy slope and saw them cease to chase
1	each other round in circles and heard the eldest speak 
1	 who holds the world between his bill and made us strong or weak
1	is an undying moorfowl and he lives beyond the sky 
1	 who made the world and ruleth it he hangeth on a stalk 
1	 for i am in his image made and all this tinkling tide
1	is but a sliding drop of rain between his petals wide 
1	a little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes
1	brimful of starlight and he said the stamper of the skies 
1	he is a gentle roebuck for how else i pray could he
1	conceive a thing so sad and soft a gentle thing like me 
1	i passed a little further on and heard a peacock say 
1	 who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay 
1	he is a monstrous peacock and he waveth all the night
1	his languid tail above us lit with myriad spots of light 
1	the island dreams under the dawn
1	and great boughs drop tranquillity 
1	the peahens dance on a smooth lawn 
1	a parrot sways upon a tree 
1	raging at his own image in the enamelled sea 
1	here we will moor our lonely ship
1	and wander ever with woven hands 
1	murmuring softly lip to lip 
1	along the grass along the sands 
1	murmuring how far away are the unquiet lands 
1	how we alone of mortals are
1	hid under quiet bows apart 
1	while our love grows an indian star 
1	a meteor of the burning heart 
1	one with the tide that gleams the wings that gleam and dart 
1	the heavy boughs the burnished dove
1	that moans and sighs a hundred days 
1	how when we die our shades will rove 
1	when eve has hushed the feathered ways 
1	with vapoury footsole among the water s drowsy blaze 
1	autumn is over the long leaves that love us 
1	and over the mice in the barley sheaves 
1	yellow the leaves of the rowan above us 
1	and yellow the wet wild strawberry leaves 
1	the hour of the waning of love has beset us 
1	and weary and worn are our sad souls now 
1	let us part ere the season of passion forget us 
1	with a kiss and a tear on thy drooping brow 
1	 your eyes that once were never weary of mine
1	 are bowed in sorrow under pendulous lids 
1	 because our love is waning 
1	and then she 
1	 although our love is waning let us stand
1	 by the lone border of the lake once more 
1	 together in that hour of gentleness
1	 when the poor tired child passion falls asleep 
1	 how far away the stars seem and how far
1	 is our first kiss and ah how old my heart 
1	pensive they paced along the faded leaves 
1	while slowly he whose hand held hers replied 
1	 passion has often worn our wandering hearts 
1	the woods were round them and the yellow leaves
1	fell like faint meteors in the gloom and once
1	a rabbit old and lame limped down the path 
1	autumn was over him and now they stood
1	on the lone border of the lake once more 
1	turning he saw that she had thrust dead leaves
1	gathered in silence dewy as her eyes 
1	in bosom and hair 
1	 ah do not mourn he said 
1	 that we are tired for other loves await us 
1	 hate on and love through unrepining hours 
1	 before us lies eternity our souls
1	 are love and a continual farewell 
1	i sat on cushioned otter skin 
1	my word was law from ith to emen 
1	and shook at invar amargin
1	the hearts of the world troubling seamen 
1	and drove tumult and war away
1	from girl and boy and man and beast 
1	the fields grew fatter day by day 
1	the wild fowl of the air increased 
1	and every ancient ollave said 
1	while he bent down his fading head 
1	 he drives away the northern cold 
1	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
1	the beech leaves old 
1	i sat and mused and drank sweet wine 
1	a herdsman came from inland valleys 
1	crying the pirates drove his swine
1	to fill their dark beaked hollow galleys 
1	i called my battle breaking men 
1	and my loud brazen battle cars
1	from rolling vale and rivery glen 
1	and under the blinking of the stars
1	fell on the pirates by the deep 
1	and hurled them in the gulph of sleep 
1	these hands won many a torque of gold 
1	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
1	the beech leaves old 
1	but slowly as i shouting slew
1	and trampled in the bubbling mire 
1	in my most secret spirit grew
1	a whirling and a wandering fire 
1	i stood keen stars above me shone 
1	around me shone keen eyes of men 
1	i laughed aloud and hurried on
1	by rocky shore and rushy fen 
1	i laughed because birds fluttered by 
1	and starlight gleamed and clouds flew high 
1	and rushes waved and waters rolled 
1	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
1	the beech leaves old 
1	and now i wander in the woods
1	when summer gluts the golden bees 
1	or in autumnal solitudes
1	arise the leopard coloured trees 
1	or when along the wintry strands
1	the cormorants shiver on their rocks 
1	i wander on and wave my hands 
1	and sing and shake my heavy locks 
1	the gray wolf knows me by one ear
1	i lead along the woodland deer 
1	the hares run by me growing bold 
1	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
1	the beech leaves old 
1	i came upon a little town 
1	that slumbered in the harvest moon 
1	and passed a tiptoe up and down 
1	murmuring to a fitful tune 
1	how i have followed night and day 
1	a tramping of tremendous feet 
1	and saw where this old tympan lay 
1	deserted on a doorway seat 
1	and bore it to the woods with me 
1	of some unhuman misery
1	our married voiced wildly trolled 
1	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
1	the beech leaves old 
1	i sang how when day s toil is done 
1	orchil shakes out her long dark hair
1	that hides away the dying sun
1	and sheds faint odours through the air 
1	when my hand passed from wire to wire
1	it quenched with sound like falling dew 
1	the whirling and the wandering fire 
1	but lift a mournful ulalu 
1	for the kind wires are torn and still 
1	and i must wander wood and hill
1	through summer s heat and winter s cold 
1	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
1	the beech leaves old 
1	where dips the rocky highland
1	of sleuth wood in the lake 
1	there lies a leafy island
1	where flapping herons wake
1	the drowsy water rats 
1	there we ve hid our faery vats 
1	full of berries 
1	and of reddest stolen cherries 
1	 come away o human child 
1	to the waters and the wild
1	with a faery hand in hand 
1	for the world s more full of weeping than you can understand 
1	where the wave of moonlight glosses
1	the dim gray sands with light 
1	far off by furthest rosses
1	we foot it all the night 
1	weaving olden dances 
1	mingling hands and mingling glances
1	till the moon has taken flight 
1	to and fro we leap
1	and chase the frothy bubbles 
1	while the world is full of troubles
1	and is anxious in its sleep 
1	 come away o human child 
1	to the waters and the wild
1	with a faery hand in hand 
1	for the world s more full of weeping than you can understand 
1	where the wandering water gushes
1	from the hills above glen car 
1	in pools among the rushes
1	that scarce could bathe a star 
1	we seek for slumbering trout
1	and whispering in their ears
1	give them unquiet dreams 
1	leaning softly out
1	from ferns that drop their tears
1	over the young streams 
1	 come away o human child 
1	to the waters and the wild
1	with a faery hand in hand 
1	for the world s more full of weeping than you can understand 
1	away with us he s going 
1	the solemn eyed 
1	he ll hear no more the lowing
1	of the calves on the warm hillside
1	or the kettle on the hob
1	sing peace into his breast 
1	or see the brown mice bob
1	round and round the oatmeal chest 
1	 for he comes the human child 
1	to the waters and the wild
1	with a faery hand in hand 
1	from a world more full of weeping than he can understand 
1	shy one shy one 
1	shy one of my heart 
1	she moves in the firelight
1	pensively apart 
1	she carries in the dishes 
1	and lays them in a row 
1	to an isle in the water
1	with her would i go 
1	she carries in the candles 
1	and lights the curtained room 
1	shy in the doorway
1	and shy in the gloom 
1	and shy as a rabbit 
1	helpful and shy 
1	to an isle in the water
1	with her would i fly 
1	down by the salley gardens my love and i did meet 
1	she passed the salley gardens with little snow white feet 
1	she bid me take love easy as the leaves grow on the tree 
1	but i being young and foolish with her would not agree 
1	in a field by the river my love and i did stand 
1	and on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow white hand 
1	she bid me take life easy as the grass grows on the weirs 
1	but i was young and foolish and now am full of tears 
1	you waves though you dance by my feet like children at play 
1	though you glow and you glance though you purr and you dart 
1	the herring are not in the tides as they were of old 
1	my sorrow for many a creak gave the creel in the cart
1	that carried the take to sligo town to be sold 
1	 when i was a boy with never a crack in my heart 
1	and ah you proud maiden you are not so fair when his oar
1	is heard on the water as they were the proud and apart 
1	who paced in the eve by the nets on the pebbly shore 
1	 when i was a boy with never a crack in my heart 
1	in penal days rode out
1	to a shoneen who had free lands
1	and his own snipe and trout 
1	in trust took he john s lands 
1	sleiveens were all his race 
1	and he gave them as dowers to his daughters 
1	and they married beyond their place 
1	but father john went up 
1	and father john went down 
1	and he wore small holes in his shoes 
1	and he wore large holes in his gown 
1	all loved him only the shoneen 
1	whom the devils have by the hair 
1	from the wives and the cats and the children 
1	to the birds in the white of the air 
1	the birds for he opened their cages
1	as he went up and down 
1	and he said with a smile have peace now 
1	and he went his way with a frown 
1	but if when any one died
1	came keeners hoarser than rooks 
1	he bade them give over their keening 
1	for he was a man of books 
1	and these were the works of john 
1	when weeping score by score 
1	people came into coloony 
1	for he d died at ninety four 
1	there was no human keening 
1	the birds from knocknarea
1	and the world round knocknashee
1	came keening in that day 
1	the young birds and old birds
1	came flying heavy and sad 
1	keening in from tiraragh 
1	keening from ballinafad 
1	keening from inishmurray 
1	nor stayed for bite or sup 
1	this way were all reproved
1	who dig old customs up 
1	come round me little childer 
1	there don t fling stones at me
1	because i mutter as i go 
1	but pity moll magee 
1	my man was a poor fisher
1	with shore lines in the say 
1	my work was saltin herrings
1	the whole of the long day 
1	and sometimes from the saltin shed 
1	i scarce could drag my feet
1	under the blessed moonlight 
1	along the pebbly street 
1	i d always been but weakly 
1	and my baby was just born 
1	a neighbour minded her by day
1	i minded her till morn 
1	i lay upon my baby 
1	ye little childer dear 
1	i looked on my cold baby
1	when the morn grew frosty and clear 
1	a weary woman sleeps so hard 
1	my man grew red and pale 
1	and gave me money and bade me go
1	to my own place kinsale 
1	he drove me out and shut the door 
1	and gave his curse to me 
1	i went away in silence 
1	no neighbour could i see 
1	the windows and the doors were shut 
1	one star shone faint and green
1	the little straws were turnin round
1	across the bare boreen 
1	i went away in silence 
1	beyond old martin s byre
1	i saw a kindly neighbour
1	blowin her mornin fire 
1	she drew from me my story 
1	my money s all used up 
1	and still with pityin scornin eye 
1	she gives me bite and sup 
1	she says my man will surely come 
1	and fetch me home agin 
1	but always as i m movin round 
1	without doors or within 
1	pilin the wood or pilin the turf 
1	or goin to the well 
1	i m thinkin of my baby
1	and keenin to mysel 
1	and sometimes i am sure she knows
1	when openin wide his door 
1	god lights the stars his candles 
1	and looks upon the poor 
1	so now ye little childer 
1	ye won t fling stones at me 
1	but gather with your shinin looks
1	and pity moll magee 
1	 now lay me in a cushioned chair
1	 and carry me you four 
1	 with cushions here and cushions there 
1	 to see the world once more 
1	 and some one from the stables bring
1	 my dermot dear and brown 
1	 and lead him gently in a ring 
1	 and gently up and down 
1	 now leave the chair upon the grass 
1	 bring hound and huntsman here 
1	 and i on this strange road will pass 
1	 filled full of ancient cheer 
1	his eyelids droop his head falls low 
1	his old eyes cloud with dreams 
1	the sun upon all things that grow
1	pours round in sleepy streams 
1	brown dermot treads upon the lawn 
1	and to the armchair goes 
1	and now the old man s dreams are gone 
1	he smooths the long brown nose 
1	and now moves many a pleasant tongue
1	upon his wasted hands 
1	for leading aged hounds and young
1	the huntsman near him stands 
1	 my huntsman rody blow the horn 
1	 and make the hills reply 
1	the huntsman loosens on the morn
1	a gay and wandering cry 
1	a fire is in the old man s eyes 
1	his fingers move and sway 
1	and when the wandering music dies
1	they hear him feebly say 
1	 my huntsman rody blow the horn 
1	 and make the hills reply 
1	 i cannot blow upon my horn 
1	 i can but weep and sigh 
1	the servants round his cushioned place
1	are with new sorrow wrung 
1	and hounds are gazing on his face 
1	both aged hounds and young 
1	one blind hound only lies apart
1	on the sun smitten grass 
1	he holds deep commune with his heart 
1	the moments pass and pass 
1	the blind hound with a mournful din
1	lifts slow his wintry head 
1	the servants bear the body in 
1	the hounds wail for the dead 
1	 give me the world if thou wilt but grant me an asylum for my
1	affections 
1	you who are bent and bald and blind 
1	with a heavy heart and a wandering mind 
1	have known three centuries poets sing 
1	of dalliance with a demon thing 
1	sad to remember sick with years 
1	the swift innumerable spears 
1	the horsemen with their floating hair 
1	and bowls of barley honey and wine 
1	and feet of maidens dancing in tune 
1	and the white body that lay by mine 
1	but the tale though words be lighter than air 
1	must live to be old like the wandering moon 
1	caolte and conan and finn were there 
1	when we followed a deer with our baying hounds 
1	and passing the firbolgs burial mounds 
1	came to the cairn heaped grassy hill
1	where passionate maive is stony still 
1	and found on the dove gray edge of the sea
1	a pearl pale high born lady who rode
1	on a horse with bridle of findrinny 
1	and like a sunset were her lips 
1	a stormy sunset on doomed ships 
1	a citron colour gloomed in her hair 
1	but down to her feet white vesture flowed 
1	and with the glimmering crimson glowed
1	of many a figured embroidery 
1	and it was bound with a pearl pale shell
1	that wavered like the summer streams 
1	as her soft bosom rose and fell 
1	you are still wrecked among heathen dreams 
1	 why do you wind no horn she said 
1	 and every hero droop his head 
1	 the hornless deer is not more sad
1	 that many a peaceful moment had 
1	 more sleek than any granary mouse 
1	 in his own leafy forest house
1	 among the waving fields of fern 
1	 the hunting of heroes should be glad 
1	 o pleasant woman answered finn 
1	 we think on oscar s pencilled urn 
1	 and on the heroes lying slain 
1	on gavra s raven covered plain 
1	 but where are your noble kith and kin 
1	 and from what country do you ride 
1	 my father and my mother are
1	 aengus and adene my own name
1	 niam and my country far
1	 beyond the tumbling of this tide 
1	 what dream came with you that you came
1	 through bitter tide on foam wet feet 
1	 did your companion wander away
1	 from where the birds of aengus wing 
1	she said with laughter tender and sweet 
1	 i have not yet war weary king 
1	 been spoken of with any one 
1	 yet now i choose for these four feet
1	 ran through the foam and ran to this
1	 that i might have your son to kiss 
1	 were there no better than my son
1	 that you through all that foam should run 
1	 i loved no man though kings besought
1	 love till the danaan poets brought
1	 rhyme that rhymed to usheen s name 
1	 and now i am dizzy with the thought
1	 of all that wisdom and the fame
1	 of battles broken by his hands 
1	 of stories builded by his words
1	 that are like coloured asian birds
1	 at evening in their rainless lands 
1	o patric by your brazen bell 
1	there was no limb of mine but fell
1	into a desperate gulph of love 
1	 you only will i wed i cried 
1	 and i will make a thousand songs 
1	 and set your name all names above 
1	 and captives bound with leathern thongs
1	 shall kneel and praise you one by one 
1	 at evening in my western dun 
1	 o usheen mount by me and ride
1	 to shores by the wash of the tremulous tide 
1	 where men have heaped no burial mounds 
1	 and the days pass by like a wayward tune 
1	 where broken faith has never been known 
1	 and the blushes of first love never have flown 
1	 and there i will give you a hundred hounds 
1	 no mightier creatures bay at the moon 
1	 and a hundred robes of murmuring silk 
1	 and a hundred calves and a hundred sheep
1	 whose long wool whiter than sea froth flows 
1	 and a hundred spears and a hundred bows 
1	 and oil and wine and honey and milk 
1	 and always never anxious sleep 
1	 while a hundred youths mighty of limb 
1	 but knowing nor tumult nor hate nor strife 
1	 and a hundred maidens merry as birds 
1	 who when they dance to a fitful measure
1	 have a speed like the speed of the salmon herds 
1	 shall follow your horn and obey your whim 
1	 and you shall know the danaan leisure 
1	 and niam be with you for a wife 
1	then she sighed gently it grows late 
1	 music and love and sleep await 
1	 where i would be when the white moon climbs
1	 the red sun falls and the world grows dim 
1	and then i mounted and she bound me
1	with her triumphing arms around me 
1	and whispering to herself enwound me 
1	but when the horse had felt my weight 
1	he shook himself and neighed three times 
1	caolte conan and finn came near 
1	and wept and raised their lamenting hands 
1	and bid me stay with many a tear 
1	but we rode out from the human lands 
1	in what far kingdom do you go 
1	ah fenians with the shield and bow 
1	or are you phantoms white as snow 
1	whose lips had life s most prosperous glow 
1	o you with whom in sloping valleys 
1	or down the dewy forest alleys 
1	i chased at morn the flying deer 
1	with whom i hurled the hurrying spear 
1	and heard the foemen s bucklers rattle 
1	and broke the heaving ranks of battle 
1	where are you with your long rough hair 
1	you go not where the red deer feeds 
1	nor tear the foemen from their steeds 
1	boast not nor mourn with drooping head
1	companions long accurst and dead 
1	and hounds for centuries dust and air 
1	we galloped over the glossy sea 
1	i know not if days passed or hours 
1	and niam sang continually
1	danaan songs and their dewy showers
1	of pensive laughter unhuman sound 
1	lulled weariness and softly round
1	my human sorrow her white arms wound 
1	we galloped now a hornless deer
1	passed by us chased by a phantom hound
1	all pearly white save one red ear 
1	and now a maiden rode like the wind
1	with an apple of gold in her tossing hand 
1	and a beautiful young man followed behind
1	with quenchless gaze and fluttering hair 
1	 were these two born in the danaan land 
1	 or have they breathed the mortal air 
1	 vex them no longer niam said 
1	and sighing bowed her gentle head 
1	and sighing laid the pearly tip
1	of one long finger on my lip 
1	but now the moon like a white rose shone
1	in the pale west and the sun s rim sank 
1	and clouds arrayed their rank on rank
1	about his fading crimson ball 
1	the floor of emen s hosting hall
1	was not more level than the sea 
1	as full of loving phantasy 
1	and with low murmurs we rode on 
1	where many a trumpet twisted shell
1	that in immortal silence sleeps
1	dreaming of her own melting hues 
1	her golds her ambers and her blues 
1	pierced with soft light the shallowing deeps 
1	but now a wandering land breeze came
1	and a far sound of feathery quires 
1	it seemed to blow from the dying flame 
1	they seemed to sing in the smouldering fires 
1	the horse towards the music raced 
1	neighing along the lifeless waste 
1	like sooty fingers many a tree
1	rose ever out of the warm sea 
1	and they were trembling ceaselessly 
1	as though they all were beating time 
1	upon the centre of the sun 
1	to that low laughing woodland rhyme 
1	and now our wandering hours were done 
1	we cantered to the shore and knew
1	the reason of the trembling trees 
1	round every branch the song birds flew 
1	or clung thereon like swarming bees 
1	while round the shore a million stood
1	like drops of frozen rainbow light 
1	and pondered in a soft vain mood
1	upon their shadows in the tide 
1	and told the purple deeps their pride 
1	and murmured snatches of delight 
1	and on the shores were many boats
1	with bending sterns and bending bows 
1	and carven figures on their prows
1	of bitterns and fish eating stoats 
1	and swans with their exultant throats 
1	and where the wood and waters meet
1	we tied the horse in a leafy clump 
1	and niam blew three merry notes
1	out of a little silver trump 
1	and then an answering whispering flew
1	over the bare and woody land 
1	a whisper of impetuous feet 
1	and ever nearer nearer grew 
1	and from the woods rushed out a band
1	of men and maidens hand in hand 
1	and singing singing altogether 
1	their brows were white as fragrant milk 
1	their cloaks made out of yellow silk 
1	and trimmed with many a crimson feather 
1	and when they saw the cloak i wore
1	was dim with mire of a mortal shore 
1	they fingered it and gazed on me
1	and laughed like murmurs of the sea 
1	but niam with a swift distress
1	bid them away and hold their peace 
1	and when they heard her voice they ran
1	and knelt them every maid and man
1	and kissed as they would never cease 
1	her pearl pale hand and the hem of her dress 
1	she bade them bring us to the hall
1	where aengus dreams from sun to sun 
1	a druid dream of the end of days
1	when the stars are to wane and the world be done 
1	they led us by long and shadowy ways
1	where drops of dew in myriads fall 
1	and tangled creepers every hour
1	blossom in some new crimson flower 
1	and once a sudden laughter sprang
1	from all their lips and once they sang
1	together while the dark woods rang 
1	and made in all their distant parts 
1	with boom of bees in honey marts 
1	a rumour of delighted hearts 
1	and once a maiden by my side
1	gave me a harp and bid me sing 
1	and touch the laughing silver string 
1	but when i sang of human joy
1	a sorrow wrapped each merry face 
1	and patric by your beard they wept 
1	until one came a tearful boy 
1	 a sadder creature never stept
1	 than this strange human bard he cried 
1	and caught the silver harp away 
1	and weeping over the white strings hurled
1	it down in a leaf hid hollow place
1	that kept dim waters from the sky 
1	and each one said with a long long sigh 
1	 o saddest harp in all the world 
1	 sleep there till the moon and the stars die 
1	and now still sad we came to where
1	a beautiful young man dreamed within
1	a house of wattles clay and skin 
1	one hand upheld his beardless chin 
1	and one a sceptre flashing out
1	wild flames of red and gold and blue 
1	like to a merry wandering rout
1	of dancers leaping in the air 
1	and men and maidens knelt them there
1	and showed their eyes with teardrops dim 
1	and with low murmurs prayed to him 
1	and kissed the sceptre with red lips 
1	and touched it with their finger tips 
1	he held that flashing sceptre up 
1	 joy drowns the twilight in the dew 
1	 and fills with stars night s purple cup 
1	 and wakes the sluggard seeds of corn 
1	 and stirs the young kid s budding horn 
1	 and makes the infant ferns unwrap 
1	 and for the peewit paints his cap 
1	 and rolls along the unwieldy sun 
1	 and makes the little planets run 
1	 and if joy were not on the earth 
1	 there were an end of change and birth 
1	 and earth and heaven and hell would die 
1	 and in some gloomy barrow lie
1	 folded like a frozen fly 
1	 then mock at death and time with glances
1	 and wavering arms and wandering dances 
1	 men s hearts of old were drops of flame
1	 that from the saffron morning came 
1	 or drops of silver joy that fell
1	 out of the moon s pale twisted shell 
1	 but now hearts cry that hearts are slaves 
1	 and toss and turn in narrow caves 
1	 but here there is nor law nor rule 
1	 nor have hands held a weary tool 
1	 and here there is nor change nor death 
1	 but only kind and merry breath 
1	 for joy is god and god is joy 
1	with one long glance on maid and boy
1	and the pale blossom of the moon 
1	he fell into a druid swoon 
1	and in a wild and sudden dance
1	we mocked at time and fate and chance
1	and swept out of the wattled hall
1	and came to where the dewdrops fall
1	among the foamdrops of the sea 
1	and there we hushed the revelry 
1	and gathering on our brows a frown 
1	bent all our swaying bodies down 
1	and to the waves that glimmer by
1	that sloping green de danaan sod
1	 and things that have grown sad are wicked 
1	 and things that fear the dawn of the morrow
1	 or the gray wandering osprey sorrow 
1	we danced to where in the winding thicket
1	the damask roses bloom on bloom 
1	like crimson meteors hang in the gloom 
1	and bending over them softly said 
1	bending over them in the dance 
1	with a swift and friendly glance
1	from dewy eyes upon the dead
1	 fall the leaves of other roses 
1	 on the dead dim earth encloses 
1	 but never never on our graves 
1	 heaped beside the glimmering waves 
1	 shall fall the leaves of damask roses 
1	 for neither death nor change comes near us 
1	 and all listless hours fear us 
1	 and we fear no dawning morrow 
1	 nor the gray wandering osprey sorrow 
1	the dance wound through the windless woods 
1	the ever summered solitudes 
1	until the tossing arms grew still
1	upon the woody central hill 
1	and gathered in a panting band 
1	we flung on high each waving hand 
1	and sang unto the starry broods 
1	in our raised eyes there flashed a glow
1	of milky brightness to and fro
1	as thus our song arose you stars 
1	 across your wandering ruby cars
1	 shake the loose reins you slaves of god
1	 he rules you with an iron rod 
1	 he holds you with an iron bond 
1	 each one woven to the other 
1	 each one woven to his brother
1	 like bubbles in a frozen pond 
1	 but we in a lonely land abide
1	 unchainable as the dim tide 
1	 with hearts that know nor law nor rule 
1	 and hands that hold no wearisome tool
1	 folded in love that fears no morrow 
1	 nor the gray wandering osprey sorrow 
1	o patric for a hundred years
1	i chased upon that woody shore
1	the deer the badger and the boar 
1	o patric for a hundred years
1	at evening on the glimmering sands 
1	beside the piled up hunting spears 
1	these now outworn and withered hands
1	wrestled among the island bands 
1	o patric for a hundred years
1	we went a fishing in long boats
1	with bending sterns and bending bows 
1	and carven figures on their prows
1	of bitterns and fish eating stoats 
1	o patric for a hundred years
1	the gentle niam was my wife 
1	but now two things devour my life 
1	the things that most of all i hate 
1	fasting and prayers 
1	yes yes 
1	for these were ancient usheen s fate
1	loosed long ago from heaven s gate 
1	for his last days to lie in wait 
1	when one day by the tide i stood 
1	i found in that forgetfulness
1	of dreamy foam a staff of wood
1	from some dead warrior s broken lance 
1	i turned it in my hands the stains
1	of war were on it and i wept 
1	remembering how the fenians stept
1	along the blood bedabbled plains 
1	equal to good or grievous chance 
1	thereon young niam softly came
1	and caught my hands but spake no word
1	save only many times my name 
1	in murmurs like a frighted bird 
1	we passed by woods and lawns of clover 
1	and found the horse and bridled him 
1	for we knew well the old was over 
1	i heard one say his eyes grow dim
1	 with all the ancient sorrow of men 
1	and wrapped in dreams rode out again
1	with hoofs of the pale findrinny
1	over the glimmering purple sea 
1	under the golden evening light 
1	the immortals moved among the fountains
1	by rivers and the woods old night 
1	some danced like shadows on the mountains 
1	some wandered ever hand in hand 
1	or sat in dreams on the pale strand 
1	each forehead like an obscure star
1	bent down above each hooked knee 
1	and sang and with a dreamy gaze
1	watched where the sun in a saffron blaze
1	was slumbering half in the sea ways 
1	and as they sang the painted birds
1	kept time with their bright wings and feet 
1	like drops of honey came their words 
1	but fainter than a young lamb s bleat 
1	 an old man stirs the fire to a blaze 
1	 in the house of a child of a friend of a brother
1	 he has over lingered his welcome the days 
1	 grown desolate whisper and sigh to each other 
1	 he hears the storm in the chimney above 
1	 and bends to the fire and shakes with the cold 
1	 while his heart still dreams of battle and love 
1	 and the cry of the hounds on the hills of old 
1	 but we are apart in the grassy places 
1	 where care cannot trouble the least of our days 
1	 or the softness of youth be gone from our faces 
1	 or love s first tenderness die in our gaze 
1	 the hare grows old as she plays in the sun
1	 and gazes around her with eyes of brightness 
1	 before the swift things that she dreamed of were done
1	 she limps along in an aged whiteness 
1	 a storm of birds in the asian trees
1	 like tulips in the air a winging 
1	 and the gentle waves of the summer seas 
1	 that raise their heads and wander singing 
1	 must murmur at last unjust unjust 
1	 and my speed is a weariness falters the mouse
1	 and the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust 
1	 and the roof falls in of his tunnelled house 
1	 but the love dew dims our eyes till the day
1	 when god shall come from the sea with a sigh
1	 and bid the stars drop down from the sky 
1	 and the moon like a pale rose wither away 
1	now man of croziers shadows called our names
1	and then away away like whirling flames 
1	and now fled by mist covered without sound 
1	the youth and lady and the deer and hound 
1	 gaze no more on the phantoms niam said 
1	and kissed my eyes and swaying her bright head
1	and her bright body sang of faery and man
1	before god was or my old line began 
1	wars shadowy vast exultant faeries of old
1	who wedded men with rings of druid gold 
1	and how those lovers never turn their eyes
1	upon the life that fades and flickers and dies 
1	but love and kiss on dim shores far away
1	rolled round with music of the sighing spray 
1	but sang no more as when like a brown bee
1	that has drunk full she crossed the misty sea
1	with me in her white arms a hundred years
1	before this day for now the fall of tears
1	troubled her song 
1	i do not know if days
1	or hours passed by yet hold the morning rays
1	shone many times among the glimmering flowers
1	woven into her hair before dark towers
1	rose in the darkness and the white surf gleamed
1	about them and the horse of faery screamed
1	and shivered knowing the isle of many fears 
1	nor ceased until white niam stroked his ears
1	and named him by sweet names 
1	a foaming tide
1	whitened afar with surge fan formed and wide 
1	burst from a great door marred by many a blow
1	from mace and sword and pole axe long ago
1	when gods and giants warred we rode between
1	the seaweed covered pillars and the green
1	and surging phosphorus alone gave light
1	on our dark pathway till a countless flight
1	of moonlit steps glimmered and left and right
1	dark statues glimmered over the pale tide
1	upon dark thrones between the lids of one
1	the imaged meteors had flashed and run
1	and had disported in the stilly jet 
1	and the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set 
1	since god made time and death and sleep the other
1	stretched his long arm to where a misty smother 
1	the stream churned churned and churned his lips apart 
1	as though he told his never slumbering heart
1	of every foamdrop on its misty way 
1	tying the horse to his vast foot that lay
1	half in the unvesselled sea we climbed the stairs
1	and climbed so long i thought the last steps were
1	hung from the morning star when these mild words
1	fanned the delighted air like wings of birds 
1	 my brothers spring out of their beds at morn 
1	 a murmur like young partridge with loud horn
1	 they chase the noontide deer 
1	 and when the dew drowned stars hang in the air
1	 look to long fishing lines or point and pare
1	 an ash wood hunting spear 
1	 o sigh o fluttering sigh be kind to me 
1	 flutter along the froth lips of the sea 
1	 and shores the froth lips wet 
1	 and stay a little while and bid them weep 
1	 ah touch their blue veined eyelids if they sleep 
1	 and shake their coverlet 
1	 when you have told how i weep endlessly 
1	 flutter along the froth lips of the sea
1	 and home to me again 
1	 and in the shadow of my hair lie hid 
1	 and tell me how you came to one unbid 
1	 the saddest of all men 
1	a maiden with soft eyes like funeral tapers 
1	and face that seemed wrought out of moonlit vapours 
1	and a sad mouth that fear made tremulous
1	as any ruddy moth looked down on us 
1	and she with a wave rusted chain was tied
1	to two old eagles full of ancient pride 
1	that with dim eyeballs stood on either side 
1	few feathers were on their dishevelled wings 
1	for their dim minds were with the ancient things 
1	 i bring deliverance pearl pale niam said 
1	 neither the living nor the unlabouring dead 
1	 nor the high gods who never lived may fight
1	 my enemy and hope demons for fright
1	 jabber and scream about him in the night 
1	 for he is strong and crafty as the seas
1	 that sprang under the seven hazel trees 
1	 and i must needs endure and hate and weep 
1	 until the gods and demons drop asleep 
1	 hearing aed touch the mournful strings of gold 
1	 is he so dreadful 
1	 be not over bold 
1	 but flee while you may flee from him 
1	 this demon shall be pierced and drop and die 
1	 and his loose bulk be thrown in the loud tide 
1	 flee from him pearl pale niam weeping cried 
1	 for all men flee the demons but moved not
1	my angry king remembering soul one jot 
1	there was no mightier soul of heber s line 
1	now it is old and mouse like for a sign
1	i burst the chain still earless nerveless blind 
1	wrapped in the things of the unhuman mind 
1	in some dim memory or ancient mood
1	still earless nerveless blind the eagles stood 
1	and then we climbed the stair to a high door 
1	a hundred horsemen on the basalt floor
1	beneath had paced content we held our way
1	and stood within clothed in a misty ray
1	i saw a foam white seagull drift and float
1	under the roof and with a straining throat
1	shouted and hailed him he hung there a star 
1	for no man s cry shall ever mount so far 
1	not even your god could have thrown down that hall 
1	stabling his unloosed lightnings in their stall 
1	he had sat down and sighed with cumbered heart 
1	as though his hour were come 
1	we sought the part
1	that was most distant from the door green slime
1	made the way slippery and time on time
1	showed prints of sea born scales while down through it
1	the captive s journeys to and fro were writ
1	like a small river and where feet touched came
1	a momentary gleam of phosphorus flame 
1	under the deepest shadows of the hall
1	that maiden found a ring hung on the wall 
1	and in the ring a torch and with its flare
1	making a world about her in the air 
1	passed under a dim doorway out of sight
1	and came again holding a second light
1	burning between her fingers and in mine
1	laid it and sighed i held a sword whose shine
1	no centuries could dim and a word ran
1	thereon in ogham letters mananan 
1	that sea god s name who in a deep content
1	sprang dripping and with captive demons sent
1	out of the seven fold seas built the dark hall
1	rooted in foam and clouds and cried to all
1	the mightier masters of a mightier race 
1	and at his cry there came no milk pale face
1	under a crown of thorns and dark with blood 
1	but only exultant faces 
1	niam stood
1	with bowed head trembling when the white blade shone 
1	but she whose hours of tenderness were gone
1	had neither hope nor fear i bade them hide
1	under the shadows till the tumults died
1	of the loud crashing and earth shaking fight 
1	lest they should look upon some dreadful sight 
1	and thrust the torch between the slimy flags 
1	a dome made out of endless carven jags 
1	where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face 
1	looked down on me and in the self same place
1	i waited hour by hour and the high dome 
1	windowless pillarless multitudinous home
1	of faces waited and the leisured gaze
1	was loaded with the memory of days
1	buried and mighty when through the great door
1	the dawn came in and glimmered on the floor
1	with a pale light i journeyed round the hall
1	and found a door deep sunken in the wall 
1	the least of doors beyond on a dim plain
1	a little runnel made a bubbling strain 
1	and on the runnel s stony and bare edge
1	a husky demon dry as a withered sedge
1	swayed crooning to himself an unknown tongue 
1	in a sad revelry he sang and swung
1	bacchant and mournful passing to and fro
1	his hand along the runnel s side as though
1	the flowers still grew there far on the sea s waste
1	shaking and waving vapour vapour chased 
1	while high frail cloudlets fed with a green light 
1	like drifts of leaves immovable and bright 
1	hung in the passionate dawn he slowly turned 
1	a demon s leisure eyes first white now burned
1	like wings of kingfishers and he arose
1	barking we trampled up and down with blows
1	of sword and brazen battle axe while day
1	gave to high noon and noon to night gave way 
1	and when at withering of the sun he knew
1	the druid sword of mananan he grew
1	to many shapes i lunged at the smooth throat
1	of a great eel it changed and i but smote
1	a fir tree roaring in its leafless top 
1	i held a dripping corpse with livid chop
1	and sunken shape against my face and breast 
1	when i tore down the tree but when the west
1	surged up in plumy fire i lunged and drave
1	through heart and spine and cast him in the wave 
1	lest niam shudder 
1	full of hope and dread
1	those two came carrying wine and meat and bread 
1	and healed my wounds with unguents out of flowers
1	that feed white moths by some de danaan shrine 
1	then in that hall lit by the dim sea shine 
1	we lay on skins of otters and drank wine 
1	brewed by the sea gods from huge cups that lay
1	upon the lips of sea gods in their day 
1	and then on heaped up skins of otters slept 
1	but when the sun once more in saffron stept 
1	rolling his flagrant wheel out of the deep 
1	we sang the loves and angers without sleep 
1	and all the exultant labours of the strong 
1	but now the lying clerics murder song
1	with barren words and flatteries of the weak 
1	in what land do the powerless turn the beak
1	of ravening sorrow or the hand of wrath 
1	for all your croziers they have left the path
1	and wander in the storms and clinging snows 
1	hopeless for ever ancient usheen knows 
1	for he is weak and poor and blind and lies
1	on the anvil of the world 
1	be still the skies
1	are choked with thunder lightning and fierce wind 
1	for god has heard and speaks his angry mind 
1	go cast your body on the stones and pray 
1	for he has wrought midnight and dawn and day 
1	saint do you weep i hear amid the thunder
1	the fenian horses armour torn asunder 
1	laughter and cries the armies clash and shock 
1	all is done now i see the ravens flock 
1	ah cease you mournful laughing fenian horn 
1	we feasted for three days on the fourth morn
1	i found dropping sea foam on the wide stair 
1	and hung with slime and whispering in his hair 
1	that demon dull and unsubduable 
1	and once more to a day long battle fell 
1	and at the sundown threw him in the surge 
1	to lie until the fourth morn saw emerge
1	his new healed shape and for a hundred years
1	so warred so feasted with nor dreams nor fears 
1	nor languor nor fatigue and endless feast 
1	an endless war 
1	the hundred years had ceased 
1	i stood upon the stair the surges bore
1	a beech bough to me and my heart grew sore 
1	remembering how i had stood by white haired finn
1	under a beech at emen and heard the thin
1	outcry of bats 
1	and then young niam came
1	holding that horse and sadly called my name 
1	i mounted and we passed over the lone
1	and drifting grayness while this monotone 
1	surly and distant mixed inseparably
1	into the clangour of the wind and sea 
1	 i hear my soul drop down into decay 
1	 and mananan s dark tower stone by stone 
1	 gather sea slime and fall the seaward way 
1	 and the moon goad the waters night and day 
1	 that all be overthrown 
1	 but till the moon has taken all i wage
1	 war on the mightiest men under the skies 
1	 and they have fallen or fled age after age 
1	 light is man s love and lighter is man s rage 
1	 his purpose drifts and dies 
1	and then lost niam murmured love we go
1	 are empty of all power 
1	 and which of these
1	 none know she said 
1	and on my bosom laid her weeping head 
1	foam pale distance broke 
1	i mused on the chase with the fenians and bran sgeolan lomair 
1	came now the sliding of tears and sweeping of mist cold hair 
1	and now the warmth of sighs and after the quiver of lips 
1	and we stood on a sea s edge we saw not for whiter
1	than new washed fleece
1	and we rode on the plains of the sea s edge the sea s edge
1	barren and gray 
1	for no live creatures lived there no weasels moved in the dark 
1	long sighs arose in our spirits beneath us bubbled the ground 
1	and the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow night 
1	for as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams
1	of the world and the sun 
1	till the horse gave a whinny for cumbrous with stems
1	of the hazel and oak 
1	their naked and gleaming bodies poured out and heaped in the way 
1	and by them were arrow and war axe arrow and shield and blade 
1	the claws of birds 
1	grown whiter than curds 
1	his dew cumbered skies 
1	so long were they sleeping the owls had builded their nests
1	in their locks 
1	filling the fibrous dimness with long generations of eyes 
1	and the chief of the huge white creatures his knees
1	in the soft star flame 
1	lay loose in a place of shadow we drew the reins by his side 
1	and my gaze was thronged with the sleepers no 
1	not since the world began 
1	and i gazed on the bell branch sleep s forebear 
1	far sung by the sennachies 
1	snatching the horn of niam i blew a lingering note 
1	came sound from those monstrous sleepers a sound like
1	the stirring of flies 
1	i cried come out of the shadow king of the nails of gold 
1	half open his eyes were and held me dull with
1	the smoke of their dreams 
1	his lips moved slowly in answer no answer out of them came 
1	then he swayed in his fingers the bell branch slow dropping
1	a sound in faint streams
1	of the whole of my mirth 
1	in the roots of the grasses the sorrels i laid my body as low 
1	and man of the many white croziers a century there i forgot 
1	how the fetlocks drip blood in the battle when
1	the fallen on fallen lie rolled 
1	and man of the many white croziers a century there i forgot 
1	that the spear shaft is made out of ashwood the shield
1	out of ozier and hide 
1	but in dreams mild man of the croziers driving the dust
1	with their throngs 
1	moved round me of seamen or landsmen all who are winter tales 
1	came by me the kings of the red branch with roaring
1	of laughter and songs 
1	or moved as they moved once love making or piercing
1	the tempest with sails 
1	on his beard never dry 
1	dark balor as old as a forest car borne his mighty head sunk
1	helpless men lifting the lids of his weary and death making eye 
1	so lived i and lived not so wrought i and wrought not 
1	with creatures of dreams 
1	they love going by 
1	when a glow worm was green on a grass leaf lured from
1	his lair in the mould 
1	white as a shell 
1	that once more moved in my bosom the ancient sadness of man 
1	and that i would leave the immortals their dimness 
1	their dews dropping sleep 
1	i cried o niam o white one if only a twelve houred day 
1	 like me were some galley forsaken far off in meridian isle 
1	 remembering its long oared companions sails turning
1	to thread bare rags 
1	 no more to crawl on the seas with long oars mile after mile 
1	bell branch is naught 
1	 but weep for your niam o usheen weep for if only your shoe
1	 brush lightly as haymouse earth s pebbles you will come
1	no more to my side 
1	 o flaming lion of the world o when will you turn to your rest 
1	 i would die like a small withered leaf in the autumn 
1	for breast unto breast
1	 in the isles of the farthest seas where only the spirits come 
1	 were the winds less soft than the breath of a pigeon
1	who sleeps on her nest 
1	in a reverie forgetful of all things over the bubbling ground 
1	when they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast 
1	till fattening the winds of the morning an odour of new mown hay
1	if i were as i once was the strong hoofs crushing
1	the sand and the shells 
1	making way from the kindling surges i rode on a bridle path
1	or weeding or ploughing with faces a shining with much toil wet 
1	while in this place and that place with bodies unglorious 
1	their chieftains stood 
1	of wind in a wood 
1	wolves in the night 
1	so sleep thee by daytime a voice cried the fenians
1	a long time are dead 
1	a whitebeard stood hushed on the pathway the flesh
1	of his face as dried grass 
1	and in folds round his eyes and his mouth he sad
1	as a child without milk 
1	and the dreams of the islands were gone and i knew how
1	men sorrow and pass 
1	and their hound and their horse and their love and their eyes
1	that glimmer like silk 
1	 where white clouds lie spread
1	 on crevroe or broad knockfefin with many of old they feast
1	 on the floors of the gods he cried no the gods
1	a long time are dead 
1	and lonely and longing for niam i shivered and turned me about 
1	with their burden at length 
1	leaning down from the gem studded saddle i flung it
1	five yards with my hand 
1	and my years three hundred fell on me and i rose 
1	and walked on the earth 
1	a creeping old man full of sleep with the spittle
1	on his beard never dry 
1	the crozier gleams 
1	what place have caolte and conan and bran sgeolan lomair 
1	speak you too are old with your memories an old man surrounded
1	with dreams 
1	where the flesh of the footsole clingeth on the burning stones
1	is their place 
1	armed guest 
1	and turn to our rest 
1	in their rage

1	le lendemain quand on sut qu il existait deux opulents etrangers

1	the light beats down the gates of pearl are wide 
1	and she is passing to the floor of peace 
1	and mary of the seven times wounded heart

2	for me an audience interminable 
2	with firm and regular step they wend they never stop 
2	successions of men americanos a hundred millions 
2	one generation playing its part and passing on 
2	another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn 
2	with faces turn d sideways or backward towards me to listen 
2	with eyes retrospective towards me

2	take my leaves america take them south and take them north 
2	and you precedents connect lovingly with them for they connect
2	lovingly with you 
2	i conn d old times 
2	i sat studying at the feet of the great masters 
2	in the name of these states shall i scorn the antique 
2	why these are the children of the antique to justify it 
2	dead poets philosophs priests 
2	martyrs artists inventors governments long since 
2	language shapers on other shores 
2	nations once powerful now reduced withdrawn or desolate 
2	i dare not proceed till i respectfully credit what you have left

2	than water ebbs and flows 
2	and i will make the poems of my body and of mortality 
2	and i will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by
2	night between all the states and between any two of them 
2	and i will make a song for the ears of the president full of
2	weapons with menacing points 
2	and behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces 
2	and a song make i of the one form d out of all 
2	the fang d and glittering one whose head is over all 
2	resolute warlike one including and over all

2	indicating it in me 
2	i will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were
2	threatening to consume me 
2	i will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires 
2	i will give them complete abandonment 
2	i will write the evangel poem of comrades and of love 
2	for who but i should understand love with all its sorrow and joy

2	have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems 
2	i have heard what the talkers were talking the talk of the
2	beginning and the end 
2	but i do not talk of the beginning or the end 
2	there was never any more inception than there is now 
2	nor any more youth or age than there is now 
2	and will never be any more perfection than there is now 
2	nor any more heaven or hell than there is now 
2	urge and urge and urge 
2	always the procreant urge of the world

2	increase always sex

2	discuss i am silent and go bathe and admire myself 
2	less familiar than the rest

2	but they are not the me myself 
2	apart from the pulling and hauling stands what i am

2	not words not music or rhyme i want not custom or lecture not
2	even the best 
2	only the lull i like the hum of your valved voice 
2	i mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning 
2	to my bare stript heart 
2	and i know that the hand of god is the promise of my own 
2	and i know that the spirit of god is the brother of my own 
2	and that a kelson of the creation is love 
2	and limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields 
2	and brown ants in the little wells beneath them 
2	or i guess it is the handkerchief of the lord 
2	a scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt 
2	bearing the owner s name someway in the corners that we may see
2	and remark and say whose 
2	or i guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic 
2	and it means sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones 
2	growing among black folks as among white

2	receive them the same 
2	and now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves 
2	tenderly will i use you curling grass 
2	it may be you transpire from the breasts of young men 
2	it may be if i had known them i would have loved them 
2	and here you are the mothers laps 
2	dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths 
2	o i perceive after all so many uttering tongues 
2	soon out of their laps 
2	what do you think has become of the young and old men 
2	and what do you think has become of the women and children 
2	they are alive and well somewhere 
2	the smallest sprout shows there is really no death 
2	and ceas d the moment life appear d 
2	all goes onward and outward nothing collapses 
2	and to die is different from what any one supposed and luckier 
2	has any one supposed it lucky to be born 
2	and peruse manifold objects no two alike and every one good 
2	the earth good and the stars good and their adjuncts all good 
2	i am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth 
2	i am the mate and companion of people all just as immortal and
2	fathomless as myself 
2	 they do not know how immortal but i know 
2	every kind for itself and its own for me mine male and female 
2	for me those that have been boys and that love women 
2	mothers of mothers 
2	for me lips that have smiled eyes that have shed tears 
2	for me children and the begetters of children 
2	undrape you are not guilty to me nor stale nor discarded 
2	i see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no 
2	the little one sleeps in its cradle 
2	the suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom 
2	the heavy omnibus the driver with his interrogating thumb the
2	clank of the shod horses on the granite floor 
2	the snow sleighs clinking shouted jokes pelts of snow balls 
2	the hurrahs for popular favorites the fury of rous d mobs 
2	the impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes 
2	give birth to babes 
2	the big doors of the country barn stand open and ready 
2	the dried grass of the harvest time loads the slow drawn wagon 
2	the clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged 
2	the armfuls are pack d to the sagging mow 
2	i am there i help i came stretch d atop of the load 
2	i felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other 
2	i jump from the cross beams and seize the clover and timothy 
2	and roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps 
2	alone far in the wilds and mountains i hunt 
2	wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee 
2	in the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night 
2	kindling a fire and broiling the fresh kill d game 
2	the boatmen and clam diggers arose early and stopt for me 
2	hanging from their shoulders 
2	the runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside 
2	i heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile 
2	coarse clean clothes 
2	twenty eight young men bathe by the shore 
2	twenty eight young men and all so friendly 
2	twenty eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome 
2	she owns the fine house by the rise of the bank 
2	she hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window 
2	which of the young men does she like the best 
2	ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her 
2	where are you off to lady for i see you 
2	you splash in the water there yet stay stock still in your room 
2	an unseen hand also pass d over their bodies 
2	it descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs 
2	i loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break down 
2	blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil 
2	from the cinder strew d threshold i follow their movements 
2	they do not hasten each man hits in his place 
2	his blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over
2	in me the caresser of life wherever moving backward as well as
2	forward sluing 
2	it seems to me more than all the print i have read in my life 
2	my tread scares the wood drake and wood duck on my distant and
2	day long ramble 
2	they rise together they slowly circle around 
2	i believe in those wing d purposes 
2	and acknowledge red yellow white playing within me 
2	and consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional 
2	the wild gander leads his flock through the cool night 
2	ya honk he says and sounds it down to me like an invitation 
2	the pert may suppose it meaningless but i listening close 
2	find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky 
2	the litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats 
2	the brood of the turkey hen and she with her half spread wings 
2	i see in them and myself the same old law 
2	the press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections 
2	they scorn the best i can do to relate them 
2	i am enamour d of growing out doors 
2	of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods 
2	i can eat and sleep with them week in and week out 
2	what is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is me 
2	me going in for my chances spending for vast returns 
2	adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me 
2	not asking the sky to come down to my good will 
2	scattering it freely forever 
2	the pure contralto sings in the organ loft 
2	the carpenter dresses his plank the tongue of his foreplane
2	whistles its wild ascending lisp 
2	the deacons are ordain d with cross d hands at the altar 
2	the jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case 
2	what is removed drops horribly in a pail 
2	the bugle calls in the ball room the gentlemen run for their
2	partners the dancers bow to each other 
2	the youth lies awake in the cedar roof d garret and harks to the
2	musical rain 
2	the wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the huron 
2	the connoisseur peers along the exhibition gallery with half shut
2	as the deck hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for
2	the one year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne
2	with blue and gold 
2	the drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray 
2	the bride unrumples her white dress the minute hand of the clock
2	the opium eater reclines with rigid head and just open d lips 
2	the crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths the men jeer and wink to
2	 miserable i do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you 
2	the floor men are laying the floor the tinners are tinning the
2	roof the masons are calling for mortar 
2	in single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers 
2	off on the lakes the pike fisher watches and waits by the hole in
2	those drain d by the tennessee or through those of the arkansas 
2	the city sleeps and the country sleeps 
2	the living sleep for their time the dead sleep for their time 
2	and such as it is to be of these more or less i am 
2	and of these one and all i weave the song of myself 
2	i am of old and young of the foolish as much as the wise 
2	regardless of others ever regardful of others 
2	maternal as well as paternal a child as well as a man 
2	stuff d with the stuff that is coarse and stuff d with the stuff

2	with music strong i come with my cornets and my drums 
2	i play not marches for accepted victors only i play marches for

2	i beat and pound for the dead 
2	i blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them

2	i find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance 
2	soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine 
2	thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start

2	unscrew the locks from the doors 
2	unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs 
2	whoever degrades another degrades me 
2	and whatever is done or said returns at last to me 
2	i speak the pass word primeval i give the sign of democracy 
2	by god i will accept nothing which all cannot have their
2	counterpart of on the same terms 
2	voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves 
2	voices of the diseas d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs 
2	voices of cycles of preparation and accretion 
2	and of the rights of them the others are down upon 
2	of the deform d trivial flat foolish despised 
2	fog in the air beetles rolling balls of dung 
2	through me forbidden voices 
2	voices of sexes and lusts voices veil d and i remove the veil 
2	voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur d 
2	i do not press my fingers across my mouth 
2	i believe in the flesh and the appetites 
2	the scent of these arm pits aroma finer than prayer 
2	this head more than churches bibles and all the creeds 
2	translucent mould of me it shall be you 
2	shaded ledges and rests it shall be you 
2	firm masculine colter it shall be you 
2	whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you 
2	you my rich blood your milky stream pale strippings of my life 
2	breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you

2	you sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you 
2	i dote on myself there is that lot of me and all so luscious 
2	each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy 
2	friendship i take again 
2	that i walk up my stoop i pause to consider if it really be 
2	to behold the day break 
2	the little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows 
2	the air tastes good to my palate 
2	hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising
2	freshly exuding 
2	scooting obliquely high and low 
2	something i cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs 
2	seas of bright juice suffuse heaven 
2	the mocking taunt see then whether you shall be master 
2	dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun rise would kill me 
2	if i could not now and always send sun rise out of me 
2	we also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun 
2	we found our own o my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak 
2	my voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach 
2	speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measure itself 
2	walt you contain enough why don t you let it out then 
2	come now i will not be tantalized you conceive too much of
2	articulation 
2	do you not know o speech how the buds beneath you are folded 
2	waiting in gloom protected by frost 
2	the dirt receding before my prophetical screams 
2	i underlying causes to balance them at last 
2	i crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you 
2	writing and talk do not prove me 
2	i carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face 
2	with the hush of my lips i wholly confound the skeptic 
2	now i will do nothing but listen 
2	i hear the sound i love the sound of the human voice 
2	i hear all sounds running together combined fused or following 
2	work people at their meals 
2	the heave e yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves the
2	refrain of the anchor lifters 
2	i hear the violoncello tis the young man s heart s complaint 
2	it shakes mad sweet pangs through my belly and breast 
2	i hear the chorus it is a grand opera 
2	ah this indeed is music this suits me 
2	a tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me 
2	the orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full 
2	i hear the train d soprano what work with hers is this 
2	the orchestra whirls me wider than uranus flies 
2	it wrenches such ardors from me i did not know i possess d them 
2	and that we call being 
2	to be in any form what is that 
2	 round and round we go all of us and ever come back thither 
2	mine is no callous shell 
2	i have instant conductors all over me whether i pass or stop 
2	they seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me 
2	i merely stir press feel with my fingers and am happy 
2	is this then a touch quivering me to a new identity 
2	flames and ether making a rush for my veins 
2	treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them 
2	my flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly
2	on all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs 
2	straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip 
2	behaving licentious toward me taking no denial 
2	depriving me of my best as for a purpose 
2	unbuttoning my clothes holding me by the bare waist 
2	then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me 
2	the sentries desert every other part of me 
2	they have left me helpless to a red marauder 
2	they all come to the headland to witness and assist against me 
2	i am given up by traitors 
2	i talk wildly i have lost my wits i and nobody else am the
2	greatest traitor 
2	parting track d by arriving perpetual payment of perpetual loan 
2	all truths wait in all things 
2	they neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it 
2	they do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon 
2	the insignificant is as big to me as any 
2	 what is less or more than a touch 
2	logic and sermons never convince 
2	the damp of the night drives deeper into my soul 
2	 only what proves itself to every man and woman is so 
2	only what nobody denies is so 
2	a minute and a drop of me settle my brain 
2	i believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps 
2	and a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman 
2	becomes omnific 
2	and until one and all shall delight us and we them 
2	and the tree toad is a chef d oeuvre for the highest 
2	and the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven 
2	and the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery 
2	and the cow crunching with depress d head surpasses any statue 
2	and a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels 
2	i find i incorporate gneiss coal long threaded moss fruits 
2	grains esculent roots 
2	and am stucco d with quadrupeds and birds all over 
2	and have distanced what is behind me for good reasons 
2	but call any thing back again when i desire it 
2	in vain the speeding or shyness 
2	in vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes 
2	in vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs 
2	in vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods 
2	in vain the razor bill d auk sails far north to labrador 
2	i stand and look at them long and long 
2	they do not sweat and whine about their condition 
2	they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins 
2	they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god 
2	not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania of
2	owning things 
2	not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth 
2	so they show their relations to me and i accept them 
2	they bring me tokens of myself they evince them plainly in their
2	i wonder where they get those tokens 
2	did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them 
2	myself moving forward then and now and forever 
2	gathering and showing more always and with velocity 
2	infinite and omnigenous and the like of these among them 
2	not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers 
2	limbs glossy and supple tail dusting the ground 
2	his nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him 
2	i but use you a minute then i resign you stallion 
2	why do i need your paces when i myself out gallop them 
2	even as i stand or sit passing faster than you 
2	space and time now i see it is true what i guess d at 
2	what i guess d when i loaf d on the grass 
2	what i guess d while i lay alone in my bed 
2	my ties and ballasts leave me my elbows rest in sea gaps 
2	i skirt sierras my palms cover continents 
2	i am afoot with my vision 
2	crossing savannas trailing in forests 
2	prospecting gold digging girdling the trees of a new purchase 
2	scorch d ankle deep by the hot sand hauling my boat down the
2	shallow river 
2	where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead where the
2	buck turns furiously at the hunter 
2	where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock where the
2	where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou 
2	where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where the
2	beaver pats the mud with his paddle shaped tall 
2	over the sharp peak d farm house with its scallop d scum and
2	slender shoots from the gutters 
2	over the western persimmon over the long leav d corn over the
2	delicate blue flower flax 
2	goldbug drops through the dark 
2	where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous
2	shuddering of their hides 
2	myself and looking composedly down 
2	where the life car is drawn on the slip noose where the heat
2	hatches pale green eggs in the dented sand 
2	where the she whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it 
2	where the steam ship trails hind ways its long pennant of smoke 
2	at he festivals with blackguard gibes ironical license 
2	bull dances drinking laughter 
2	at apple peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit i find 
2	screams weeps 
2	where the humming bird shimmers where the neck of the long lived
2	where the laughing gull scoots by the shore where she laughs her
2	where band neck d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with
2	their heads out 
2	where burial coaches enter the arch d gates of a cemetery 
2	where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees 
2	where the yellow crown d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at
2	night and feeds upon small crabs 
2	where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon 
2	through the gymnasium through the curtain d saloon through the
2	office or public hall 
2	pleas d with the homely woman as well as the handsome 
2	looking in at the shop windows of broadway the whole forenoon 
2	flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass 
2	hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any 
2	hot toward one i hate ready in my madness to knife him 
2	speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the
2	diameter of eighty thousand miles 
2	speeding with tail d meteors throwing fire balls like the rest 
2	backing and filling appearing and disappearing 
2	i tread day and night such roads 
2	i visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product 
2	and look at quintillions ripen d and look at quintillions green 
2	i fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul 
2	my course runs below the soundings of plummets 
2	i help myself to material and immaterial 
2	no guard can shut me off no law prevent me 
2	i anchor my ship for a little while only 
2	i go hunting polar furs and the seal leaping chasms with a
2	pike pointed staff clinging to topples of brittle and blue 
2	i ascend to the foretruck 
2	i take my place late at night in the crow s nest 
2	we sail the arctic sea it is plenty light enough 
2	the white topt mountains show in the distance i fling out my
2	fancies toward them 
2	or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin d city 
2	i am a free companion i bivouac by invading watchfires 
2	i turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself 
2	i tighten her all night to my thighs and lips 
2	i understand the large hearts of heroes 
2	the courage of present times and all times 
2	how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the
2	steamship and death chasing it up and down the storm 
2	how he follow d with them and tack d with them three days and
2	would not give it up 
2	how he saved the drifting company at last 
2	how the lank loose gown d women look d when boated from the
2	side of their prepared graves 
2	how the silent old faced infants and the lifted sick and the
2	sharp lipp d unshaved men 
2	the disdain and calmness of martyrs 
2	the hounded slave that flags in the race leans by the fence 
2	blowing cover d with sweat 
2	all these i feel or am 
2	i am the hounded slave i wince at the bite of the dogs 
2	hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen 
2	ooze of my skin 
2	i fall on the weeds and stones 
2	the riders spur their unwilling horses haul close 
2	agonies are one of my changes of garments 
2	i do not ask the wounded person how he feels i myself become the
2	my hurts turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observe 
2	i am the mash d fireman with breast bone broken 
2	tumbling walls buried me in their debris 
2	they have clear d the beams away they tenderly lift me forth 
2	white and beautiful are the faces around me the heads are bared
2	of their fire caps 
2	the kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches 
2	distant and dead resuscitate 
2	i am an old artillerist i tell of my fort s bombardment 
2	i am there again 
2	again the long roll of the drummers 
2	again the attacking cannon mortars 
2	again to my listening ears the cannon responsive 
2	i take part i see and hear the whole 
2	the cries curses roar the plaudits for well aim d shots 
2	the ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip 
2	workmen searching after damages making indispensable repairs 
2	again gurgles the mouth of my dying general he furiously waves

2	none obey d the command to kneel 
2	some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight 
2	the three were all torn and cover d with the boy s blood 
2	at eleven o clock began the burning of the bodies 
2	would you hear of an old time sea fight

2	he is not hurried his voice is neither high nor low 
2	his eyes give more light to us than our battle lanterns 
2	stretch d and still lies the midnight 
2	two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness 
2	near by the corpse of the child that serv d in the cabin 
2	the dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully
2	curl d whiskers 
2	formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves dabs of flesh
2	the hiss of the surgeon s knife the gnawing teeth of his saw

2	heard it and heard it of several thousand years 
2	it is middling well as far as it goes but is that all 
2	magnifying and applying come i 
2	outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters 
2	taking myself the exact dimensions of jehovah 
2	lithographing kronos zeus his son and hercules his grandson 
2	buying drafts of osiris isis belus brahma buddha 
2	with odin and the hideous faced mexitli and every idol and image 
2	admitting they were alive and did the work of their days 
2	accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself 
2	discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house 
2	putting higher claims for him there with his roll d up sleeves
2	driving the mallet and chisel 
2	minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction 
2	their brawny limbs passing safe over charr d laths their white

2	by my life lumps becoming already a creator 
2	putting myself here and now to the ambush d womb of the shadows 
2	a call in the midst of the crowd 
2	my own voice orotund sweeping and final 
2	come my children 
2	come my boys and girls my women household and intimates 
2	easily written loose finger d chords i feel the thrum of your
2	climax and close 
2	my head slues round on my neck 
2	music rolls but not from the organ 
2	folks are around me but they are no household of mine 
2	ever the hard unsunk ground 
2	ever myself and my neighbors refreshing wicked real 
2	ever the old inexplicable query ever that thorn d thumb that
2	breath of itches and thirsts 
2	ever the vexer s hoot hoot till we find where the sly one hides
2	ever love ever the sobbing liquid of life 
2	ever the bandage under the chin ever the trestles of death 
2	here and there with dimes on the eyes walking 
2	to feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning 
2	a few idly owning and they the wheat continually claiming 
2	this is the city and i am one of the citizens 
2	the mayor and councils banks tariffs steamships factories 
2	stocks stores real estate and personal estate 
2	what i do and say the same waits for them 
2	every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them 
2	i know perfectly well my own egotism 
2	know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less 
2	and would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself 
2	not words of routine this song of mine 
2	but abruptly to question to leap beyond yet nearer bring 
2	this printed and bound book but the printer and the
2	printing office boy 
2	in the houses the dishes and fare and furniture but the host and
2	the sky up there yet here or next door or across the way 
2	the saints and sages in history but you yourself 
2	sermons creeds theology but the fathomless human brain 
2	and what is reason and what is love and what is life 
2	i do not despise you priests all time the world over 
2	my faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths 
2	helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols 
2	dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession rapt and
2	drinking mead from the skull cap to shastas and vedas admirant 
2	minding the koran 
2	accepting the gospels accepting him that was crucified knowing
2	assuredly that he is divine 
2	to the mass kneeling or the puritan s prayer rising or sitting
2	patiently in a pew 
2	one of that centripetal and centrifugal gang i turn and talk like
2	down hearted doubters dull and excluded 
2	how the flukes splash 
2	be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers 
2	i take my place among you as much as among any 
2	the past is the push of you me all precisely the same 
2	i do not know what is untried and afterward 
2	but i know it will in its turn prove sufficient and cannot fail 
2	each who passes is consider d each who stops is consider d not
2	single one can it fall 
2	it cannot fall the young man who died and was buried 
2	nor the young woman who died and was put by his side 
2	nor the old man who has lived without purpose and feels it with
2	bitterness worse than gall 
2	nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder 
2	nor the numberless slaughter d and wreck d nor the brutish koboo
2	nor the present nor the least wisp that is known 
2	it is time to explain myself let us stand up 
2	what is known i strip away 
2	i launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown 
2	the clock indicates the moment but what does eternity indicate 
2	we have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers 
2	there are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them 
2	births have brought us richness and variety 
2	and other births will bring us richness and variety 
2	i do not call one greater and one smaller 
2	that which fills its period and place is equal to any 
2	all has been gentle with me i keep no account with lamentation 
2	 what have i to do with lamentation 
2	my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs 
2	rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me 
2	afar down i see the huge first nothing i know i was even there 
2	i waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist 
2	long i was hugg d close long and long 
2	immense have been the preparations for me 
2	faithful and friendly the arms that have help d me 
2	they sent influences to look after what was to hold me 
2	before i was born out of my mother generations guided me 
2	my embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it 
2	for it the nebula cohered to an orb 
2	the long slow strata piled to rest it on 
2	vast vegetables gave it sustenance 
2	o span of youth ever push d elasticity 
2	o manhood balanced florid and full 
2	my lovers suffocate me 
2	crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin 
2	chirping over my head 
2	calling my name from flower beds vines tangled underbrush 
2	lighting on every moment of my life 
2	bussing my body with soft balsamic busses 
2	and the dark hush promulges as much as any 
2	i open my scuttle at night and see the far sprinkled systems 
2	wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding 
2	outward and outward and forever outward 
2	my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels 
2	he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit 
2	there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage 
2	not avail the long run 
2	we should surely bring up again where we now stand 
2	and surely go as much farther and then farther and farther 
2	a few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues do
2	they are but parts any thing is but a part 
2	see ever so far there is limitless space outside of that 
2	count ever so much there is limitless time around that 
2	my rendezvous is appointed it is certain 
2	the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms 
2	the great camerado the lover true for whom i pine will be there 
2	i tramp a perpetual journey come listen all 
2	i have no chair no church no philosophy 
2	i lead no man to a dinner table library exchange 
2	but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll 
2	my left hand hooking you round the waist 
2	not i not any one else can travel that road for you 
2	you must travel it for yourself 
2	it is not far it is within reach 
2	perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know 
2	and in due time you shall repay the same service to me 
2	for after we start we never lie by again 
2	be fill d and satisfied then 
2	you are also asking me questions and i hear you 
2	i answer that i cannot answer you must find out for yourself 
2	sit a while dear son 
2	here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink 
2	long enough have you dream d contemptible dreams 
2	now i wash the gum from your eyes 
2	you must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every
2	moment of your life 
2	long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore 
2	now i will you to be a bold swimmer 
2	i am the teacher of athletes 
2	the boy i love the same becomes a man not through derived power 
2	wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear 
2	fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak 
2	skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo 
2	and those well tann d to those that keep out of the sun 
2	i teach straying from me yet who can stray from me 
2	i follow you whoever you are from the present hour 
2	my words itch at your ears till you understand them 
2	i swear i will never again mention love or death inside a house 
2	if you would understand me go to the heights or water shore 
2	no shutter d room or school can commune with me 
2	but roughs and little children better than they 
2	the young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well 
2	the soldier camp d or upon the march is mine 
2	the young mother and old mother comprehend me 
2	i have said that the soul is not more than the body 
2	and i have said that the body is not more than the soul 
2	and nothing not god is greater to one than one s self is 
2	and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own
2	funeral drest in his shroud 
2	and i say to mankind be not curious about god 
2	for i who am curious about each am not curious about god 
2	 no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and
2	about death 
2	why should i wish to see god better than this day 
2	to his work without flinching the accoucheur comes 
2	i see the elder hand pressing receiving supporting 
2	i recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors 
2	and mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape 
2	i smell the white roses sweet scented and growing 
2	and as to you life i reckon you are the leavings of many deaths 
2	 no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before 
2	i hear you whispering there o stars of heaven 
2	o suns o grass of graves o perpetual transfers and promotions 
2	if you do not say any thing how can i say any thing 
2	of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest 
2	of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight 
2	toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs 
2	i ascend from the moon i ascend from the night 
2	wrench d and sweaty calm and cool then my body becomes 
2	i sleep i sleep long 
2	i do not know it it is without name it is a word unsaid 
2	it is not in any dictionary utterance symbol 
2	something it swings on more than the earth i swing on 
2	to it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me 
2	do you see o my brothers and sisters 
2	it is not chaos or death it is form union plan it is eternal
2	life it is happiness 
2	the past and present wilt i have fill d them emptied them 
2	and proceed to fill my next fold of the future 
2	listener up there what have you to confide to me 
2	look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening 
2	do i contradict myself 
2	very well then i contradict myself 
2	 i am large i contain multitudes 
2	i concentrate toward them that are nigh i wait on the door slab 
2	will you speak before i am gone will you prove already too late 
2	the spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me he complains of my gab
2	i too am not a bit tamed i too am untranslatable 
2	i sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world 
2	the last scud of day holds back for me 
2	i depart as air i shake my white locks at the runaway sun 
2	i effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags 
2	i bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass i love 
2	if you want me again look for me under your boot soles 
2	you will hardly know who i am or what i mean 
2	but i shall be good health to you nevertheless 
2	and filter and fibre your blood 
2	failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged 
2	missing me one place search another 
2	i stop somewhere waiting for you 
2	to the garden the world anew ascending 
2	potent mates daughters sons preluding 
2	the love the life of their bodies meaning and being 
2	curious here behold my resurrection after slumber 
2	the revolving cycles in their wide sweep having brought me again 
2	my limbs and the quivering fire that ever plays through them for
2	existing i peer and penetrate still 
2	content with the present content with the past 
2	by my side or back of me eve following 
2	or in front and i following her just the same 
2	from pent up aching rivers 
2	from that of myself without which i were nothing 
2	from my own voice resonant singing the phallus 
2	singing the song of procreation 
2	singing the bedfellow s song o resistless yearning 
2	o for any and each the body correlative attracting 
2	from the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day 
2	from native moments from bashful pains singing them 
2	seeking something yet unfound though i have diligently sought it
2	many a long year 
2	singing the true song of the soul fitful at random 
2	renascent with grossest nature or among animals 
2	of that of them and what goes with them my poems informing 
2	of the smell of apples and lemons of the pairing of birds 
2	of the wet of woods of the lapping of waves 
2	of the mad pushes of waves upon the land i them chanting 
2	the overture lightly sounding the strain anticipating 
2	the welcome nearness the sight of the perfect body 
2	the swimmer swimming naked in the bath or motionless on his back
2	 hark close and still what i now whisper to you 
2	i love you o you entirely possess me 
2	lawless than we 
2	the furious storm through me careering i passionately trembling 
2	 o i willingly stake all for you 
2	o let me be lost if it must be so 
2	o you and i what is it to us what the rest do or think 
2	what is all else to us only that we enjoy each other and exhaust
2	from the master the pilot i yield the vessel to 
2	from privacy from frequent repinings alone 
2	from plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near 
2	from the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingers
2	through my hair and beard 
2	from the long sustain d kiss upon the mouth or bosom 
2	from the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk fainting
2	with excess 
2	from what the divine husband knows from the work of fatherhood 
2	from the act poems of eyes hands hips and bosoms 
2	from the cling of the trembling arm 
2	from the bending curve and the clinch 
2	from side by side the pliant coverlet off throwing 
2	 yet a moment o tender waiter and i return 
2	from the hour of shining stars and dropping dews 
2	from the night a moment i emerging flitting out 
2	celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for 
2	and you stalwart loins 
2	i sing the body electric 
2	the armies of those i love engirth me and i engirth them 
2	they will not let me off till i go with them respond to them 
2	and if the body were not the soul what is the soul 
2	that of the male is perfect and that of the female is perfect 
2	the expression of the face balks account 
2	contour of their shape downwards 
2	the swimmer naked in the swimming bath seen as he swims through
2	the transparent green shine or lies with his face up and rolls
2	silently to and from the heave of the water 
2	the bending forward and backward of rowers in row boats the
2	horse man in his saddle 
2	girls mothers house keepers in all their performances 
2	the group of laborers seated at noon time with their open
2	dinner kettles and their wives waiting 
2	the young fellow hosing corn the sleigh driver driving his six
2	horses through the crowd 
2	the slow return from the fire the pause when the bell strikes
2	suddenly again and the listening on the alert 
2	the natural perfect varied attitudes the bent head the curv d
2	i knew a man a common farmer the father of five sons 
2	and in them the fathers of sons and in them the fathers of sons 
2	this man was a wonderful vigor calmness beauty of person 
2	the shape of his head the pale yellow and white of his hair and
2	beard the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes the richness
2	and breadth of his manners 
2	these i used to go and visit him to see he was wise also 
2	he was six feet tall he was over eighty years old his sons were
2	they and his daughters loved him all who saw him loved him 
2	clear brown skin of his face 
2	fowling pieces presented to him by men that loved him 
2	i have perceiv d that to be with those i like is enough 
2	to stop in company with the rest at evening is enough 
2	i do not ask any more delight i swim in it as in a sea 
2	there is something in staying close to men and women and looking
2	this is the female form 
2	a divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot 
2	it attracts with fierce undeniable attraction 
2	books art religion time the visible and solid earth and what
2	mad filaments ungovernable shoots play out of it the response
2	likewise ungovernable 
2	hair bosom hips bend of legs negligent falling hands all
2	diffused mine too diffused 
2	lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet flesh d day 
2	you are the gates of the body and you are the gates of the soul 
2	the female contains all qualities and tempers them 
2	she is in her place and moves with perfect balance 
2	she is all things duly veil d she is both passive and active 
2	as i see my soul reflected in nature 
2	as i see through a mist one with inexpressible completeness 
2	sanity beauty 
2	the male is not less the soul nor more he too is in his place 
2	he too is all qualities he is action and power 
2	the flush of the known universe is in him 
2	whatever the survey whatever the sea and the sail he strikes
2	soundings at last only here 
2	 where else does he strike soundings except here 
2	the man s body is sacred and the woman s body is sacred 
2	no matter who it is it is sacred is it the meanest one in the

2	i draw you close to me you women 
2	i cannot let you go i would do you good 
2	envelop d in you sleep greater heroes and bards 
2	they refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me 
2	it is i you women i make my way 
2	i am stern acrid large undissuadable but i love you 
2	i do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you 
2	i brace myself effectually i listen to no entreaties 
2	through you i drain the pent up rivers of myself 
2	in you i wrap a thousand onward years 
2	on you i graft the grafts of the best beloved of me and america 
2	the drops i distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls 
2	the babes i beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn 
2	i shall demand perfect men and women out of my love spendings 
2	i shall expect them to interpenetrate with others as i and you
2	inter penetrate now 
2	i shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them as i
2	count on the fruits of the gushing showers i give now 
2	i shall look for loving crops from the birth life death 
2	immortality i plant so lovingly now 
2	the loving day the mounting sun the friend i am happy with 
2	the arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder 
2	the hillside whiten d with blossoms of the mountain ash 
2	the rich coverlet of the grass animals and birds the private
2	untrimm d bank the primitive apples the pebble stones 
2	beautiful dripping fragments the negligent list of one after
2	another as i happen to call them to me or think of them 
2	the real poems what we call poems being merely pictures 
2	the poems of the privacy of the night and of men like me 
2	earth of chaste love life that is only life after love 
2	soft forenoon airs that blow from the south west 
2	the wet of woods through the early hours 
2	the dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and
2	content to the ground 
2	the no form d stings that sights people objects sting me with 
2	the sensitive orbic underlapp d brothers that only privileged
2	feelers may be intimate where they are 
2	edge themselves 
2	the limpid liquid within the young man 
2	the vex d corrosion so pensive and so painful 
2	the torment the irritable tide that will not be at rest 
2	the like of the same i feel the like of the same in others 
2	the young man that flushes and flushes and the young woman that
2	flushes and flushes 
2	the young man that wakes deep at night the hot hand seeking to
2	repress what would master him 
2	sun the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them 
2	the walnut trunk the walnut husks and the ripening or ripen d
2	long round walnuts 
2	the continence of vegetables birds animals 
2	the wholesome relief repose content 
2	and this bunch pluck d at random from myself 
2	it has done its work i toss it carelessly to fall where it may 
2	one hour to madness and joy o furious o confine me not 
2	 what is this that frees me so in storms 
2	what do my shouts amid lightnings and raging winds mean 
2	o to drink the mystic deliria deeper than any other man 
2	o savage and tender achings i bequeath them to you my children 
2	o to return to paradise o bashful and feminine 
2	o the puzzle the thrice tied knot the deep and dark pool all
2	untied and illumin d 
2	o to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last 
2	to find a new unthought of nonchalance with the best of nature 
2	to have the gag remov d from one s mouth 
2	to have the feeling to day or any day i am sufficient as i am 
2	o something unprov d something in a trance 
2	to escape utterly from others anchors and holds 
2	to drive free to love free to dash reckless and dangerous 
2	to court destruction with taunts with invitations 
2	to ascend to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me 
2	to rise thither with my inebriate soul 
2	to be lost if it must be so 
2	out of the rolling ocean the crowd came a drop gently to me 
2	whispering i love you before long i die 
2	i have travel d a long way merely to look on you to touch you 
2	for i could not die till i once look d on you 
2	for i fear d i might afterward lose you 
2	now we have met we have look d we are safe 
2	return in peace to the ocean my love 
2	but as for me for you the irresistible sea is to separate us 
2	ocean and the land 
2	every day at sundown for your dear sake my love 
2	ages and ages returning at intervals 
2	undestroy d wandering immortal 
2	lusty phallic with the potent original loins perfectly sweet 
2	i chanter of adamic songs 
2	through the new garden the west the great cities calling 
2	offspring of my loins 
2	we two how long we were fool d
2	we two how long we were fool d 
2	now transmuted we swiftly escape as nature escapes 
2	we are nature long have we been absent but now we return 
2	we become plants trunks foliage roots bark 
2	we are bedded in the ground we are rocks 
2	we are oaks we grow in the openings side by side 
2	we browse we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any 
2	we are two fishes swimming in the sea together 
2	we are also the coarse smut of beasts vegetables minerals 
2	we are two predatory hawks we soar above and look down 
2	we are two resplendent suns we it is who balance ourselves orbic
2	we prowl fang d and four footed in the woods we spring on prey 
2	we are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead 
2	we are seas mingling we are two of those cheerful waves rolling
2	over each other and interwetting each other 
2	o hymen o hymenee why do you tantalize me thus 
2	o why sting me for a swift moment only 
2	why can you not continue o why do you now cease 
2	is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would
2	soon certainly kill me 
2	i am he that aches with love
2	i am he that aches with amorous love 
2	native moments when you come upon me ah you are here now 
2	give me now libidinous joys only 
2	give me the drench of my passions give me life coarse and rank 
2	to day i go consort with nature s darlings to night too 
2	i dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers 
2	i come forthwith in your midst i will be your poet 
2	i will be more to you than to any of the rest 
2	once i pass d through a populous city
2	yet now of all that city i remember only a woman i casually met
2	there who detain d me for love of me 
2	day by day and night by night we were together all else has long
2	i remember i say only that woman who passionately clung to me 
2	again we wander we love we separate again 
2	again she holds me by the hand i must not go 
2	i see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous 
2	i heard you solemn sweet pipes of the organ as last sunday morn i
2	winds of autumn as i walk d the woods at dusk i heard your long 
2	facing west from california s shores
2	facing west from california s shores 
2	inquiring tireless seeking what is yet unfound 
2	i a child very old over waves towards the house of maternity 
2	look off the shores of my western sea the circle almost circled 
2	now i face home again very pleas d and joyous 
2	 but where is what i started for so long ago 
2	and why is it yet unfound 
2	as adam early in the morning 
2	walking forth from the bower refresh d with sleep 
2	behold me where i pass hear my voice approach 
2	touch me touch the palm of your hand to my body as i pass 
2	be not afraid of my body 
2	in paths untrodden 
2	in the growth by margins of pond waters 
2	escaped from the life that exhibits itself 
2	from all the standards hitherto publish d from the pleasures 
2	profits conformities 
2	which too long i was offering to feed my soul 
2	here by myself away from the clank of the world 
2	tallying and talk d to here by tongues aromatic 
2	no longer abash d for in this secluded spot i can respond as i
2	would not dare elsewhere 
2	resolv d to sing no songs to day but those of manly attachment 
2	projecting them along that substantial life 
2	bequeathing hence types of athletic love 
2	afternoon this delicious ninth month in my forty first year 
2	i proceed for all who are or have been young men 
2	to tell the secret my nights and days 
2	to celebrate the need of comrades 
2	scented herbage of my breast 
2	leaves from you i glean i write to be perused best afterwards 
2	tomb leaves body leaves growing up above me above death 
2	perennial roots tall leaves o the winter shall not freeze you
2	delicate leaves 
2	every year shall you bloom again out from where you retired you
2	shall emerge again 
2	o slender leaves o blossoms of my blood i permit you to tell in
2	you are often more bitter than i can bear you burn and sting me 
2	think of death 
2	death is beautiful from you what indeed is finally beautiful
2	except death and love 
2	 i am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most 
2	do not fold yourself so in your pink tinged roots timid leaves 
2	do not remain down there so ashamed herbage of my breast 
2	come i am determin d to unbare this broad breast of mine i have
2	long enough stifled and choked 
2	i will sound myself and comrades only i will never again utter a
2	i will raise with it immortal reverberations through the states 
2	i will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will
2	through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating 
2	give me your tone therefore o death that i may accord with it 
2	that you beyond them come forth to remain the real reality 
2	that you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance 
2	whoever you are holding me now in hand 
2	without one thing all will be useless 
2	i give you fair warning before you attempt me further 
2	i am not what you supposed but far different 
2	who is he that would become my follower 
2	who would sign himself a candidate for my affections 
2	the way is suspicious the result uncertain perhaps destructive 
2	your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting 
2	put me down and depart on your way 
2	or else by stealth in some wood for trial 
2	or back of a rock in the open air 
2	 for in any roof d room of a house i emerge not nor in company 
2	here to put your lips upon mine i permit you 
2	with the comrade s long dwelling kiss or the new husband s kiss 
2	for i am the new husband and i am the comrade 
2	or if you will thrusting me beneath your clothing 
2	where i may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip 
2	carry me when you go forth over land or sea 
2	for thus merely touching you is enough is best 
2	but these leaves conning you con at peril 
2	for these leaves and me you will not understand 
2	they will elude you at first and still more afterward i will
2	certainly elude you 
2	nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me 
2	prove victorious 
2	nor will my poems do good only they will do just as much evil 
2	perhaps more 
2	for all is useless without that which you may guess at many times
2	therefore release me and depart on your way 
2	come i will make the continent indissoluble 
2	i will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon 
2	i will make divine magnetic lands 
2	with the love of comrades 
2	with the life long love of comrades 
2	by the manly love of comrades 
2	for you these from me o democracy to serve you ma femme 
2	for you for you i am trilling these songs 
2	these i singing in spring collect for lovers 
2	 wild flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and
2	partly cover them beyond these i pass 
2	far far in the forest or sauntering later in summer before i
2	think where i go 
2	collecting dispensing singing there i wander with them 
2	plucking something for tokens tossing toward whoever is near me 
2	here some pinks and laurel leaves and a handful of sage 
2	and here what i now draw from the water wading in the pondside 
2	 o here i last saw him that tenderly loves me and returns again
2	never to separate from me 
2	and this o this shall henceforth be the token of comrades this
2	calamus root shall 
2	interchange it youths with each other let none render it back 
2	and twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut 
2	and stems of currants and plum blows and the aromatic cedar 
2	these i compass d around by a thick cloud of spirits 
2	not heaving from my ribb d breast only
2	not heaving from my ribb d breast only 
2	not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself 
2	not in those long drawn ill supprest sighs 
2	not in many an oath and promise broken 
2	not in my wilful and savage soul s volition 
2	not in the subtle nourishment of the air 
2	not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists 
2	not in husky pantings through clinch d teeth 
2	nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day 
2	not in any or all of them o adhesiveness o pulse of my life 
2	of the terrible doubt of appearances 
2	of the uncertainty after all that we may be deluded 
2	that may be reliance and hope are but speculations after all 
2	that may be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only 
2	may be the things i perceive the animals plants men hills 
2	shining and flowing waters 
2	something has yet to be known 
2	to me these and the like of these are curiously answer d by my
2	lovers my dear friends 
2	i cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity
2	beyond the grave 
2	but i walk or sit indifferent i am satisfied 
2	he ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me 
2	and now gentlemen 
2	a word i give to remain in your memories and minds 
2	as base and finale too for all metaphysics 
2	 so to the students the old professor 
2	at the close of his crowded course 
2	stated the lore of plato and socrates greater than plato 
2	and greater than socrates sought and stated christ divine having
2	i see reminiscent to day those greek and germanic systems 
2	see the philosophies all christian churches and tenets see 
2	of city for city and land for land 
2	recorders ages hence 
2	come i will take you down underneath this impassive exterior i
2	will tell you what to say of me 
2	dissatisfied at night 
2	me that follow d 
2	but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health 
2	refresh d singing inhaling the ripe breath of autumn 
2	when i wander d alone over the beach and undressing bathed 
2	laughing with the cool waters and saw the sun rise 
2	and when i thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way
2	coming o then i was happy 
2	o then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food
2	nourish d me more and the beautiful day pass d well 
2	and that night while all was still i heard the waters roll slowly
2	are you the new person drawn toward me 
2	do you think it so easy to have me become your lover 
2	do you see no further than this facade this smooth and tolerant
2	manner of me 
2	roots and leaves themselves alone are these 
2	love buds put before you and within you whoever you are 
2	buds to be unfolded on the old terms 
2	if you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers 
2	fruits tall branches and trees 
2	not heat flames up and consumes 
2	not sea waves hurry in and out 
2	waited sailing gracefully to drop where they may 
2	not these o none of these more than the flames of me consuming 
2	o none more than i hurrying in and out 
2	any more than my soul is borne through the open air 
2	wafted in all directions o love for friendship for you 
2	trickle drops my blue veins leaving 
2	o drops of me trickle slow drops 
2	candid from me falling drip bleeding drops 
2	from wounds made to free you whence you were prison d 
2	from my face from my forehead and lips 
2	saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet 
2	glow upon all i have written or shall write bleeding drops 
2	let it all be seen in your light blushing drops 
2	city of orgies walks and joys 
2	spectacles repay me 
2	goods in them 
2	offering response to my own these repay me 
2	lovers continual lovers only repay me 
2	behold this swarthy face these gray eyes 
2	this beard the white wool unclipt upon my neck 
2	my brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm 
2	and i on the crossing of the street or on the ship s deck give a
2	kiss in return 
2	we observe that salute of american comrades land and sea 
2	we are those two natural and nonchalant persons 
2	i saw in louisiana a live oak growing 
2	all alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches 
2	and brought it away and i have placed it in sight in my room 
2	it is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends 
2	 for i believe lately i think of little else than of them 
2	passing stranger you do not know how longingly i look upon you 
2	i have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you 
2	all is recall d as we flit by each other fluid affectionate 
2	chaste matured 
2	you grew up with me were a boy with me or a girl with me 
2	i ate with you and slept with you your body has become not yours
2	i am to wait i do not doubt i am to meet you again 
2	i am to see to it that i do not lose you 
2	this moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone 
2	attached to them as i do to men in my own lands 
2	o i know we should be brethren and lovers 
2	i know i should be happy with them 
2	 what indeed have i in common with them or what with the
2	destruction of them 
2	and in the fields and woods and above every keel little or large
2	without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument 
2	the institution of the dear love of comrades 
2	the prairie grass dividing its special odor breathing 
2	i demand of it the spiritual corresponding 
2	demand the most copious and close companionship of men 
2	demand the blades to rise of words acts beings 
2	those of the open atmosphere coarse sunlit fresh nutritious 
2	those that go their own gait erect stepping with freedom and
2	command leading not following 
2	those with a never quell d audacity those with sweet and lusty
2	flesh clear of taint 
2	when i persue the conquer d fame
2	when i peruse the conquer d fame of heroes and the victories of
2	mighty generals i do not envy the generals 
2	we two boys together clinging 
2	one the other never leaving 
2	up and down the roads going north and south excursions making 
2	power enjoying elbows stretching fingers clutching 
2	arm d and fearless eating drinking sleeping loving 
2	no law less than ourselves owning sailing soldiering thieving 
2	a promise to california 
2	for i know very well that i and robust love belong among you 
2	inland and along the western sea 
2	here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting 
2	here i shade and hide my thoughts i myself do not expose them 
2	and yet they expose me more than all my other poems 
2	no labor saving machine 
2	nor discovery have i made 
2	nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for america 
2	nor literary success nor intellect nor book for the book shelf 
2	but a few carols vibrating through the air i leave 
2	for comrades and lovers 
2	a glimpse through an interstice caught 
2	of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a bar room around the stove
2	late of a winter night and i unremark d seated in a corner 
2	of a youth who loves me and whom i love silently approaching and
2	a long while amid the noises of coming and going of drinking and
2	there we two content happy in being together speaking little 
2	perhaps not a word 
2	a leaf for hand in hand 
2	you natural persons old and young 
2	you on the mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of
2	you friendly boatmen and mechanics you roughs 
2	you twain and all processions moving along the streets 
2	i wish to infuse myself among you till i see it common for you to
2	earth my likeness 
2	though you look so impassive ample and spheric there 
2	i now suspect that is not all 
2	i dare not tell it in words not even in these songs 
2	i dream d in a dream
2	i dream d that was the new city of friends 
2	and in all their looks and words 
2	what think you i take my pen in hand to record 
2	the battle ship perfect model d majestic that i saw pass the
2	offing to day under full sail 
2	the splendors of the past day or the splendor of the night that
2	envelops me 
2	to the kanadian of the north to the southerner i love 
2	friendship exalte previously unknown 
2	sometimes with one i love
2	 i loved a certain person ardently and my love was not return d 
2	yet out of that i have written these songs 
2	many things to absorb i teach to help you become eleve of mine 
2	yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins 
2	fast anchor d eternal o love 
2	fast anchor d eternal o love o woman i love 
2	ethereal the last athletic reality my consolation 
2	i ascend i float in the regions of your love o man 
2	o sharer of my roving life 
2	among the men and women the multitude 
2	i perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs 
2	some are baffled but that one is not that one knows me 
2	ah lover and perfect equal 
2	i meant that you should discover me so by faint indirections 
2	and i when i meet you mean to discover you by the like in you 
2	playing within me 
2	but among my lovers and caroling these songs 
2	o i never doubt whether that is really me 
2	full of life now compact visible 
2	i forty years old the eighty third year of the states 
2	to one a century hence or any number of centuries hence 
2	to you yet unborn these seeking you 
2	when you read these i that was visible am become invisible 
2	now it is you compact visible realizing my poems seeking me 
2	o take my hand walt whitman

2	farewell my brethren

2	my time has ended my term has come 
2	along the northern coast 
2	just back from the rock bound shore and the caves 
2	in the saline air from the sea in the mendocino country 
2	with the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse 
2	i heard the might tree its death chant chanting 
2	the choppers heard not the camp shanties echoed not 
2	the quick ear d teamsters and chain and jack screw men heard not 
2	but in my soul i plainly heard 
2	murmuring out of its myriad leaves 
2	down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high 
2	out of its stalwart trunk and limbs out of its foot thick bark 
2	you untold life of me 
2	and all you venerable and innocent joys 
2	joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine 
2	our time our term has come

2	for a superber race they too to grandly fill their time 
2	for them we abdicate in them ourselves ye forest kings 
2	then to a loftier strain 
2	still prouder more ecstatic rose the chant 
2	as if the heirs the deities of the west 
2	joining with master tongue bore part 
2	not wan from asia s fetiches 
2	nor red from europe s old dynastic slaughter house 
2	 area of murder plots of thrones with scent left yet of wars and

2	here fill his time 
2	to duly fall to aid unreck d at last

2	thus on the northern coast 
2	in the echo of teamsters calls and the clinking chains and the
2	music of choppers axes 
2	the century lasting unseen dryads singing withdrawing 
2	all their recesses of forests and mountains leaving 
2	from the cascade range to the wahsatch or idaho far or utah 
2	to the deities of the modern henceforth yielding

2	and at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather 
2	over the hoarse surging of the sea 
2	or flitting from brier to brier by day 
2	i saw i heard at intervals the remaining one the he bird 
2	the solitary guest from alabama 
2	blow blow blow 
2	blow up sea winds along paumanok s shore 
2	i wait and i wait till you blow my mate to me 
2	yes when the stars glisten d 
2	all night long on the prong of a moss scallop d stake 
2	down almost amid the slapping waves 
2	sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears 
2	he call d on his mate 
2	he pour d forth the meanings which i of all men know 
2	yes my brother i know 
2	the rest might not but i have treasur d every note 
2	for more than once dimly down to the beach gliding 
2	silent avoiding the moonbeams blending myself with the shadows 
2	the white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing

2	listen d long and long 
2	listen d to keep to sing now translating the notes 
2	following you my brother 
2	soothe soothe soothe 
2	close on its wave soothes the wave behind 
2	and again another behind embracing and lapping every one close 
2	but my love soothes not me not me 
2	low hangs the moon it rose late 
2	it is lagging o i think it is heavy with love with love 
2	o madly the sea pushes upon the land 
2	with love with love 
2	o night do i not see my love fluttering out among the breakers 
2	what is that little black thing i see there in the white 
2	loud loud loud 
2	loud i call to you my love 
2	high and clear i shoot my voice over the waves 
2	surely you must know who is here is here 
2	you must know who i am my love 
2	low hanging moon 
2	what is that dusky spot in your brown yellow 
2	o it is the shape the shape of my mate 
2	o moon do not keep her from me any longer 
2	land land o land 
2	for i am almost sure i see her dimly whichever way i look 
2	o rising stars 
2	o throat o trembling throat 
2	sound clearer through the atmosphere 
2	pierce the woods the earth 
2	somewhere listening to catch you must be the one i want 
2	shake out carols 
2	solitary here the night s carols 
2	carols of lonesome love death s carols 
2	carols under that lagging yellow waning moon 
2	o under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea 
2	o reckless despairing carols 
2	but soft sink low 
2	soft let me just murmur 
2	and do you wait a moment you husky nois d sea 
2	for somewhere i believe i heard my mate responding to me 
2	so faint i must be still be still to listen 
2	hither my love 
2	here i am here 
2	with this just sustain d note i announce myself to you 
2	this gentle call is for you my love for you 
2	do not be decoy d elsewhere 
2	that is the whistle of the wind it is not my voice 
2	that is the fluttering the fluttering of the spray 
2	those are the shadows of leaves 
2	o darkness o in vain 
2	o i am very sick and sorrowful
2	o brown halo in the sky near the moon drooping upon the sea 
2	o troubled reflection in the sea 
2	o throat o throbbing heart 
2	and i singing uselessly uselessly all the night 
2	o past o happy life o songs of joy 
2	in the air in the woods over fields 
2	loved loved loved loved loved 
2	but my mate no more no more with me 
2	we two together no more 
2	the aria sinking 
2	all else continuing the stars shining 
2	the winds blowing the notes of the bird continuous echoing 
2	with angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning 
2	on the sands of paumanok s shore gray and rustling 
2	the boy ecstatic with his bare feet the waves with his hair the
2	the aria s meaning the ears the soul swiftly depositing 
2	the strange tears down the cheeks coursing 
2	the colloquy there the trio each uttering 
2	the undertone the savage old mother incessantly crying 
2	demon or bird said the boy s soul 
2	is it indeed toward your mate you sing or is it really to me 
2	and already a thousand singers a thousand songs clearer louder
2	o you singer solitary singing by yourself projecting me 
2	never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me 
2	never again leave me to be the peaceful child i was before what
2	there in the night 
2	by the sea under the yellow and sagging moon 
2	the messenger there arous d the fire the sweet hell within 
2	the unknown want the destiny of me 
2	o give me the clue it lurks in the night here somewhere 
2	o if i am to have so much let me have more 
2	a word then for i will conquer it 
2	the word final superior to all 
2	subtle sent up what is it i listen 
2	are you whispering it and have been all the time you sea waves 
2	whereto answering the sea 
2	delaying not hurrying not 
2	whisper d me through the night and very plainly before daybreak 
2	and again death death death death
2	which i do not forget 
2	but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother 
2	that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanok s gray beach 
2	with the thousand responsive songs at random 
2	my own songs awaked from that hour 
2	and with them the key the word up from the waves 
2	the word of the sweetest song and all songs 
2	that strong and delicious word which creeping to my feet 
2	 or like some old crone rocking the cradle swathed in sweet
2	garments bending aside 
2	the sea whisper d me 
2	as i ebb d with the ocean of life
2	as i ebb d with the ocean of life 
2	as i wended the shores i know 
2	as i walk d where the ripples continually wash you paumanok 
2	where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant 
2	where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways 
2	i musing late in the autumn day gazing off southward 
2	chaff straw splinters of wood weeds and the sea gluten 
2	as i wended the shores i know 
2	as i walk d with that electric self seeking types 
2	as i wend to the shores i know not 
2	as i list to the dirge the voices of men and women wreck d 
2	as i inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me 
2	as the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer 
2	i too but signify at the utmost a little wash d up drift 
2	a few sands and dead leaves to gather 
2	gather and merge myself as part of the sands and drift 
2	o baffled balk d bent to the very earth 
2	oppress d with myself that i have dared to open my mouth 
2	but that before all my arrogant poems the real me stands yet
2	untouch d untold altogether unreach d 
2	i perceive i have not really understood any thing not a single
2	object and that no man ever can 
2	because i have dared to open my mouth to sing at all 
2	you oceans both i close with you

2	what joys what joys were thine 
2	aboard at a ship s helm
2	aboard at a ship s helm 
2	a young steersman steering with care 
2	through fog on a sea coast dolefully ringing 
2	an ocean bell o a warning bell rock d by the waves 
2	o you give good notice indeed you bell by the sea reefs ringing 
2	for as on the alert o steersman you mind the loud admonition 
2	away gayly and safe 
2	but o the ship the immortal ship o ship aboard the ship 
2	ship of the body ship of the soul voyaging voyaging voyaging 
2	on the beach at night 
2	stands a child with her father 
2	watching the east the autumn sky 
2	up through the darkness 
2	amid a transparent clear belt of ether yet left in the east 
2	ascends large and calm the lord star jupiter 
2	and nigh at hand only a very little above 
2	swim the delicate sisters the pleiades 
2	from the beach the child holding the hand of her father 
2	those burial clouds that lower victorious soon to devour all

2	considerest thou alone the burial of the stars 
2	something there is 
2	 with my lips soothing thee adding i whisper 
2	i give thee the first suggestion the problem and indirection 
2	something there is more immortal even than the stars 
2	 many the burials many the days and nights passing away 
2	something that shall endure longer even than lustrous jupiter
2	longer than sun or any revolving satellite 
2	or the radiant sisters the pleiades 
2	the world below the brine
2	the world below the brine 
2	forests at the bottom of the sea the branches and leaves 
2	sea lettuce vast lichens strange flowers and seeds the thick
2	tangle openings and pink turf 
2	sluggish existences grazing there suspended or slowly crawling
2	close to the bottom 
2	the leaden eyed shark the walrus the turtle the hairy
2	sea leopard and the sting ray 
2	on the beach at night alone 
2	as the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song 
2	a vast similitude interlocks all 
2	all spheres grown ungrown small large suns moons planets 
2	all distances of place however wide 
2	all distances of time all inanimate forms 
2	this vast similitude spans them and always has spann d 
2	and shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them 
2	to day a rude brief recitative 
2	far as the eye can reach 
2	of dashing spray and the winds piping and blowing 
2	and out of these a chant for the sailors of all nations 
2	fitful like a surge 
2	pick d sparingly without noise by thee old ocean chosen by thee

2	and all that went down doing their duty 
2	wild wild the storm and the sea high running 
2	steady the roar of the gale with incessant undertone muttering 
2	shouts of demoniac laughter fitfully piercing and pealing 
2	waves air midnight their savagest trinity lashing 
2	out in the shadows there milk white combs careering 
2	on beachy slush and sand spirts of snow fierce slanting 
2	where through the murk the easterly death wind breasting 
2	through cutting swirl and spray watchful and firm advancing 
2	steadily slowly through hoarse roar never remitting 
2	along the midnight edge by those milk white combs careering 
2	a group of dim weird forms struggling the night confronting 
2	that savage trinity warily watching 
2	after the sea ship after the whistling winds 
2	after the white gray sails taut to their spars and ropes 
2	below a myriad myriad waves hastening lifting up their necks 
2	tending in ceaseless flow toward the track of the ship 
2	waves of the ocean bubbling and gurgling blithely prying 
2	waves undulating waves liquid uneven emulous waves 
2	toward that whirling current laughing and buoyant with curves 
2	where the great vessel sailing and tacking displaced the surface 
2	a motley procession with many a fleck of foam and many fragments

2	and what does it say to me all the while 
2	nothing my babe you see in the sky 
2	and nothing at all to you it says but look you my babe 
2	how envied by all the earth 
2	fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high 
2	on floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels 
2	floating so buoyant with milk white foam on the waters 
2	but i am not the sea nor the red sun 
2	i am not the wind with girlish laughter 
2	which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land 
2	which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings 
2	o father it is alive it is full of people it has children 
2	o now it seems to me it is talking to its children 
2	i hear it it talks to me o it is wonderful 
2	o it stretches it spreads and runs so fast o my father 
2	it is so broad it covers the whole sky 
2	cease cease my foolish babe 
2	what you are saying is sorrowful to me much t displeases me 
2	speak to the child o bard out of manhattan 
2	to our children all or north or south of manhattan 
2	for what are we mere strips of cloth profiting nothing 
2	only flapping in the wind 
2	i hear and see not strips of cloth alone 
2	i hear the tramp of armies i hear the challenging sentry 
2	i hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men i hear liberty 
2	i hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing 
2	i myself move abroad swift rising flying then 
2	see the identity formed out of thirty eight spacious and haughty
2	states and many more to come 
2	see forts on the shores of harbors see ships sailing in and out 
2	runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance and now the halyards
2	side of my banner broad and blue side of my starry banner 
2	discarding peace over all the sea and land 
2	yet louder higher stronger bard yet farther wider cleave 
2	no longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone 
2	we may be terror and carnage and are so now 
2	not now are we any one of these spacious and haughty states nor
2	nor market nor depot we nor money bank in the city 
2	miles the capitals 
2	the forty millions of people o bard in life and death supreme 
2	o my father i like not the houses 
2	they will never to me be any thing nor do i like money 
2	child of mine you fill me with anguish 
2	to be that pennant would be too fearful 
2	little you know what it is this day and after this day forever 
2	with passions of demons slaughter premature death 
2	demons and death then i sing 
2	put in all aye all will i sword shaped pennant for war 
2	and the beach waves combing over the beach on my eastern shore 
2	and my western shore the same 
2	no more with tender lip nor musical labial sound 
2	my limbs my veins dilate my theme is clear at last 
2	not houses of peace indeed are you nor any nor all their
2	prosperity if need be you shall again have every one of those
2	houses to destroy them 
2	you thought not to destroy those valuable houses standing fast 
2	full of comfort built with money 
2	nor excellent stores nor landed on wharves from the ships 
2	not the superb ships with sail power or steam power fetching and
2	running up out of the night bringing your cluster of stars 
2	 ever enlarging stars 
2	divider of daybreak you cutting the air touch d by the sun 
2	measuring the sky 
2	 passionately seen and yearn d for by one poor little child 
2	while others remain busy or smartly talking forever teaching
2	thrift thrift 
2	owner of all o banner and pennant 
2	flapping up there in the wind 
2	rise o days from your fathomless deeps
2	i watch d with joy the threatening maws of the waves 
2	saw from below what arose and mounted o superb o wild as my
2	heart and powerful 
2	heard the continuous thunder as it bellow d after the lightning 
2	noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and
2	fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky 
2	all the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me 
2	yet there with my soul i fed i fed content supercilious 
2	 twas well o soul twas a good preparation you gave me 
2	now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill 
2	what to pavements and homesteads here what were those storms of
2	what to passions i witness around me to day was the sea risen 
2	was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds 
2	what was that swell i saw on the ocean behold what comes here 
2	how it climbs with daring feet and hands how it dashes 
2	how the true thunder bellows after the lightning how bright the
2	flashes of lightning 
2	how democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on shown
2	through the dark by those flashes of lightning 
2	thunder on stride on democracy strike with vengeful stroke 
2	and do you rise higher than ever yet o days o cities 
2	crash heavier heavier yet o storms you have done me good 
2	certainties suitable to me 
2	hungering hungering hungering for primal energies and nature s
2	i refresh d myself with it only i could relish it only 
2	but now i no longer wait i am fully satisfied i am glutted 
2	the noble sire fallen on evil days 
2	i saw with hand uplifted menacing brandishing 
2	 memories of old in abeyance love and faith in abeyance 
2	the noble son on sinewy feet advancing 
2	drest in blue bearing their trusty rifles on their shoulders 
2	then the mother of all with calm voice speaking 
2	when you yourself forever provide to defend me 
2	for you provided me washington and now these also 
2	city of ships 
2	 o the black ships o the fierce ships 
2	o the beautiful sharp bow d steam ships and sail ships 
2	city of the world for all races are here 
2	all the lands of the earth make contributions here 
2	city of the sea city of hurried and glittering tides 
2	behold me incarnate me as i have incarnated you 
2	in peace i chanted peace but now the drum of war is mine 
2	war red war is my song through your streets o city

2	the hill top is nigh but a few steps make room gentlemen 
2	up the path you have follow d me well spite of your hundred and
2	extra years 
2	you can walk old man though your eyes are almost done 
2	rest while i tell what the crowd around us means 
2	on the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising 
2	there is the camp one regiment departs to morrow 
2	do you hear the officers giving their orders 
2	do you hear the clank of the muskets 
2	why what comes over you now old man 
2	why do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively 
2	the troops are but drilling they are yet surrounded with smiles 
2	while splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down 
2	green the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze 
2	o er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between 
2	but drill and parade are over they march back to quarters 
2	only hear that approval of hands hear what a clapping 
2	as wending the crowds now part and disperse but we old man 
2	not for nothing have i brought you hither we must remain 
2	you to speak in your turn and i to listen and tell 
2	when i clutch d your hand it was not with terror 
2	but suddenly pouring about me here on every side 
2	over hills across lowlands and in the skirts of woods 
2	and along the shores in mire now fill d over came again and
2	suddenly raged 
2	walking then this hilltop this same ground 
2	aye this is the ground 
2	my blind eyes even as i speak behold it re peopled from graves 
2	the years recede pavements and stately houses disappear 
2	rude forts appear again the old hoop d guns are mounted 
2	i see the lines of rais d earth stretching from river to bay 
2	i mark the vista of waters i mark the uplands and slopes 
2	here we lay encamp d it was this time in summer also 
2	as i talk i remember all i remember the declaration 
2	it was read here the whole army paraded it was read to us here 
2	it glitter d in the sun in full sight of the army 
2	twas a bold act then the english war ships had just arrived 
2	we could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor 
2	and the transports swarming with soldiers 
2	a few days more and they landed and then the battle 
2	twenty thousand were brought against us 
2	a veteran force furnish d with good artillery 
2	i tell not now the whole of the battle 
2	of that brigade i tell and how steadily it march d 
2	and how long and well it stood confronting death 
2	the general watch d them from this hill 
2	they made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment 
2	it sickens me yet that slaughter 
2	i saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the general 
2	i saw how he wrung his hands in anguish 
2	we fought the fight in detachments 
2	till we turn d menacing here and then he left us 
2	few return d nearly all remain in brooklyn 
2	that and here my general s first battle 
2	no women looking on nor sunshine to bask in it did not conclude
2	with applause 
2	nobody clapp d hands here then 
2	but in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain 
2	wearied that night we lay foil d and sullen 
2	so dull and damp and another day 
2	but the night of that mist lifting rain ceasing 
2	silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him my
2	general retreated 
2	i saw him at the river side 
2	down by the ferry lit by torches hastening the embarcation 
2	every one else seem d fill d with gloom 
2	many no doubt thought of capitulation 
2	but when my general pass d me 
2	as he stood in his boat and look d toward the coming sun 
2	i saw something different from capitulation 
2	enough the centenarian s story ends 
2	the two the past and present have interchanged 
2	and is this the ground washington trod 
2	i must copy the story and send it eastward and westward 
2	i must preserve that look as it beam d on you rivers of brooklyn 
2	see as the annual round returns the phantoms return 
2	it is the th of august and the british have landed 
2	the battle begins and goes against us behold through the smoke
2	washington s face 
2	baptized that day in many a young man s bloody wounds 
2	in death defeat and sisters mothers tears 
2	in the midst of you stands an encampment very old 
2	stands forever the camp of that dead brigade 
2	a line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands 
2	the guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind 
2	i see before me now a traveling army halting 
2	breaking out the eternal stars 
2	with its cloud of skirmishers in advance 
2	the swarming ranks press on and on the dense brigades press on 
2	glittering dimly toiling under the sun the dust cover d men 
2	in columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground 
2	with artillery interspers d the wheels rumble the horses sweat 
2	by the bivouac s fitful flame
2	by the bivouac s fitful flame 
2	a procession winding around me solemn and sweet and slow but
2	first i note 
2	like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving 
2	a solemn and slow procession there as i sit on the ground 
2	by the bivouac s fitful flame 
2	come up from the fields father
2	come up from the fields father here s a letter from our pete 
2	lo tis autumn 
2	lo where the trees deeper green yellower and redder 
2	cool and sweeten ohio s villages with leaves fluttering in the
2	moderate wind 
2	smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing 
2	down in the fields all prospers well 
2	but now from the fields come father come at the daughter s call 
2	open the envelope quickly 
2	o this is not our son s writing yet his name is sign d 
2	sentences broken gunshot wound in the breast cavalry skirmish 
2	taken to hospital 
2	at present low but will soon be better 
2	ah now the single figure to me 
2	amid all teeming and wealthy ohio with all its cities and farms 
2	sickly white in the face and dull in the head very faint 
2	by the jamb of a door leans 
2	the little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay d 
2	see dearest mother the letter says pete will soon be better 
2	alas poor boy he will never be better nor may be needs to be
2	better that brave and simple soul 
2	while they stand at home at the door he is dead already 
2	the only son is dead 
2	but the mother needs to be better 
2	she with thin form presently drest in black 
2	vigil strange i kept on the field one night 
2	when you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day 
2	one look i but gave which your dear eyes return d with a look i
2	shall never forget 
2	responding kisses never again on earth responding 
2	long there and then in vigil i stood dimly around me the
2	battlefield spreading 
2	passing sweet hours immortal and mystic hours with you dearest
2	comrade not a tear not a word 
2	folded the blanket well tucking it carefully over head and
2	carefully under feet 
2	and there and then and bathed by the rising sun my son in his
2	grave in his rude dug grave i deposited 
2	a march in the ranks hard prest and the road unknown 
2	a route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness 
2	clouds of smoke 
2	at my feet more distinctly a soldier a mere lad in danger of
2	bleeding to death he is shot in the abdomen 
2	the unknown road still marching 
2	a sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim 
2	as from my tent i emerge so early sleepless 
2	gray and heavy blanket folding covering all 
2	curious i halt and silent stand 
2	then with light fingers i from the face of the nearest the first
2	just lift the blanket 
2	who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim with well gray d hair 
2	who are you my dear comrade 
2	then to the second i step and who are you my child and darling 
2	who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming 
2	then to the third a face nor child nor old very calm as of
2	beautiful yellow white ivory 
2	dead and divine and brother of all and here again he lies 
2	as toilsome i wander d virginia s woods
2	as toilsome i wander d virginia s woods 
2	mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat easily all could
2	understand 
2	bold cautious true and my loving comrade 
2	long long i muse then on my way go wandering 
2	many a changeful season to follow and many a scene of life 
2	bold cautious true and my loving comrade 
2	not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port 
2	though beaten back and many times baffled 
2	not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long 
2	by deserts parch d snows chill d rivers wet perseveres till he
2	more than i have charged myself heeded or unheeded to compose
2	march for these states 
2	year that trembled and reel d beneath me
2	year that trembled and reel d beneath me 
2	must i change my triumphant songs said i to myself 
2	must i indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled 
2	and sullen hymns of defeat 
2	an old man bending i come among new faces 
2	years looking backward resuming in answer to children 
2	come tell us old man as from young men and maidens that love me 
2	of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us 
2	what stays with you latest and deepest of curious panics 
2	o maidens and young men i love and that love me 
2	soldiers joys 
2	but in silence in dreams projections 
2	while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on 
2	bearing the bandages water and sponge 
2	straight and swift to my wounded i go 
2	where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in 
2	where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground 
2	to each and all one after another i draw near not one do i miss 
2	i onward go i stop 
2	with hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds 
2	i am firm with each the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable 
2	one turns to me his appealing eyes poor boy i never knew you 
2	on on i go open doors of time open hospital doors 
2	 come sweet death be persuaded o beautiful death 
2	in mercy come quickly

2	but a day or two more for see the frame all wasted and sinking 
2	and the yellow blue countenance see

2	cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene so sickening 
2	i am faithful i do not give out 
2	the fractur d thigh the knee the wound in the abdomen 
2	thus in silence in dreams projections 
2	returning resuming i thread my way through the hospitals 
2	the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand 
2	i sit by the restless all the dark night some are so young 
2	some suffer so much i recall the experience sweet and sad

2	manhattan faces and eyes forever for me 
2	the last sunbeam
2	lightly falls from the finish d sabbath 
2	on the pavement here and there beyond it is looking 
2	down a new made double grave 
2	lo the moon ascending 
2	up from the east the silvery round moon 
2	beautiful over the house tops ghastly phantom moon 
2	immense and silent moon 
2	i see a sad procession 
2	and i hear the sound of coming full key d bugles 
2	all the channels of the city streets they re flooding 
2	as with voices and with tears 
2	i hear the great drums pounding 
2	and the small drums steady whirring 
2	and every blow of the great convulsive drums 
2	strikes me through and through 
2	for the son is brought with the father 
2	 in the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell 
2	two veterans son and father dropt together 
2	and the double grave awaits them 
2	now nearer blow the bugles 
2	and the drums strike more convulsive 
2	and the daylight o er the pavement quite has faded 
2	and the strong dead march enwraps me 
2	in the eastern sky up buoying 
2	the sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin d 
2	 tis some mother s large transparent face 
2	in heaven brighter growing 
2	o strong dead march you please me

2	sings by himself a song 
2	song of the bleeding throat 
2	death s outlet song of life for well dear brother i know

2	but a moment i linger for the lustrous star has detain d me 
2	the star my departing comrade holds and detains me 
2	o how shall i warble myself for the dead one there i loved 
2	sea winds blown from east and west 
2	blown from the eastern sea and blown from the western sea till
2	there on the prairies meeting 
2	these and with these and the breath of my chant 
2	i ll perfume the grave of him i love 
2	o what shall i hang on the chamber walls

2	sing on dearest brother warble your reedy song 
2	loud human song with voice of uttermost woe 
2	o liquid and free and tender 
2	o wild and loose to my soul o wondrous singer 
2	you only i hear yet the star holds me but will soon depart 
2	yet the lilac with mastering odor holds me 
2	now while i sat in the day and look d forth 
2	the many moving sea tides and i saw the ships how they sail d 
2	and the summer approaching with richness and the fields all busy
2	and the infinite separate houses how they all went on each with
2	and i knew death its thought and the sacred knowledge of death 
2	then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me 
2	and the thought of death close walking the other side of me 
2	i fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not 
2	and the singer so shy to the rest receiv d me 
2	the gray brown bird i know receiv d us comrades three 
2	and he sang the carol of death and a verse for him i love 
2	from deep secluded recesses 
2	from the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still 
2	came the carol of the bird 
2	and the charm of the carol rapt me 
2	as i held as if by their hands my comrades in the night 
2	and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird 
2	come lovely and soothing death

2	the night in silence under many a star 
2	the ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice i know 
2	and the body gratefully nestling close to thee 
2	over the tree tops i float thee a song 
2	over the rising and sinking waves over the myriad fields and the
2	to the tally of my soul 
2	loud and strong kept up the gray brown bird 
2	with pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night 
2	loud in the pines and cedars dim 
2	clear in the freshness moist and the swamp perfume 
2	and i with my comrades there in the night 
2	while my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed 
2	as to long panoramas of visions 
2	and i saw askant the armies 
2	i saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle flags 
2	i saw battle corpses myriads of them 
2	and the white skeletons of young men i saw them 
2	i saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war 
2	they themselves were fully at rest they suffer d not 
2	the living remain d and suffer d the mother suffer d 
2	and the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer d 
2	and the armies that remain d suffer d

2	passing i leave thee lilac with heart shaped leaves 
2	i cease from my song for thee 
2	yet each to keep and all retrievements out of the night 
2	the song the wondrous chant of the gray brown bird 
2	and the tallying chant the echo arous d in my soul 
2	lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul 
2	there in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim 
2	o captain my captain our fearful trip is done 
2	the ship has weather d every rack the prize we sought is won 
2	the port is near the bells i hear the people all exulting 
2	while follow eyes the steady keel the vessel grim and daring

2	a phantom gigantic superb with stern visage accosted me

2	chant me the carol of victory 
2	and strike up the marches of libertad marches more powerful yet 
2	a nation announcing itself 
2	i myself make the only growth by which i can be appreciated 
2	i reject none accept all then reproduce all in my own forms 
2	a breed whose proof is in time and deeds 
2	what we are we are nativity is answer enough to objections 
2	we wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded 
2	we are powerful and tremendous in ourselves

2	of these states the poet is the equable man 
2	nothing out of its place is good nothing in its place is bad 
2	he bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion neither
2	he is the arbiter of the diverse he is the key

2	immortality government 
2	in war he is the best backer of the war he fetches artillery as
2	helpless thing 
2	as he sees the farthest he has the most faith 
2	his thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things 
2	in the dispute on god and eternity he is silent 
2	he sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement 
2	as dreams or dots 
2	for the great idea the idea of perfect and free individuals 
2	for that the bard walks in advance leader of leaders 
2	without extinction is liberty without retrograde is equality

2	o earth that hast no voice confide to me a voice 
2	o harvest of my lands o boundless summer growths 
2	o lavish brown parturient earth o infinite teeming womb 
2	a song to narrate thee 
2	ever upon this stage 
2	is acted god s calm annual drama 
2	gorgeous processions songs of birds 
2	sunrise that fullest feeds and freshens most the soul 
2	the liliput countless armies of the grass 
2	the heat the showers the measureless pasturages 
2	the scenery of the snows the winds free orchestra 
2	the high dilating stars the placid beckoning stars 
2	the moving flocks and herds the plains and emerald meadows 
2	fecund america today 
2	thou art all over set in births and joys 
2	thou envy of the globe thou miracle 
2	thou bathed choked swimming in plenty 
2	thou lucky mistress of the tranquil barns 
2	thou prairie dame that sittest in the middle and lookest out upon
2	dispensatress that by a word givest a thousand miles a million
2	farms and missest nothing 
2	when late i sang sad was my voice 
2	sad were the shows around me with deafening noises of hatred and
2	smoke of war 
2	in the midst of the conflict the heroes i stood 
2	or pass d with slow step through the wounded and dying 
2	but now i sing not war 
2	nor the measur d march of soldiers nor the tents of camps 
2	nor the regiments hastily coming up deploying in line of battle 
2	no more the sad unnatural shows of war 
2	 pass pass ye proud brigades with your tramping sinewy legs 
2	pass then rattle drums again 
2	for an army heaves in sight o another gathering army 
2	swarming trailing on the rear o you dread accruing army 
2	lo your pallid army follows 
2	but on these days of brightness 
2	should the dead intrude 
2	ah the dead to me mar not they fit well in nature 
2	they fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass 
2	and along the edge of the sky in the horizon s far margin 
2	nor do i forget you departed 
2	nor in winter or summer my lost ones 
2	your memories rising glide silently by me 
2	i saw the day the return of the heroes 
2	 yet the heroes never surpass d shall never return 
2	them that day i saw not 
2	i saw the interminable corps i saw the processions of armies 
2	i saw them approaching defiling by with divisions 
2	no holiday soldiers youthful yet veterans 
2	inured on many a hard fought bloody field 
2	a pause the armies wait 
2	a million flush d embattled conquerors wait 
2	exult o lands victorious lands 
2	not there your victory on those red shuddering fields 
2	but here and hence your victory 
2	melt melt away ye armies disperse ye blue clad soldiers 
2	resolve ye back again give up for good your deadly arms 
2	other the arms the fields henceforth for you or south or north 
2	with saner wars sweet wars life giving wars 
2	loud o my throat and clear o soul 
2	the season of thanks and the voice of full yielding 
2	the chant of joy and power for boundless fertility 
2	all till d and untill d fields expand before me 
2	i see the true arenas of my race or first or last 
2	man s innocent and strong arenas 
2	i see the heroes at other toils 
2	i see well wielded in their hands the better weapons 
2	i see where the mother of all 
2	with full spanning eye gazes forth dwells long 
2	and counts the varied gathering of the products 
2	busy the far the sunlit panorama 
2	prairie orchard and yellow grain of the north 
2	cotton and rice of the south and louisianian cane 
2	open unseeded fallows rich fields of clover and timothy 
2	kine and horses feeding and droves of sheep and swine 
2	and many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook 
2	and healthy uplands with herby perfumed breezes

2	not alone on those warlike fields the mother of all 
2	with dilated form and lambent eyes watch d you

2	the mother of all yet here as ever she watches you 
2	well pleased america thou beholdest 
2	over the fields of the west those crawling monsters 
2	the human divine inventions the labor saving implements 
2	beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the
2	revolving hay rakes 
2	the steam power reaping machines and the horse power machines
2	the engines thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain well
2	separating the straw the nimble work of the patent pitchfork 
2	beholdest the newer saw mill the southern cotton gin and the
2	rice cleanser 
2	beneath thy look o maternal 
2	all gather and all harvest 
2	gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns

2	and the first object he look d upon that object he became 
2	the early lilacs became part of this child 
2	and grass and white and red morning glories and white and red
2	clover and the song of the phoebe bird 
2	esculent roots of the garden 
2	and the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the
2	tavern whence he had lately risen 
2	and the schoolmistress that pass d on her way to the school 
2	and the friendly boys that pass d and the quarrelsome boys 
2	they gave this child more of themselves than that 
2	they gave him afterward every day they became part of him 
2	odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by 
2	yearning and swelling heart 
2	the doubts of day time and the doubts of night time the curious
2	whether and how

2	boat slack tow d astern 
2	the hurrying tumbling waves quick broken crests slapping 
2	the strata of color d clouds the long bar of maroon tint away
2	solitary by itself the spread of purity it lies motionless in 
2	these became part of that child who went forth every day and who
2	far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty 
2	crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother 
2	once a queen now lean and tatter d seated on the ground 
2	her old white hair drooping dishevel d round her shoulders 
2	at her feet fallen an unused royal harp 
2	yet a word ancient mother

2	something startles me where i thought i was safest

2	how can you be alive you growths of spring

2	where have you disposed of their carcasses 
2	those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations 
2	where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat 
2	i do not see any of it upon you to day or perhaps i am deceiv d 
2	i am sure i shall expose some of the foul meat

2	the delicate spear of the onion pierces upward 
2	the apple buds cluster together on the apple branches 
2	the young of poultry break through the hatch d eggs 
2	what chemistry 
2	that the winds are really not infectious 
2	themselves in it 
2	that all is clean forever and forever 
2	that the cool drink from the well tastes so good 
2	that blackberries are so flavorous and juicy 
2	that the fruits of the apple orchard and the orange orchard that
2	that when i recline on the grass i do not catch any disease 
2	though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once
2	catching disease 
2	now i am terrified at the earth it is that calm and patient 
2	it grows such sweet things out of such corruptions 
2	it turns harmless and stainless on its axis with such endless
2	successions of diseas d corpses 
2	it distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor

2	waiting patiently waiting its time 
2	 not songs of loyalty alone are these 
2	but songs of insurrection also 
2	for i am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over 
2	and he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him 
2	and stakes his life to be lost at any moment 
2	the prison scaffold garrote handcuffs iron necklace and
2	leadballs do their work

2	infidel enter d into full possession 
2	it waits for all the rest to go it is the last 
2	when there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs 
2	then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from
2	and the infidel come into full possession 
2	then courage european revolter revoltress 
2	for till all ceases neither must you cease 
2	but i will search carefully for it even in being foil d 
2	did we think victory great 
2	so it is but now it seems to me when it cannot be help d that
2	defeat is great 
2	and that death and dismay are great

2	travel d their course and pass d on 
2	what histories rulers heroes perhaps transcending all others 
2	what laws customs wealth arts traditions 
2	not a mark not a record remains and yet all remains 
2	o i know that those men and women were not for nothing any more
2	than we are for nothing 
2	afar they stand yet near to me they stand 
2	some with oval countenances learn d and calm 
2	some naked and savage some like huge collections of insects 
2	some in tents herdsmen patriarchs tribes horsemen 
2	some prowling through woods some living peaceably on farms 
2	laboring reaping filling barns 
2	some traversing paved avenues amid temples palaces factories 
2	libraries shows courts theatres wonderful monuments 
2	are those billions of men really gone 
2	are those women of the old experience of the earth gone 
2	do their lives cities arts rest only with us 
2	did they achieve nothing for good for themselves 
2	i believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of
2	them any more than this shall be the end of my nation or of me 
2	games wars manners crimes prisons slaves heroes poets 
2	i suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world

2	all that a person does says thinks is of consequence 
2	but the same affects him or her onward afterward through the

2	power to speak words 
2	do you move in these broad lands as broad as they 
2	come duly to the divine power to speak words 
2	for only at last after many years after chastity friendship 
2	procreation prudence and nakedness 
2	after treading ground and breasting river and lake 
2	after complete faith after clarifyings elevations and removing
2	after these and more it is just possible there comes to a man 
2	woman the divine power to speak words 
2	then toward that man or that woman swiftly hasten all none
2	refuse all attend 
2	close ranks 
2	they debouch as they are wanted to march obediently through the

2	o what is it in me that makes me tremble so at voices 
2	all waits for the right voices 
2	i see brains and lips closed tympans and temples unstruck 
2	until that comes which has the quality to strike and to unclose 
2	until that comes which has the quality to bring forth what lies
2	slumbering forever ready in all words 
2	my spirit to yours dear brother 
2	i specify you with joy o my comrade to salute you and to salute
2	those who are with you before and since and those to come also 
2	we walk silent among disputes and assertions but reject not the
2	disputers nor any thing that is asserted 
2	we hear the bawling and din we are reach d at by divisions 
2	jealousies recriminations on every side 
2	they close peremptorily upon us to surround us my comrade 
2	yet we walk unheld free the whole earth over journeying up and
2	ages to come may prove brethren and lovers as we are 
2	you felons on trial in courts

2	o culpable i acknowledge i expose 
2	 o admirers praise not me compliment not me you make me wince 
2	inside these breast bones i lie smutch d and choked 
2	i walk with delinquents with passionate love 
2	laws for creations 
2	for strong artists and leaders for fresh broods of teachers and
2	perfect literats for america 
2	for noble savans and coming musicians 
2	all must have reference to the ensemble of the world and the
2	compact truth of the world 
2	what do you suppose creation is 
2	and that there is no god any more divine than yourself 
2	and that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean 
2	be composed be at ease with me i am walt whitman liberal and
2	lusty as nature 
2	not till the sun excludes you do i exclude you 
2	not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to
2	rustle for you do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you 
2	and i charge you that you be patient and perfect till i come 
2	i was looking a long while for intentions 
2	for a clew to the history of the past for myself and for these
2	chants and now i have found it 
2	it is not in those paged fables in the libraries them i neither
2	it is no more in the legends than in all else 
2	it is in the present it is this earth to day 
2	it is in democracy the purport and aim of all the past 
2	it is in the broad show of artificial things ships machinery 
2	of persons arrived at high positions ceremonies wealth 
2	scholarships and the like 
2	so that often to me they appear gaunt and naked 
2	and often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true
2	realities of life and go toward false realities 
2	and often to me they are alive after what custom has served them 
2	why who makes much of a miracle 
2	as to me i know of nothing else but miracles 
2	whether i walk the streets of manhattan 
2	or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky 
2	or talk by day with any one i love or sleep in the bed at night
2	with any one i love 
2	or sit at table at dinner with the rest 
2	or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car 
2	or watch honey bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon 
2	or animals feeding in the fields 
2	or birds or the wonderfulness of insects in the air 
2	or the wonderfulness of the sundown or of stars shining so quiet
2	or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring 
2	these with the rest one and all are to me miracles 
2	the whole referring yet each distinct and in its place 
2	to me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle 
2	every cubic inch of space is a miracle 
2	to me the sea is a continual miracle 
2	the fishes that swim the rocks the motion of the waves the
2	ships with men in them 
2	what stranger miracles are there 
2	sparkles from the wheel
2	where the city s ceaseless crowd moves on the livelong day 
2	by the curb toward the edge of the flagging 
2	a knife grinder works at his wheel sharpening a great knife 
2	forth issue then in copious golden jets 
2	sparkles from the wheel 
2	the scene and all its belongings how they seize and affect me 
2	the sad sharp chinn d old man with worn clothes and broad
2	shoulder band of leather 
2	myself effusing and fluid a phantom curiously floating now here
2	the group an unminded point set in a vast surrounding 
2	sparkles from the wheel 
2	is reform needed is it through you 
2	you do you not see how it would serve to have eyes blood 
2	complexion clean and sweet 
2	o the magnet the flesh over and over 
2	elevatedness 
2	unfolded out of the folds of the woman man comes unfolded and is
2	form d of perfect body 
2	unfolded only out of the inimitable poems of woman can come the
2	poems of man only thence have my poems come 
2	unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman i love only thence
2	unfolded by brawny embraces from the well muscled woman
2	love only thence come the brawny embraces of the man 
2	unfolded out of the folds of the woman s brain come all the folds
2	unfolded out of the justice of the woman all justice is unfolded 
2	a man is a great thing upon the earth and through eternity but
2	every of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman 
2	what am i after all but a child pleas d with the sound of my own
2	i stand apart to hear it never tires me 
2	to you your name also 
2	who includes diversity and is nature 
2	or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing

2	it is no small matter this round and delicious globe moving so
2	exactly in its orbit for ever and ever without one jolt or
2	the untruth of a single second 
2	i do not think seventy years is the time of a man or woman 
2	nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a man or woman 
2	and pass d from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of
2	summers and winters to articulate and walk all this is
2	equally wonderful 
2	and that my soul embraces you this hour and we affect each other
2	each other is every bit as wonderful 
2	and that i can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful

2	island sixteen miles long solid founded 
2	tides swift and ample well loved by me toward sundown 
2	the flowing sea currents the little islands larger adjoining

2	costless vouchsafed to each yet never man the owner 
2	which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme historians in prose 
2	which sculptor never chisel d yet nor painter painted 
2	which vocalist never sung nor orator nor actor ever utter d 
2	invoking here and now i challenge for my song 
2	indifferently mid public private haunts in solitude 
2	behind the mountain and the wood 
2	companion of the city s busiest streets through the assemblage 
2	it and its radiations constantly glide 
2	in looks of fair unconscious babes 
2	or strangely in the coffin d dead 
2	or show of breaking dawn or stars by night 
2	as some dissolving delicate film of dreams 
2	hiding yet lingering 
2	two little breaths of words comprising it 
2	two words yet all from first to last comprised in it 
2	how ardently for it 
2	how many ships have sail d and sunk for it 
2	how many travelers started from their homes and neer return d 
2	how much of genius boldly staked and lost for it 
2	what countless stores of beauty love ventur d for it 
2	how all superbest deeds since time began are traceable to it and
2	how all heroic martyrdoms to it 
2	how justified by it the horrors evils battles of the earth 
2	how the bright fascinating lambent flames of it in every age and
2	haply god s riddle it so vague and yet so certain 
2	the soul for it and all the visible universe for it 
2	and heaven at last for it 
2	who has gone farthest for i would go farther

2	i know thee savage spirit we have communed together 
2	mine too such wild arrays for reasons of their own

2	they have remember d thee 
2	as i walk these broad majestic days of peace 
2	now thou stridest on yet perhaps in time toward denser wars 
2	around me i hear that eclat of the world politics produce 
2	the announcements of recognized things science 
2	the approved growth of cities and the spread of inventions 
2	i see the ships they will last a few years 
2	the vast factories with their foremen and workmen 
2	and hear the indorsement of all and do not object to it 
2	but i too announce solid things 
2	science ships politics cities factories are not nothing 
2	like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring 
2	triumphantly moving and grander heaving in sight 
2	they stand for realities all is as it should be 
2	then my realities 
2	what else is so real as mine 
2	the rapt promises and lumine of seers the spiritual world these
2	this is thy hour o soul thy free flight into the wordless 
2	away from books away from art the day erased the lesson done 
2	night sleep death and the stars 
2	as the time draws nigh glooming a cloud 
2	a dread beyond of i know not what darkens me 
2	i shall go forth 
2	suddenly cease 
2	o book o chants must all then amount to but this 
2	must we barely arrive at this beginning of us and yet it is
2	enough o soul 
2	o soul we have positively appear d that is enough 
2	years of the modern years of the unperform d 
2	your horizon rises i see it parting away for more august dramas 
2	i see freedom completely arm d and victorious and very haughty 
2	with law on one side and peace on the other 
2	a stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste 
2	what historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach 
2	i see men marching and countermarching by swift millions 
2	never was average man his soul more energetic more like a god 
2	his daring foot is on land and sea everywhere he colonizes the
2	pacific the archipelagoes 
2	with the steamship the electric telegraph the newspaper the
2	wholesale engines of war 
2	with these and the world spreading factories he interlinks all
2	geography all lands 
2	pierce it is full of phantoms 
2	unborn deeds things soon to be project their shapes around me 
2	your dreams o years how they penetrate through me i know not
2	whether i sleep or wake 
2	ashes of soldiers south or north 
2	as i muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought 
2	the war resumes again to my sense your shapes 
2	and again the advance of the armies 
2	noiseless as mists and vapors 
2	from their graves in the trenches ascending 
2	from cemeteries all through virginia and tennessee 
2	from every point of the compass out of the countless graves 
2	and silently gather round me 
2	now sound no note o trumpeters 
2	not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses 
2	my handsome tan faced horsemen what life what joy and pride 
2	with all the perils were yours 
2	nor you drummers neither at reveille at dawn 
2	faces so pale with wondrous eyes very dear gather closer yet 
2	draw close but speak not 
2	phantoms of countless lost 
2	invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions 
2	follow me ever desert me not while i live 
2	but sweet ah sweet are the dead with their silent eyes 
2	dearest comrades all is over and long gone 
2	but love is not over and what love o comrades 
2	perfume from battle fields rising up from the foetor arising 
2	perfume therefore my chant o love immortal love 
2	give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers 
2	shroud them embalm them cover them all over with tender pride 
2	perfume all make all wholesome 
2	make these ashes to nourish and blossom 
2	o love solve all fructify all with the last chemistry 
2	give me exhaustless make me a fountain 
2	of these years i sing 
2	how they pass and have pass d through convuls d pains as through
2	evil as well as good 
2	the vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one s self 
2	how the whirl the contest the wrestle of evil with good the
2	sounding and resounding keep on and on 
2	how america is the continent of glories and of the triumph of
2	freedom and of the democracies and of the fruits of society and
2	and how these of mine and of the states will in their turn be
2	convuls d and serve other parturitions and transitions 
2	serves 
2	of seeds dropping into the ground of births

2	gray and heavy blanket folding covering all 
2	curious i halt and silent stand 
2	then with light fingers i from the face of the nearest the first
2	just lift the blanket 
2	who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim with well gray d hair

2	in the upward air where their eyes turn 
2	where the banner at daybreak is flapping 
2	words book words what are you 
2	words no more for hearken and see 
2	my song is there in the open air and i must sing 
2	with the banner and pennant a flapping

2	with the banner and pennant a flapping 
2	come up here bard bard 
2	come up here soul soul 
2	come up here dear little child 
2	father what is that in the sky beckoning to me with long finger 
2	and what does it say to me all the while 
2	nothing my babe you see in the sky 
2	and nothing at all to you it says but look you my babe 
2	look at these dazzling things in the houses and see you the
2	money shops opening 
2	these ah these how valued and toil d for these 
2	how envied by all the earth 
2	fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high 
2	on floats the sea in distant blue careering through its channels 
2	floating so buoyant with milk white foam on the waters 
2	but i am not the sea nor the red sun 
2	i am not the wind with girlish laughter 
2	which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land 
2	which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings 
2	aloft there flapping and flapping 
2	o father it is alive it is full of people it has children 
2	o now it seems to me it is talking to its children 
2	i hear it it talks to me o it is wonderful 
2	o it stretches it spreads and runs so fast o my father 
2	it is so broad it covers the whole sky 
2	cease cease my foolish babe 
2	what you are saying is sorrowful to me much it displeases me 
2	behold with the rest again i say behold not banners and pennants
2	but the well prepared pavements behold and mark the solid wall d
2	speak to the child o bard out of manhattan 
2	to our children all or north or south of manhattan 
2	point this day leaving all the rest to us over all and yet we
2	know not why 
2	for what are we mere strips of cloth profiting nothing 
2	only flapping in the wind 
2	i hear and see not strips of cloth alone 
2	i hear the tramp of armies i hear the challenging sentry 
2	i hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men i hear liberty 
2	i hear the drums beat and the trumpets blowing 
2	i myself move abroad swift rising flying then 
2	i see the stores depots of boston baltimore charleston new
2	i see far in the west the immense area of grain i dwell awhile
2	hovering 
2	side of my banner broad and blue side of my starry banner 
2	discarding peace over all the sea and land 
2	yet louder higher stronger bard yet farther wider cleave 
2	no longer let our children deem us riches and peace alone 
2	we may be terror and carnage and are so now 
2	nor market nor depot we nor money bank in the city 
2	over the area spread below the three or four millions of square
2	miles the capitals 
2	the forty millions of people o bard in life and death supreme 
2	we even we henceforth flaunt out masterful high up above 
2	o my father i like not the houses 
2	they will never to me be anything nor do i like money 
2	child of mine you fill me with anguish 
2	to be that pennant would be too fearful 
2	little you know what it is this day and after this day forever 
2	with passions of demons slaughter premature death 
2	demons and death then i sing 
2	put in all aye all will i sword shaped pennant for war 
2	and the black ships fighting on the sea envelop d in smoke 
2	and my illinois fields and my kansas fields and my fields of
2	fusing and holding claiming devouring the whole 
2	no more with tender lip nor musical labial sound 
2	my limbs my veins dilate my theme is clear at last 
2	i hear from above o pennant of war your ironical call and demand 
2	destroy them 
2	you thought not to destroy those valuable houses standing fast 
2	full of comfort built with money 
2	nor excellent stores nor landed on wharves from the ships 
2	not the superb ships with sail power or steam power fetching and
2	running up out of the night bringing your cluster of stars
2	 ever enlarging stars 
2	divider of daybreak you cutting the air touch d by the sun 
2	measuring the sky 
2	 passionately seen and yearn d for by one poor little child 
2	valueless object of eyes over all and demanding all absolute
2	owner of all o banner and pennant 
2	i too leave the rest great as it is it is nothing houses 
2	machines are nothing i see them not 
2	flapping up there in the wind 
2	 a long island incident early part of the nineteenth century 
2	amid these days of order ease prosperity 
2	amid the current songs of beauty peace decorum 
2	i cast a reminiscence likely t will offend you 
2	i heard it in my boyhood more than a generation since 
2	a queer old savage man a fighter under washington himself
2	revolutionary war 
2	lay dying sons daughters church deacons lovingly tending him 
2	 let me return again to my war days 
2	to the sights and scenes to forming the line of battle 
2	to the scouts ahead reconnoitering 
2	to the cannons the grim artillery 
2	to the galloping aids carrying orders 
2	to the wounded the fallen the heat the suspense 
2	the perfume strong the smoke the deafening noise 
2	away with your life of peace your joys of peace 
2	give me my old wild battle life again 
2	an old man bending i come among new faces 
2	years looking backward resuming in answer to children 
2	come tell us old man as from young men and maidens that love me
2	now be witness again paint the mightiest armies of earth 
2	of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us 
2	what stays with you latest and deepest of curious panics 
2	o maidens and young men i love and that love me 
2	soldiers joys
2	but in silence in dreams projections 
2	while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on 
2	bearing the bandages water and sponge 
2	straight and swift to my wounded i go 
2	where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in 
2	where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground 
2	to each and all one after another i draw near not one do i miss 
2	i onward go i stop 
2	with hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds 
2	i am firm with each the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable 
2	one turns to me his appealing eyes poor boy i never knew you 
2	on on i go open doors of time open hospital doors 
2	 come sweet death be persuaded o beautiful death 
2	in mercy come quickly 
2	from the stump of the arm the amputated hand 
2	and has not yet look d on it 
2	i dress a wound in the side deep deep 
2	but a day or two more for see the frame all wasted and sinking 
2	and the yellow blue countenance see 
2	i dress the perforated shoulder the foot with the bullet wound 
2	i am faithful i do not give out 
2	the fractur d thigh the knee the wound in the abdomen 
2	thus in silence in dreams projections 
2	returning resuming i thread my way through the hospitals 
2	the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand 
2	i sit by the restless all the dark night some are so young 
2	some suffer so much i recall the experience sweet and sad
2	the last sunbeam
2	lightly falls from the finish d sabbath 
2	on the pavement here and there beyond it is looking
2	down a new made double grave
2	lo the moon ascending 
2	up from the east the silvery round moon 
2	beautiful over the house tops ghastly phantom moon 
2	immense and silent moon 
2	i see a sad procession 
2	and i hear the sound of coming full key d bugles 
2	all the channels of the city streets they re flooding 
2	as with voices and with tears 
2	i hear the great drums pounding 
2	and the small drums steady whirring 
2	and every blow of the great convulsive drums 
2	strikes me through and through 
2	for the son is brought with the father
2	 in the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell 
2	two veterans son and father dropt together 
2	and the double grave awaits them 
2	now nearer blow the bugles 
2	and the drums strike more convulsive 
2	and the daylight over the pavement quite has faded 
2	and the strong dead march enwraps me 
2	in the eastern sky up buoying 
2	the sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin d
2	 tis some mother s large transparent face 
2	in heaven brighter growing 
2	o strong dead march you please me 
2	o moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me 
2	o my soldiers twain o my veterans passing to burial 
2	what i have i also give you 
2	the moon gives you light 
2	and the bugles and the drums give you music 
2	and my heart o my soldiers my veterans 
2	my heart gives you love

2	or pass d with slow step through the wounded and dying 
2	but now i sing not war

2	should the dead intrude 
2	ah the dead to me mar not they fit well in nature 
2	they fit very well in the landscape under the trees and grass

2	with every leaf a miracle and from this bush in the door yard 
2	in the swamp in secluded recesses 
2	a shy and hidden bird is warbling a song 
2	solitary the thrush 
2	the hermit withdrawn to himself avoiding the settlements 
2	sings by himself a song 
2	song of the bleeding throat 
2	death s outlet song of life for well dear brother i know 
2	if thou wast not granted to sing thou would st surely die 
2	over the breast of the spring the land amid cities 
2	amid lanes and through old woods where lately the violets peep d
2	amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes passing the
2	endless grass 
2	passing the apple tree blows of white and pink in the orchards 
2	carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave 
2	night and day journeys a coffin 
2	coffin that passes through lanes and streets 
2	through day and night with the great cloud darkening the land 
2	standing 
2	with processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the night 
2	strong and solemn 
2	with the tolling tolling bells perpetual clang

2	o singer bashful and tender i hear your notes i hear your call 
2	but a moment i linger for the lustrous star has detain d me 
2	the star my departing comrade holds and detains me 
2	o how shall i warble myself for the dead one there i loved 
2	sea winds blown from east and west 
2	blown from the eastern sea and blown from the western sea till
2	there on the prairies meeting 
2	these and with these and the breath of my chant 
2	i ll perfume the grave of him i love

2	and what shall the pictures be that i hang on the walls 
2	to adorn the burial house of him i love 
2	pictures of growing spring and farms and homes 
2	lo body and soul this land 
2	and ever the far spreading prairies cover d with grass and corn

2	o wild and loose to my soul o wondrous singer 
2	you only i hear yet the star holds me but will soon depart 
2	yet the lilac with mastering odour holds me 
2	now while i sat in the day and look d forth 
2	under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing and the
2	the many moving sea tides and i saw the ships how they sail d 
2	and the infinite separate houses how they all went on each with
2	and i knew death its thought and the sacred knowledge of death 
2	then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me 
2	and the thought of death close walking the other side of me 
2	i fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not 
2	and the singer so shy to the rest receiv d me 
2	the gray brown bird i know receiv d us comrades three 
2	and he sang the carol of death and a verse for him i love 
2	from deep secluded recesses 
2	from the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still 
2	came the carol of the bird 
2	and the charm of the carol rapt me 
2	as i held as if by their hands my comrades in the night 
2	and the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird 
2	 come lovely and soothing death 
2	undulate round the world serenely arriving arriving 
2	in the day in the night to all to each 
2	sooner or later delicate death 
2	 prais d be the fathomless universe 
2	for life and joy and for objects and knowledge curious 
2	and for love sweet love but praise praise praise 
2	for the sure enwinding arms of cool enfolding death 
2	 dark mother always gliding near with soft feet 
2	have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome

2	 approach strong deliveress 
2	laved in the flood of thy bliss o death 
2	 from me to thee glad serenades 
2	dances for thee i propose saluting thee adornments and feastings
2	and the sights of the open landscape and the high spread sky are
2	fitting 
2	and life and the fields and the huge and thoughtful night 
2	 the night in silence under many a star 
2	the ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice i know 
2	and the body gratefully nestling close to thee 
2	 over the tree tops i float thee a song 
2	over the rising and sinking waves over the myriad fields and the
2	to the tally of my soul 
2	loud and strong kept up the gray brown bird 
2	with pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night 
2	loud in the pines and cedars dim 
2	clear in the freshness moist and the swamp perfume 
2	and i with my comrades there in the night 
2	while my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed 
2	as to long panoramas of visions 
2	and i saw askant the armies 
2	i saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle flags 
2	i saw battle corpses myriads of them 
2	and the white skeletons of young men i saw them 
2	i saw the d bris and d bris of all the slain soldiers of the war 
2	they themselves were fully at rest they suffer d not 
2	the living remain d and suffer d the mother suffer d 
2	and the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer d 
2	and the armies that remain d suffer d 
2	passing the visions passing the night 
2	passing unloosing the hold of my comrades hands 
2	flooding the night 
2	sadly sinking and fainting as warning and warning and yet again
2	covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven 
2	as that powerful psalm in the night i heard from recesses 
2	passing i leave thee lilac with heart shaped leaves 
2	i cease from my song for thee 
2	o comrade lustrous with silver face in the night 
2	yet each to keep and all retrievements out of the night 
2	the song the wondrous chant of the gray brown bird 
2	and the tallying chant the echo arous d in my soul 
2	lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul 
2	there in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim 
2	o captain my captain our fearful trip is done 
2	the ship has weather d every rack the prize we sought is won 
2	the port is near the bells i hear the people all exulting 
2	while follow eyes the steady keel the vessel grim and daring

2	o the bleeding drops of red 
2	where on the deck my captain lies

2	impregnable 
2	surrounding the multiform agriculture mines temperature the
2	gestation of new states 
2	presence of superiors 
2	the prevailing ardour and enterprise the large amativeness 
2	manhattan firemen the yankee swap southern plantation life 
2	 lo high toward heaven this day 
2	libertad from the conqueress field return d 
2	i mark the new aureola around your head 
2	no more of soft astral but dazzling and fierce 
2	with war s flames and the lambent lightnings playing 
2	and your port immovable where you stand 
2	an offal rank to the dunghill maggots spurn d 
2	lead the present with friendly hand toward the future 
2	 bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age 
2	i listened to the phantom by ontario s shore 
2	i heard the voice arising demanding bards 
2	by them all native and grand by them alone can these states be
2	fused into the compact organism of a nation 
2	principle as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres
2	of plants 
2	the greatest 
2	 soul of love and tongue of fire 
2	eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world 
2	ah mother prolific and full in all besides yet how long barren 
2	of these states the poet is the equable man 
2	nothing out of its place is good nothing in its place is bad 
2	he bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion neither
2	he is the arbiter of the diverse he is the key 
2	he is the equalizer of his age and land 
2	he supplies what wants supplying he checks what wants checking 
2	government 
2	in war he is the best backer of the war he fetches artillery as
2	good as the engineer s he can make every word he speaks draw
2	blood 
2	as he sees the farthest he has the most faith 
2	his thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things 
2	in the dispute on god and eternity he is silent 
2	he sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and d nouement 
2	for the great idea the idea of perfect and free individuals 
2	for that the bard walks in advance leader of leaders 
2	without extinction is liberty without retrograde is equality 
2	they live in the feelings of young men and the best women
2	for the great idea 
2	that o my brethren that is the mission of poets 
2	songs of stern defiance ever ready 
2	songs of the rapid arming and the march 
2	the flag of peace quick folded and instead the flag we know 
2	warlike flag of the great idea 
2	 angry cloth i saw there leaping 
2	i stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting 
2	i sing you over all flying beckoning through the fight o the
2	hard contested fight 
2	hark the ringing word charge now the tussle and the furious
2	maddening yells 
2	now the corpses tumble curl d upon the ground 
2	cold cold in death for precious life of you 
2	angry cloth i saw there leaping 
2	the place is august the terms obdurate 
2	who are you indeed who would talk or sing to america 
2	have you studied out the land its idioms and men 
2	have you learn d the physiology phrenology politics geography 
2	objects 
2	have you consider d the organic compact of the first day of the
2	first year of independence sign d by the commissioners 
2	ratified by the states and read by washington at the head of
2	the army 
2	have you possess d yourself of the federal constitution 
2	have you sped through fleeting customs popularities 
2	are you not of some coterie some school or mere religion 
2	have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these states 
2	have you too the old ever fresh forbearance and impartiality 
2	what is this you bring my america 
2	is it uniform with my country 
2	is it not something that has been better told or done before 
2	have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship 
2	has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets politicians 
2	literats of enemies lands 
2	does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here 
2	does it answer universal needs will it improve manners 
2	can your performance face the open fields and the seaside 
2	does it meet modern discoveries calibres facts face to face 
2	what does it mean to american persons progresses cities 
2	does it see behind the apparent custodians the real custodians
2	standing menacing silent the mechanics manhattanese 
2	western men southerners significant alike in their apathy 
2	and in the promptness of their love 
2	who has ever ask d any thing of america 
2	what mocking and scornful negligence 
2	the track strew d with the dust of skeletons 
2	by the roadside others disdainfully toss d 
2	only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them 
2	 the proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr d till his country
2	absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorb d it 
2	he masters whose spirit masters he tastes sweetest who results
2	sweetest in the long run 
2	the blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint 
2	fall behind me states 
2	a man before all myself typical before all 
2	give me the pay i have served for 
2	give to sing the songs of the great idea take all the rest 
2	i have loved the earth sun animals i have despised riches 
2	read these leaves to myself in the open air tried them by trees 
2	dismiss d whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body 
2	claim d nothing to myself which i have not carefully claim d for
2	others on the same terms 
2	rejecting none permitting all 
2	 say o mother have i not to your thought been faithful 
2	have i not through life kept you and yours before me 
2	i swear i begin to see the meaning of these things 
2	it is not the earth it is not america who is so great 
2	underneath all individuals 
2	i swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals 
2	the american compact is altogether with individuals 
2	the only government is that which makes minute of individuals 
2	underneath all nativity 
2	men women cities nations are only beautiful from nativity 
2	underneath all is the expression of love for men and women
2	after this day i take my own modes of expressing love for men and
2	i swear i will have each quality of my race in myself
2	underneath the lessons of things spirits nature governments 
2	ownerships i swear i perceive other lessons 
2	o i see flashing that this america is only you and me 
2	its power weapons testimony are you and me 
2	its crimes lies thefts defections are you and me 
2	its endless gestations of new states are you and me 
2	the war that war so bloody and grim the war i will henceforth
2	forget was you and me 
2	natural and artificial are you and me 
2	freedom language forms employments are you and me 
2	past present future are you and me 
2	i dare not shirk any part of myself 
2	not any part of america good or bad 
2	not to build for that which builds for mankind 
2	not to balance ranks complexions creeds and the sexes 
2	not to justify science nor the march of equality 
2	nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belov d of time 
2	i am for those that have never been master d 
2	for men and women whose tempers have never been master d 
2	for those whom laws theories conventions can never master 
2	i am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth 
2	who inaugurate one to inaugurate all 
2	i will not be outfaced by irrational things 
2	i will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me 
2	i will make cities and civilizations defer to me 
2	 democracy while weapons were everywhere aim d at your breast 
2	saw you with spreading mantle covering the world 
2	i will confront these shows of the day and night 
2	i will know if i am to be less than they 
2	i will see if i am not as majestic as they 
2	i will see if i am not as subtle and real as they 
2	i will see if i am to be less generous than they 
2	i will see if i have no meaning while the houses and ships have
2	meaning 
2	i take you specially to be mine you terrible rude forms 
2	 mother bend down bend close to me your face 
2	i know not what these plots and wars and deferments are for 
2	thus by blue ontario s shore 
2	while the winds fann d me and the waves came trooping toward me 
2	i thrill d with the power s pulsations and the charm of my theme
2	till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me 
2	and i saw the free souls of poets 
2	the loftiest bards of past ages strode before me 
2	o my rapt verse my call mock me not 
2	not to call even those lofty bards here by ontario s shores 
2	have i sung so capricious and loud my savage song 
2	bards for my own land only i invoke
2	 for the war the war is over the field is clear d 
2	till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward 
2	to cheer o mother your boundless expectant soul 
2	stripes 
2	you by my charm i invoke 
2	rise o days from your fathomless deeps till you loftier fiercer
2	i watch d with joy the threatening maws of the waves 
2	heard the continuous thunder as it bellow d after the lightning 
2	all the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me 
2	yet there with my soul i fed i fed content supercilious 
2	 twas well o soul twas a good preparation you gave me 
2	now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill 
2	what to passions i witness around me to day was the sea risen 
2	was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds 
2	what was that swell i saw on the ocean behold what comes here 
2	how it climbs with daring feet and hands how it dashes 
2	how the true thunder bellows after the lightning how bright the
2	flashes of lightning 
2	thunder on stride on democracy strike with vengeful stroke 
2	and do you rise higher than ever yet o days o cities 
2	crash heavier heavier yet o storms you have done me good 
2	my soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong
2	nutriment 
2	one doubt nauseous undulating like a snake crawl d on the ground
2	the cities i loved so well i abandon d and left i sped to the
2	certainties suitable to me 
2	hungering hungering hungering for primal energies and nature s
2	i refresh d myself with it only i could relish it only 
2	but now i no longer wait i am fully satisfied i am glutted 
2	i have witness d the true lightning i have witness d my cities
2	electric 
2	i have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike america rise
