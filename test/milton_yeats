1	by one man s firm obedience fully tried
1	through all temptation and the tempter foiled
1	in all his wiles defeated and repulsed 
1	and eden raised in the waste wilderness 
1	thou spirit who led st this glorious eremite

1	with prosperous wing full summed to tell of deeds
1	above heroic though in secret done 
1	and unrecorded left through many an age 
1	worthy to have not remained so long unsung 
1	now had the great proclaimer with a voice
1	more awful than the sound of trumpet cried
1	repentance and heaven s kingdom nigh at hand
1	to all baptized to his great baptism flocked
1	with awe the regions round and with them came
1	from nazareth the son of joseph deemed
1	to the flood jordan came as then obscure 
1	unmarked unknown but him the baptist soon
1	descried divinely warned and witness bore
1	as to his worthier and would have resigned
1	to him his heavenly office nor was long
1	his witness unconfirmed on him baptized
1	heaven opened and in likeness of a dove
1	the spirit descended while the father s voice
1	from heaven pronounced him his beloved son 
1	that heard the adversary who roving still
1	about the world at that assembly famed
1	would not be last and with the voice divine
1	nigh thunder struck the exalted man to whom
1	such high attest was given a while surveyed
1	with wonder then with envy fraught and rage 
1	flies to his place nor rests but in mid air
1	to council summons all his mighty peers 
1	within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved 
1	a gloomy consistory and them amidst 
1	with looks aghast and sad he thus bespake 
1	 o ancient powers of air and this wide world
1	 for much more willingly i mention air 
1	this our old conquest than remember hell 
1	our hated habitation well ye know
1	how many ages as the years of men 
1	this universe we have possessed and ruled
1	in manner at our will the affairs of earth 
1	since adam and his facile consort eve
1	lost paradise deceived by me though since
1	with dread attending when that fatal wound
1	shall be inflicted by the seed of eve
1	upon my head long the decrees of heaven
1	delay for longest time to him is short 
1	and now too soon for us the circling hours
1	this dreaded time have compassed wherein we
1	must bide the stroke of that long threatened wound
1	 at least if so we can and by the head
1	broken be not intended all our power
1	to be infringed our freedom and our being
1	in this fair empire won of earth and air 
1	for this ill news i bring the woman s seed 
1	destined to this is late of woman born 
1	his birth to our just fear gave no small cause 
1	but his growth now to youth s full flower displaying
1	all virtue grace and wisdom to achieve
1	things highest greatest multiplies my fear 
1	before him a great prophet to proclaim
1	his coming is sent harbinger who all
1	invites and in the consecrated stream
1	pretends to wash off sin and fit them so
1	purified to receive him pure or rather
1	to do him honour as their king all come 
1	and he himself among them was baptized 
1	not thence to be more pure but to receive
1	the testimony of heaven that who he is
1	thenceforth the nations may not doubt i saw
1	the prophet do him reverence on him rising
1	out of the water heaven above the clouds
1	unfold her crystal doors thence on his head
1	a perfet dove descend whate er it meant 
1	and out of heaven the sovraign voice i heard 
1	 this is my son beloved in him am pleased 
1	his mother than is mortal but his sire
1	he who obtains the monarchy of heaven 
1	and what will he not do to advance his son 
1	his first begot we know and sore have felt 
1	when his fierce thunder drove us to the deep 
1	who this is we must learn for man he seems
1	in all his lineaments though in his face
1	the glimpses of his father s glory shine 
1	ye see our danger on the utmost edge
1	of hazard which admits no long debate 
1	but must with something sudden be opposed
1	 not force but well couched fraud well woven snares 
1	ere in the head of nations he appear 
1	their king their leader and supreme on earth 
1	i when no other durst sole undertook
1	the dismal expedition to find out
1	and ruin adam and the exploit performed
1	successfully a calmer voyage now
1	will waft me and the way found prosperous once
1	induces best to hope of like success 
1	he ended and his words impression left
1	of much amazement to the infernal crew 
1	distracted and surprised with deep dismay
1	at these sad tidings but no time was then
1	for long indulgence to their fears or grief 
1	unanimous they all commit the care
1	and management of this man enterprise
1	to him their great dictator whose attempt
1	at first against mankind so well had thrived
1	in adam s overthrow and led their march
1	from hell s deep vaulted den to dwell in light 
1	regents and potentates and kings yea gods 
1	of many a pleasant realm and province wide 
1	so to the coast of jordan he directs
1	his easy steps girded with snaky wiles 
1	where he might likeliest find this new declared 
1	this man of men attested son of god 
1	temptation and all guile on him to try 
1	so to subvert whom he suspected raised
1	to end his reign on earth so long enjoyed 
1	but contrary unweeting he fulfilled
1	the purposed counsel pre ordained and fixed 
1	of the most high who in full frequence bright
1	of angels thus to gabriel smiling spake 
1	 gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold 
1	thou and all angels conversant on earth
1	with man or men s affairs how i begin
1	to verify that solemn message late 
1	on which i sent thee to the virgin pure
1	in galilee that she should bear a son 
1	great in renown and called the son of god 
1	then told st her doubting how these things could be
1	to her a virgin that on her should come
1	the holy ghost and the power of the highest
1	o ershadow her this man born and now upgrown 
1	to shew him worthy of his birth divine
1	and high prediction henceforth i expose
1	to satan let him tempt and now assay
1	his utmost subtlety because he boasts
1	and vaunts of his great cunning to the throng
1	of his apostasy he might have learnt
1	less overweening since he failed in job 
1	whose constant perseverance overcame
1	whate er his cruel malice could invent 
1	he now shall know i can produce a man 
1	of female seed far abler to resist
1	all his solicitations and at length
1	all his vast force and drive him back to hell 
1	winning by conquest what the first man lost
1	by fallacy surprised but first i mean
1	to exercise him in the wilderness 
1	there he shall first lay down the rudiments
1	of his great warfare ere i send him forth
1	to conquer sin and death the two grand foes 
1	by humiliation and strong sufferance
1	his weakness shall o ercome satanic strength 
1	and all the world and mass of sinful flesh 
1	that all the angels and aethereal powers 
1	they now and men hereafter may discern
1	from what consummate virtue i have chose
1	this perfet man by merit called my son 
1	to earn salvation for the sons of men 
1	so spake the eternal father and all heaven
1	admiring stood a space then into hymns
1	burst forth and in celestial measures moved 
1	circling the throne and singing while the hand
1	sung with the voice and this the argument 
1	 victory and triumph to the son of god 
1	now entering his great duel not of arms 
1	but to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles 
1	the father knows the son therefore secure
1	ventures his filial virtue though untried 
1	against whate er may tempt whate er seduce 
1	allure or terrify or undermine 
1	be frustrate all ye stratagems of hell 
1	and devilish machinations come to nought 
1	so they in heaven their odes and vigils tuned 
1	meanwhile the son of god who yet some days
1	lodged in bethabara where john baptized 
1	musing and much revolving in his breast
1	how best the mighty work he might begin
1	of saviour to mankind and which way first
1	publish his godlike office now mature 
1	one day forth walked alone the spirit leading
1	and his deep thoughts the better to converse
1	with solitude till far from track of men 
1	thought following thought and step by step led on 
1	he entered now the bordering desert wild 
1	and with dark shades and rocks environed round 
1	his holy meditations thus pursued 
1	 o what a multitude of thoughts at once
1	awakened in me swarm while i consider
1	what from within i feel myself and hear
1	what from without comes often to my ears 
1	ill sorting with my present state compared 
1	when i was yet a child no childish play
1	to me was pleasing all my mind was set
1	serious to learn and know and thence to do 
1	what might be public good myself i thought
1	born to that end born to promote all truth 
1	all righteous things therefore above my years 
1	the law of god i read and found it sweet 
1	made it my whole delight and in it grew
1	to such perfection that ere yet my age
1	had measured twice six years at our great feast
1	i went into the temple there to hear
1	the teachers of our law and to propose
1	what might improve my knowledge or their own 
1	and was admired by all yet this not all
1	to which my spirit aspired victorious deeds
1	flamed in my heart heroic acts one while
1	to rescue israel from the roman yoke 
1	then to subdue and quell o er all the earth 
1	brute violence and proud tyrannic power 
1	till truth were freed and equity restored 
1	yet held it more humane more heavenly first
1	by winning words to conquer willing hearts 
1	and make persuasion do the work of fear 
1	at least to try and teach the erring soul 
1	not wilfully misdoing but unware
1	misled the stubborn only to subdue 
1	these growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving 
1	by words at times cast forth inly rejoiced 
1	and said to me apart high are thy thoughts 
1	o son but nourish them and let them soar
1	to what highth sacred virtue and true worth
1	can raise them though above example high 
1	by matchless deeds express thy matchless sire 
1	for know thou art no son of mortal man 
1	though men esteem thee low of parentage 
1	thy father is the eternal king who rules
1	all heaven and earth angels and sons of men 
1	a messenger from god foretold thy birth
1	conceived in me a virgin he foretold
1	thou shouldst be great and sit on david s throne 
1	and of thy kingdom there should be no end 
1	at thy nativity a glorious quire
1	of angels in the fields of bethlehem sung
1	to shepherds watching at their folds by night 
1	and told them the messiah now was born 
1	where they might see him and to thee they came 
1	directed to the manger where thou lay st 
1	for in the inn was left no better room 
1	a star not seen before in heaven appearing 
1	guided the wise men thither from the east 
1	to honour thee with incense myrrh and gold 
1	by whose bright course led on they found the place 
1	affirming it thy star new graven in heaven 
1	by which they knew thee king of israel born 
1	just simeon and prophetic anna warned
1	by vision found thee in the temple and spake 
1	before the altar and the vested priest 
1	like things of thee to all that present stood 
1	this having heart straight i again revolved
1	the law and prophets searching what was writ
1	concerning the messiah to our scribes
1	known partly and soon found of whom they spake
1	i am this chiefly that my way must lie
1	through many a hard assay even to the death 
1	ere i the promised kingdom can attain 
1	or work redemption for mankind whose sins 
1	full weight must be transferred upon my head 
1	yet neither thus disheartened or dismayed 
1	the time prefixed i waited when behold
1	the baptist of whose birth i oft had heard 
1	not knew by sight now come who was to come
1	before messiah and his way prepare 
1	i as all others to his baptism came 
1	which i believed was from above but he
1	straight knew me and with loudest voice proclaimed
1	me him for it was shewn him so from heaven 
1	me him whose harbinger he was and first
1	refused on me his baptism to confer 
1	as much his greater and was hardly won 
1	but as i rose out of the laving stream 
1	heaven opened her eternal doors from whence
1	the spirit descended on me like a dove 
1	and last the sum of all my father s voice 
1	audibly heard from heaven pronounced me his 
1	me his beloved son in whom alone
1	he was well pleased by which i knew the time
1	now full that i no more should live obscure 
1	but openly begin as best becomes
1	the authority which i derived from heaven 
1	and now by some strong motion i am led
1	into this wilderness to what intent
1	i learn not yet perhaps i need not know 
1	for what concerns my knowledge god reveals 
1	so spake our morning star then in his rise 
1	and looking round on every side beheld
1	a pathless desert dusk with horrid shades 
1	the way he came not having marked return 
1	was difficult by human steps untrod 
1	and he still on was led but with such thoughts
1	accompanied of things past and to come
1	lodged in his breast as well might recommend
1	such solitude before choicest society 
1	full forty days he passed whether on hill
1	sometimes anon in shady vale each night
1	under the covert of some ancient oak
1	or cedar to defend him from the dew 
1	or harboured in one cave is not revealed 
1	nor tasted human food nor hunger felt 
1	till those days ended hungered then at last
1	among wild beasts they at his sight grew mild 
1	nor sleeping him nor waking harmed his walk
1	the fiery serpent fled and noxious worm 
1	the lion and fierce tiger glared aloof 
1	but now an aged man in rural weeds 
1	following as seemed the quest of some stray eye 
1	or withered sticks to gather which might serve
1	against a winter s day when winds blow keen 
1	to warm him wet returned from field at eve 
1	he saw approach who first with curious eye
1	perused him then with words thus uttered spake 
1	 sir what ill chance hath brought thee to this place 
1	so far from path or road of men who pass
1	in troop or caravan for single none
1	durst ever who returned and dropt not here
1	his carcass pined with hunger and with droughth 
1	i ask the rather and the more admire 
1	for that to me thou seem st the man whom late
1	our new baptizing prophet at the ford
1	of jordan honoured so and called thee son
1	of god i saw and heard for we sometimes
1	who dwell this wild constrained by want come forth
1	to town or village nigh nighest is far 
1	where aught we hear and curious are to hear 
1	what happens new fame also finds us out 
1	to whom the son of god who brought me hither
1	will bring me hence no other guide i seek 
1	 by miracle he may replied the swain 
1	 what other way i see not for we here
1	live on tough roots and stubs to thirst inured
1	more than the camel and to drink go far 
1	men to much misery and hardship born 
1	but if thou be the son of god command
1	that out of these hard stones be made thee bread 
1	so shalt thou save thyself and us relieve
1	with food whereof we wretched seldom taste 
1	he ended and the son of god replied 
1	 think st thou such force in bread is it not written
1	 for i discern thee other than thou seem st 
1	man lives not by bread only but each word
1	proceeding from the mouth of god who fed
1	our fathers here with manna in the mount
1	moses was forty days nor eat nor drank 
1	and forty days eliah without food
1	wandered this barren waste the same i now 
1	why dost thou then suggest to me distrust
1	knowing who i am as i know who thou art 
1	whom thus answered the arch fiend now undisguised 
1	 tis true i am that spirit unfortunate
1	who leagued with millions more in rash revolt 
1	kept not my happy station but was driven
1	with them from bliss to the bottomless deep 
1	yet to that hideous place not so confined
1	by rigour unconniving but that oft 
1	leaving my dolorous prison i enjoy
1	large liberty to round this globe of earth 
1	or range in the air nor from the heaven of heavens
1	hath he excluded my resort sometimes 
1	i came among the sons of god when he
1	gave up into my hands uzzean job 
1	to prove him and illustrate his high worth 
1	and when to all his angels he proposed
1	to draw the proud king ahab into fraud 
1	that he might fall in ramoth they demurring 
1	i undertook that office and the tongues
1	of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies
1	to his destruction as i had in charge 
1	for what he bids i do though i have lost
1	much lustre of my native brightness lost
1	to be beloved of god i have not lost
1	to love at least contemplate and admire 
1	what i see excellent in good or fair 
1	or virtuous i should so have lost all sense 
1	what can be then less in me than desire
1	to see thee and approach thee whom i know
1	declared the son of god to hear attent
1	thy wisdom and behold thy godlike deeds 
1	men generally think me much a foe
1	to all mankind why should i they to me
1	never did wrong or violence by them
1	i lost not what i lost rather by them
1	i gained what i have gained and with them dwell
1	copartner in these regions of the world 
1	if not disposer lend them oft my aid 
1	oft my advice by presages and signs 
1	and answers oracles portents and dreams 
1	whereby they may direct their future life 
1	envy they say excites me thus to gain
1	companions of my misery and woe 
1	at first it may be but long since with woe
1	nearer acquainted now i feel by proof
1	that fellowship in pain divides not smart 
1	nor lightens aught each man s peculiar load 
1	small consolation then were man adjoined 
1	this wounds me most what can it less that man 
1	man fallen shall be restored i never more 
1	to whom our saviour sternly thus replied 
1	 deservedly thou griev st composed of lies
1	from the beginning and in lies wilt end 
1	who boast st release from hell and leave to come
1	into the heaven of heavens thou com st indeed 
1	as a poor miserable captive thrall
1	comes to the place where he before had sat
1	among the prime in splendour now deposed 
1	ejected emptied gazed unpitied shunned 
1	a spectacle of ruin or of scorn 
1	to all the host of heaven the happy place
1	imparts to thee no happiness no joy 
1	rather inflames thy torment representing
1	lost bliss to thee no more communicable 
1	so never more in hell than when in heaven 
1	but thou art serviceable to heaven s king 
1	wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear
1	extorts or pleasure to do ill excites 
1	what but thy malice moved thee to misdeem
1	of righteous job then cruelly to afflict him
1	with all inflictions but his patience won 
1	the other service was thy chosen task 
1	to be a liar in four hundred mouths 
1	for lying is thy sustenance thy food 
1	yet thou pretend st to truth all oracles
1	by thee are given and what confessed more true
1	among the nations that hath been thy craft 
1	by mixing somewhat true to vent more lies 
1	but what have been thy answers what but dark 
1	ambiguous and with double sense deluding 
1	which they who asked have seldom understood 
1	and not well understood as good not known 
1	who ever by consulting at thy shrine 
1	returned the wiser or the more instruct
1	to fly or follow what concerned him most 
1	and run not sooner to his fatal snare 
1	for god hath justly given the nations up
1	to thy delusions justly since they fell
1	idolatrous but when his purpose is
1	among them to declare his providence 
1	to thee not known whence hast thou then thy truth 
1	but from him or his angels president
1	in every province who themselves disdaining
1	to approach thy temples give thee in command
1	to thy adorers thou with trembling fear 
1	or like a fawning parasite obey st 
1	then to thyself ascrib st the truth foretold 
1	but this thy glory shall be soon retrenched 
1	no more shalt thou by oracling abuse
1	the gentiles henceforth oracles are ceased 
1	and thou no more with pomp and sacrifice
1	shalt be enquired at delphos or elsewhere 
1	at least in vain for they shall find thee mute 
1	god hath now sent his living oracle
1	into the world to teach his final will 
1	and sends his spirit of truth henceforth to dwell
1	in pious hearts an inward oracle
1	to all truth requisite for men to know 
1	so spake our saviour but the subtle fiend 
1	though inly stung with anger and disdain 
1	dissembled and this answer smooth returned 
1	 sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke 
1	and urged me hard with doings which not will 
1	but misery hath wrested from me where
1	easily canst thou find one miserable 
1	and not inforced oft times to part from truth 
1	if it may stand him more in stead to lie 
1	say and unsay feign flatter or abjure 
1	but thou art placed above me thou art lord 
1	from thee i can and must submiss endure
1	cheek or reproof and glad to scape so quit 
1	hard are the ways of truth and rough to walk 
1	smooth on the tongue discoursed pleasing to the ear 
1	and tunable as sylvan pipe or song 
1	what wonder then if i delight to hear
1	her dictates from thy mouth most men admire
1	virtue who follow not her lore permit me
1	to hear thee when i come since no man comes 
1	and talk at least though i despair to attain 
1	thy father who is holy wise and pure 
1	suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest
1	to tread his sacred courts and minister
1	about his altar handling holy things 
1	praying or vowing and voutsafed his voice
1	to balaam reprobate a prophet yet
1	inspired disdain not such access to me 
1	to whom our saviour with unaltered brow 
1	 thy coming hither though i know thy scope 
1	i bid not or forbid do as thou find st
1	permission from above thou canst not more 
1	he added not and satan bowling low
1	his gray dissimulation disappeared 
1	into thin air diffused for now began
1	night with her sullen wing to double shade
1	the desert fowls in their clay nests were couched 
1	and now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam 
1	meanwhile the new baptized who yet remained
1	at jordan with the baptist and had seen
1	him whom they heard so late expressly called
1	jesus messiah son of god declared 
1	and on that high authority had believed 
1	and with him talked and with him lodged i mean
1	andrew and simon famous after known 
1	with others though in holy writ not named 
1	now missing him their joy so lately found 
1	so lately found and so abruptly gone 
1	began to doubt and doubted many days 
1	and as the days increased increased their doubt 
1	sometimes they thought he might be only shewn 
1	and for a time caught up to god as once
1	moses was in the mount and missing long 
1	and the great thisbite who on fiery wheels
1	rode up to heaven yet once again to come 
1	therefore as those young prophets then with care
1	sought lost eliah so in each place these
1	nigh to bethabara in jericho
1	the city of palms aenon and salem old 
1	machaerus and each town or city walled
1	on this side the broad lake genezaret 
1	or in peraea but returned in vain 
1	then on the bank of jordan by a creek 
1	where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play 
1	plain fishermen no greater men them call 
1	close in a cottage low together got 
1	their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed 
1	 alas from what high hope to what relapse
1	unlooked for are we fallen our eyes beheld
1	messiah certainly now come so long
1	expected of our fathers we have heard
1	his words his wisdom full of grace and truth 
1	 now now for sure deliverance is at hand 
1	the kingdom shall to israel be restored 
1	thus we rejoiced but soon our joy is turned
1	into perplexity and new amaze 
1	for whither is he gone what accident
1	hath rapt him from us will he now retire
1	after appearance and again prolong
1	our expectation god of israel 
1	send thy messiah forth the time is come 
1	behold the kings of the earth how they oppress
1	thy chosen to what highth their power unjust
1	they have exalted and behind them cast
1	all fear of thee arise and vindicate
1	thy glory free thy people from their yoke 
1	but let us wait thus far he hath performed 
1	sent his anointed and to us revealed him
1	by his great prophet pointed at and shown
1	in public and with him we have conversed 
1	let us be glad of this and all our fears
1	lay on his providence he will not fail 
1	nor will withdraw him now nor will recall 
1	mock us with his blest sight then snatch him hence 
1	soon we shall see our hope our joy return 
1	thus they out of their plaints new hope resume
1	to find whom at the first they found unsought 
1	but to his mother mary when she saw
1	others returned from baptism not her son 
1	nor left at jordan tidings of him none 
1	within her breast though calm her breast though pure 
1	motherly cares and fears got head and raised
1	some troubled thoughts which she in sighs thus clad 
1	 oh what avails me now that honour high 
1	to have conceived of god or that salute 
1	 hail highly favoured among women blest 
1	while i to sorrows am no less advanced 
1	and fears as eminent above the lot
1	of other women by the birth i bore 
1	in such a season born when scarce a shed
1	could be obtained to shelter him or me
1	from the bleak air a stable was our warmth 
1	a manger his yet soon enforced to fly
1	were dead who sought his life and missing filled
1	with infant blood the streets of bethlehem 
1	hath been our dwelling many years his life
1	private unactive calm contemplative 
1	little suspicious to any king but now 
1	full grown to man acknowledged as i hear 
1	by john the baptist and in public shewn 
1	son owned from heaven by his father s voice 
1	i looked for some great change to honour no 
1	but trouble as old simeon plain foretold 
1	that to the fall and rising he should be
1	of many in israel and to a sign
1	spoken against that through my very soul
1	a sword shall pierce this is my favoured lot 
1	my exaltation to afflictions high 
1	afflicted i may be it seems and blest 
1	i will not argue that nor will repine 
1	but where delays he now some great intent
1	conceals him when twelve years he scarce had seen 
1	i lost him but so found as well i saw
1	he could not lose himself but went about
1	his father s business what he meant i mused 
1	since understand much more his absence now
1	thus long to some great purpose he obscures 
1	but i to wait with patience am inured 
1	my heart hath been a storehouse long of things
1	and sayings laid up pretending strange events 
1	thus mary pondering oft and oft to mind
1	recalling what remarkably had passed
1	since first her salutation heard with thoughts
1	meekly composed awaited the fulfilling 
1	the while her son tracing the desert wild 
1	sole but with holiest meditations fed 
1	into himself descended and at once
1	all his great work to come before him set 
1	how to begin how to accomplish best
1	his end of being on earth and mission high 
1	for satan with sly preface to return 
1	had left him vacant and with speed was gone
1	up to the middle region of thick air 
1	where all his potentates in council sate 
1	there without sign of boast or sign of joy 
1	solicitous and blank he thus began 
1	 princes heaven s ancient sons aethereal thrones 
1	daemonian spirits now from the element
1	each of his reign allotted rightlier called
1	powers of fire air water and earth beneath
1	 so may we hold our place and these mild seats
1	without new trouble such an enemy
1	is risen to invade us who no less
1	threatens than our expulsion down to hell 
1	i as i undertook and with the vote
1	consenting in full frequence was impowered 
1	have found him viewed him tasted him but find
1	far other labour to be undergone
1	than when i dealt with adam first of men 
1	though adam by his wife s allurement fell 
1	however to this man inferior far 
1	if he be man by mother s side at least
1	with more than human gifts from heaven adorned 
1	perfections absolute graces divine 
1	and amplitude of mind to greatest deeds 
1	therefore i am returned lest confidence
1	of my success with eve in paradise
1	deceive ye to persuasion over sure
1	of like succeeding here i summon all
1	rather to be in readiness with hand
1	or counsel to assist lest i who erst
1	thought none my equal now be overmatched 
1	so spake the old serpent doubting and from all
1	with clamour was assured their utmost aid
1	at his command when from amidst them rose
1	belial the dissolutest spirit that fell 
1	the sensualest and after asmodai 
1	the fleshliest incubus and thus advised 
1	 set women in his eye and in his walk 
1	among daughters of men the fairest found 
1	many are in each region passing fair
1	as the noon sky more like to goddesses
1	than mortal creatures graceful and discreet 
1	expert in amorous arts enchanting tongues
1	persuasive virgin majesty with mild
1	and sweet allayed yet terrible to approach 
1	skilled to retire and in retiring draw
1	hearts after them tangled in amorous nets 
1	such object hath the power to soften and tame
1	severest temper smooth the rugged st brow 
1	enerve and with voluptuous hope dissolve 
1	draw out with credulous desire and lead
1	at will the manliest resolutest breast 
1	as the magnetic hardest iron draws 
1	women when nothing else beguiled the heart
1	of wisest solomon and made him build 
1	and made him bow to the gods of his wives 
1	to whom quick answer satan thus returned 
1	 belial in much uneven scale thou weigh st
1	all others by thyself because of old
1	thou thyself doat st on womankind admiring
1	their shape their colour and attractive grace 
1	none are thou think st but taken with such toys 
1	before the flood thou with thy lusty crew 
1	false titled sons of god roaming the earth 
1	cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men 
1	and coupled with them and begot a race 
1	have we not seen or by relation heard 
1	in courts and regal chambers how thou lurk st 
1	in wood or grove by mossy fountain side 
1	in valley or green meadow to waylay
1	some beauty rare calisto clymene 
1	or amymone syrinx many more
1	too long then lay st thy scapes on names adored 
1	satyr or faun or silvan but these haunts
1	delight not all among the sons of men
1	how many have with a smile made small account
1	of beauty and her lures easily scorned
1	all her assaults on worthier things intent 
1	remember that pellean conqueror 
1	a youth how all the beauties of the east
1	he slightly viewed and slightly overpassed 
1	how he surnamed of africa dismissed 
1	in his prime youth the fair iberian maid 
1	for solomon he lived at ease and full
1	of honour wealth high fare aimed not beyond
1	higher design than to enjoy his state 
1	thence to the bait of women lay exposed 
1	but he whom we attempt is wiser far
1	than solomon of more exalted mind 
1	made and set wholly on the accomplishment
1	of greatest things what woman will you find 
1	though of this age the wonder and the fame 
1	on whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye
1	of fond desire or should she confident 
1	as sitting queen adored on beauty s throne 
1	descend with all her winning charms begirt
1	to enamour as the zone of venus once
1	wrought that effect on jove so fables tell 
1	how would one look from his majestic brow 
1	seated as on the top of virtue s hill 
1	discountenance her despised and put to rout
1	all her array her female pride deject 
1	or turn to reverent awe for beauty stands
1	in the admiration only of weak minds
1	led captive cease to admire and all her plumes
1	fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy 
1	at every sudden slighting quite abashed 
1	therefore with manlier objects we must try
1	his constancy with such as have more shew
1	of worth of honour glory and popular praise
1	 rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked 
1	or that which only seems to satisfy
1	lawful desires of nature not beyond 
1	and now i know he hungers where no food
1	is to be found in the wide wilderness 
1	the rest commit to me i shall let pass
1	no advantage and his strength as oft assay 
1	he ceased and heard their grant in loud acclaim 
1	then forthwith to him takes a chosen band
1	of spirits likest to himself in guile 
1	to be at hand and at his beck appear 
1	if cause were to unfold some active scene
1	of various persons each to know his part 
1	then to the desert takes with these his flight 
1	where still from shade to shade the son of god 
1	after forty days fasting had remained 
1	now hungering first and to himself thus said 
1	 where will this end four times ten days i have passed
1	wandering this woody maze and human food
1	nor tasted nor had appetite that fast
1	to virtue i impute not or count part
1	of what i suffer here if nature need not 
1	or god support nature without repast 
1	though needing what praise is it to endure 
1	but now i feel i hunger which declares
1	nature hath need of what she asks yet god
1	can satisfy that need some other way 
1	though hunger still remain so it remain
1	without this body s wasting i content me 
1	and from the sting of famine fear no harm 
1	nor mind it fed with better thoughts that feed
1	me hungering more to do my father s will 
1	it was the hour of night when thus the son
1	communed in silent walk then laid him down
1	under the hospitable covert nigh
1	of trees thick interwoven there he slept 
1	and dreamed as appetite is wont to dream 
1	of meats and drinks nature s refreshment sweet 
1	him thought he by the brook of cherith stood 
1	and saw the ravens with their horny beaks
1	food to elijah bringing even and morn 
1	though ravenous taught to abstain from what they brought 
1	he saw the prophet also how he fled
1	into the desert and how there he slept
1	under a juniper then how awaked 
1	he found his supper on the coals prepared 
1	and by the angel was bid rise and eat 
1	and eat the second time after repose 
1	the strength whereof sufficed him forty days 
1	sometimes that with elijah he partook 
1	or as a guest with daniel at his pulse 
1	thus wore out night and now the harald lark
1	left his ground nest high towering to descry
1	the morn s approach and greet her with his song 
1	as lightly from his grassy couch up rose
1	our saviour and found all was but a dream 
1	fasting he went to sleep and fasting waked 
1	up to a hill anon his steps he reared 
1	from whose high top to ken the prospect round 
1	if cottage were in view sheep cote or herd 
1	but cottage herd or sheep cote none he saw 
1	only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove 
1	with chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud 
1	thither he bent his way determined there
1	to rest at noon and entered soon the shade
1	high roofed and walks beneath and alleys brown 
1	that opened in the midst a woody scene 
1	nature s own work it seemed nature taught art 
1	and to a superstitious eye the haunt
1	of wood gods and wood nymphs he viewed it round 
1	when suddenly a man before him stood 
1	not rustic as before but seemlier clad 
1	as one in city or court or palace bred 
1	and with fair speech these words to him addressed 
1	 with granted leave officious i return 
1	but much more wonder that the son of god
1	in this wild solitude so long should bide 
1	of all things destitute and well i know 
1	not without hunger others of some note 
1	as story tells have trod this wilderness 
1	the fugitive bond woman with her son 
1	outcast nebaioth yet found here relief
1	by a providing angel all the race
1	of israel here had famished had not god
1	rained from heaven manna and that prophet bold 
1	native of thebez wandering here was fed
1	twice by a voice inviting him to eat 
1	of thee those forty days none hath regard 
1	forty and more deserted here indeed 
1	to whom thus jesus what conclud st thou hence 
1	they all had need i as thou seest have none 
1	 how hast thou hunger then satan replied 
1	 tell me if food were now before thee set 
1	wouldst thou not eat thereafter as i like
1	the giver answered jesus why should that
1	cause thy refusal said the subtle fiend 
1	 hast thou not right to all created things 
1	owe not all creatures by just right to thee
1	duty and service nor to stay till bid 
1	but tender all their power nor mention i
1	meats by the law unclean or offered first
1	to idols those young daniel could refuse 
1	nor proffered by an enemy though who
1	would scruple that with want oppressed behold 
1	nature ashamed or better to express 
1	troubled that thou shouldst hunger hath purveyed
1	from all the elements her choicest store 
1	to treat thee as beseems and as her lord
1	with honour only deign to sit and eat 
1	he spake no dream for as his words had end 
1	our saviour lifting up his eyes beheld 
1	in ample space under the broadest shade 
1	a table richly spread in regal mode 
1	with dishes piled and meats of noblest sort
1	and savour beasts of chase or fowl of game 
1	in pastry built or from the spit or boiled 
1	grisamber steamed all fish from sea or shore 
1	freshet or purling brook of shell or fin 
1	and exquisitest name for which was drained
1	pontus and lucrine bay and afric coast 
1	alas how simple to these cates compared 
1	was that crude apple that diverted eve 
1	and at a stately sideboard by the wine 
1	that fragrant smell diffused in order stood
1	tall stripling youths rich clad of fairer hue
1	than ganymed or hylas distant more 
1	under the trees now tripped now solemn stood 
1	nymphs of diana s train and naiades
1	with fruits and flowers from amalthea s horn 
1	and ladies of the hesperides that seemed
1	fairer than feigned of old or fabled since
1	of faery damsels met in forest wide
1	by knights of logres or of lyones 
1	and all the while harmonious airs were heard
1	of chiming strings or charming pipes and winds
1	of gentlest gale arabian odours fanned
1	from their soft wings and flora s earliest smells 
1	such was the splendour and the tempter now
1	his invitation earnestly renewed 
1	 what doubts the son of god to sit and eat 
1	these are not fruits forbidden no interdict
1	defends the touching of these viands pure 
1	their taste no knowledge works at least of evil 
1	but life preserves destroys life s enemy 
1	hunger with sweet restorative delight 
1	all these are spirits of air and woods and springs 
1	thy gentle ministers who come to pay
1	thee homage and acknowledge thee their lord 
1	what doubt st thou son of god sit down and eat 
1	to whom thus jesus temperately replied 
1	 said st thou not that to all things i had right 
1	and who withholds my power that right to use 
1	shall i receive by gift what of my own 
1	when and where likes me best i can command 
1	i can at will doubt not as soon as thou 
1	command a table in this wilderness 
1	and call swift flights of angels ministrant 
1	arrayed in glory on my cup to attend 
1	why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence
1	in vain where no acceptance it can find 
1	and with my hunger what hast thou to do 
1	thy pompous delicacies i contemn 
1	and count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles 
1	to whom thus answered satan male content 
1	 that i have also power to give thou seest 
1	if of that power i bring thee voluntary
1	what i might have bestowed on whom i pleased 
1	and rather opportunely in this place
1	chose to impart to thy apparent need 
1	why shouldst thou not accept it but i see
1	what i can do or offer is suspect 
1	of these things others quickly will dispose 
1	whose pains have earned the far fet spoil with that
1	both table and provision vanished quite 
1	with sound of harpies wings and talons heard 
1	only the importune tempter still remained 
1	and with these words his temptation pursued 
1	 by hunger that each other creature tames 
1	thou art not to be harmed therefore not moved 
1	thy temperance invincible besides 
1	for no allurement yields to appetite 
1	and all thy heart is set on high designs 
1	high actions but wherewith to be achieved 
1	great acts require great means of enterprise 
1	thou art unknown unfriended low of birth 
1	a carpenter thy father known thyself
1	bred up in poverty and straits at home 
1	lost in a desert here and hunger bit 
1	which way or from what hope dost thou aspire
1	to greatness whence authority deriv st 
1	what followers what retinue canst thou gain 
1	or at thy heels the dizzy multitude 
1	longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost 
1	money brings honour friends conquest and realms 
1	what raised antipater the edomite 
1	and his son herod placed on juda s throne 
1	thy throne but gold that got him puissant friends 
1	therefore if at great things thou wouldst arrive 
1	get riches first get wealth and treasure heap 
1	not difficult if thou hearken to me 
1	riches are mine fortune is in my hand 
1	they whom i favour thrive in wealth amain 
1	while virtue valour wisdom sit in want 
1	to whom thus jesus patiently replied 
1	 yet wealth without these three is impotent
1	to gain dominion or to keep it gained 
1	witness those ancient empires of the earth 
1	in highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved 
1	but men endued with these have oft attained 
1	in lowest poverty to highest deeds 
1	gideon and jephtha and the shepherd lad
1	whose offspring on the throne of juda sate
1	so many ages and shall yet regain
1	that seat and reign in israel without end 
1	among the heathen for throughout the world
1	to me is not unknown what hath been done
1	worthy of memorial canst thou not remember
1	for i esteem those names of men so poor 
1	who could do mighty things and could contemn
1	riches though offered from the hand of kings 
1	and what in me seems wanting but that i
1	may also in this poverty as soon
1	accomplish what they did perhaps and more 
1	extol not riches then the toil of fools 
1	the wise man s cumbrance if not snare more apt
1	to slacken virtue and abate her edge
1	than prompt her to do aught may merit praise 
1	what if with like aversion i reject
1	riches and realms yet not for that a crown 
1	golden in shew is but a wreath of thorns 
1	brings dangers troubles cares and sleepless nights 
1	to him who wears the regal diadem 
1	when on his shoulders each man s burden lies 
1	for therein stands the office of a king 
1	his honour virtue merit and chief praise 
1	that for the public all this weight he bears 
1	yet he who reigns within himself and rules
1	passions desires and fears is more a king 
1	which every wise and virtuous man attains 
1	and who attains not ill aspires to rule
1	cities of men or headstrong multitudes 
1	subject himself to anarchy within 
1	or lawless passions in him which he serves 
1	but to guide nations in the way of truth
1	by saving doctrine and from error lead
1	to know and knowing worship god aright 
1	is yet more kingly this attracts the soul 
1	governs the inner man the nobler part 
1	that other o er the body only reigns 
1	and oft by force which to a generous mind
1	so reigning can be no sincere delight 
1	besides to give a kingdom hath been thought
1	greater and nobler done and to lay down
1	far more magnanimous than to assume 
1	riches are needless then both for themselves 
1	and for thy reason why they should be sought 
1	to gain a sceptre oftest better missed 
1	so spake the son of god and satan stood
1	a while as mute confounded what to say 
1	what to reply confuted and convinced
1	of his weak arguing and fallacious drift 
1	at length collecting all his serpent wiles 
1	with soothing words renewed him thus accosts 
1	 i see thou know st what is of use to know 
1	what best to say canst say to do canst do 
1	thy actions to thy words accord thy words
1	to thy large heart give utterance due thy heart
1	contains of good wise just the perfet shape 
1	should kings and nations from thy mouth consult 
1	thy counsel would be as the oracle
1	urim and thummim those oraculous gems
1	on aaron s breast or tongue of seers old
1	infallible or wert thou sought to deeds
1	that might require the array of war thy skill
1	of conduct would be such that all the world
1	could not sustain thy prowess or subsist
1	in battle though against thy few in arms 
1	these godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide 
1	affecting private life or more obscure
1	in savage wilderness wherefore deprive
1	all earth her wonder at thy acts thyself
1	the fame and glory glory the reward
1	that sole excites to high attempts the flame
1	of most erected spirits most tempered pure
1	aethereal who all pleasures else despise 
1	all treasures and all gain esteem as dross 
1	and dignities and powers all but the highest 
1	thy years are ripe and over ripe the son
1	of macedonian philip had ere these
1	won asia and the throne of cyrus held
1	at his dispose young scipio had brought down
1	the carthaginian pride young pompey quelled
1	the pontic king and in triumph had rode 
1	yet years and to ripe years judgment mature 
1	quench not the thirst of glory but augment 
1	great julius whom now all the world admires 
1	the more he grew in years the more inflamed
1	with glory wept that he had lived so long
1	ingloroious but thou yet art not too late 
1	to whom our saviour calmly thus replied 
1	 thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth
1	for empire s sake nor empire to affect
1	for glory s sake by all thy argument 
1	for what is glory but the blaze of fame 
1	the people s praise if always praise unmixed 
1	and what the people but a herd confused 
1	a miscellaneous rabble who extol
1	things vulgar and well weighed scarce worth the praise 
1	they praise and they admire they know not what 
1	and know not whom but as one leads the other 
1	and what delight to be by such extolled 
1	to live upon their tongues and be their talk 
1	of whom to be dispraised were no small praise 
1	his lot who dares be singularly good 
1	the intelligent among them and the wise
1	are few and glory scarce of few is raised 
1	this is true glory and renown when god 
1	looking on the earth with approbation marks
1	the just man and divulges him through heaven
1	to all his angels who with true applause
1	recount his praises thus he did to job 
1	when to extend his fame through heaven and earth 
1	as thou to thy reproach may st well remember 
1	he asked thee hast thou seen my servant job 
1	famous he was in heaven on earth less known 
1	where glory is false glory attributed
1	to things not glorious men not worthy of fame 
1	they err who count it glorious to subdue
1	by conquest far and wide to overrun
1	large countries and in field great battles win 
1	great cities by assault what do these worthies
1	but rob and spoil burn slaughter and enslave
1	peaceable nations neighbouring or remote 
1	made captive yet deserving freedom more
1	than those their conquerors who leave behind
1	nothing but ruin wheresoe er they rove 
1	and all the flourishing works of peace destroy 
1	then swell with pride and must be titled gods 
1	great benefactors of mankind deliverers 
1	worshipped with temple priest and sacrifice 
1	one is the son of jove of mars the other 
1	till conqueror death discover them scarce men 
1	rowling in brutish vices and deformed 
1	violent or shameful death their due reward 
1	but if there be in glory aught of good 
1	it may be means far different be attained 
1	without ambition war or violence 
1	by deeds of peace by wisdom eminent 
1	by patience temperance i mention still
1	him whom thy wrongs with saintly patience borne 
1	made famous in a land and times obscure 
1	who names not now with honour patient job 
1	poor socrates who next more memorable 
1	by what he taught and suffered for so doing 
1	for truth s sake suffering death unjust lives now
1	equal in fame to proudest conquerors 
1	yet if for fame and glory aught be done 
1	aught suffered if young african for fame
1	his wasted country freed from punic rage 
1	the deed becomes unpraised the man at least 
1	and loses though but verbal his reward 
1	shall i seek glory then as vain men seek 
1	oft not deserved i seek not mine but his
1	who sent me and thereby witness whence i am 
1	to whom the tempter murmuring thus replied 
1	 think not so slight of glory therein least
1	resembling thy great father he seeks glory 
1	and for his glory all things made all things
1	orders and governs nor content in heaven 
1	by all his angels glorified requires
1	glory from men from all men good or bad 
1	wise or unwise no difference no exemption 
1	above all sacrifice or hallowed gift 
1	glory he requires and glory he receives 
1	or barbarous nor exception hath declared 
1	from us his foes pronounced glory he exacts 
1	to whom our saviour fervently replied 
1	 and reason since his word all things produced 
1	though chiefly not for glory as prime end 
1	but to shew forth his goodness and impart
1	his good communicable to every soul
1	freely of whom what could he less expect
1	than glory and benediction that is thanks 
1	the slightest easiest readiest recompense
1	from them who could return him nothing else 
1	and not returning that would likeliest render
1	contempt instead dishonour obloquy 
1	hard recompense unsuitable return
1	for so much good so much beneficience 
1	but why should man seek glory who of his own
1	hath nothing and to whom nothing belongs
1	but condemnation ignominy and shame 
1	who for so many benefits received 
1	turned recreant to god ingrate and false 
1	and so of all true good himself despoiled 
1	yet sacrilegious to himself would take
1	that which to god alone of right belongs 
1	yet so much bounty is in god such grace 
1	that who advances his glory not their own 
1	them he himself to glory will advance 
1	so spake the son of god and here again
1	satan had not to answer but stood struck
1	with guilt of his own sin for he himself 
1	insatiable of glory had lost all 
1	yet of another plea bethought him soon 
1	 of glory as thou wilt said he so deem 
1	worth or not worth the seeking let it pass 
1	but to a kingdom thou art born ordained
1	to sit upon thy father david s throne 
1	by mother s side thy father though thy right
1	be now in powerful hands that will not part
1	easily from possession won with arms 
1	reduced a province under roman yoke 
1	obeys tiberius nor is always ruled
1	with temperate sway oft have they violated
1	the temple oft the law with foul affronts 
1	abominations rather as did once
1	antiochus and think st thou to regain
1	thy right by sitting still or thus retiring 
1	so did not machabeus he indeed
1	retired unto the desert but with arms 
1	and o er a mighty king so oft prevailed
1	that by strong hand his family obtained 
1	though priests the crown and david s throne usurped 
1	with modin and her suburbs once content 
1	if kingdom move thee not let move thee zeal
1	and duty zeal and duty are not slow 
1	but on occasion s forelock watchful wait 
1	they themselves rather are occasion best 
1	zeal of thy father s house duty to free
1	thy country from her heathen servitude 
1	so shalt thou best fulfil best verify 
1	the prophets old who sung thy endless reign 
1	the happier reign the sooner it begins 
1	rein then what canst thou better do the while 
1	to whom our saviour answer thus returned 
1	 all things are best fulfilled in their due time 
1	and time there is for all things truth hath said 
1	if of my reign prophetic writ hath told
1	that it shall never end so when begin
1	the father in his purpose hath decreed 
1	he in whose hand all times and seasons rowl 
1	what if he hath decreed that i shall first
1	be tried in humble state and things adverse 
1	by tribulations injuries insults 
1	contempts and scorns and snares and violence 
1	suffering abstaining quietly expecting
1	without distrust or doubt that he may know
1	what i can suffer how obey who best
1	can suffer best can do best reign who first
1	well hath obeyed just trial ere i merit
1	my exaltation without change or end 
1	but what concerns it thee when i begin
1	my everlasting kingdom why art thou
1	solicitous what moves thy inquisition 
1	know st thou not that my rising is thy fall 
1	and my promotion will be thy destruction 
1	to whom the tempter inly racked replied 
1	 let that come when it comes all hope is lost
1	of my reception into grace what worse 
1	for where no hope is left is left no fear 
1	if there be worse the expectation more
1	of worse torments me than the feeling can 
1	i would be at the worst worst is my port 
1	my harbour and my ultimate repose 
1	the end i would attain my final good 
1	my error was my error and my crime
1	my crime whatever for itself condemned 
1	and will alike be punished whether thou
1	reign or reign not though to that gentle brow
1	willingly i could fly and hope thy reign 
1	from that placid aspect and meek regard 
1	rather than aggravate my evil state 
1	would stand between me and thy father s ire
1	 whose ire i dread more than the fire of hell 
1	a shelter and a kind of shading cool
1	interposition as a summer s cloud 
1	if i then to the worst that can be haste 
1	why move thy feet so slow to what is best 
1	happiest both to thyself and all the world 
1	that thou who worthiest art shouldst be their king 
1	perhaps thou linger st in deep thoughts detained
1	of the enterprise so hazardous and high 
1	no wonder for though in thee be united
1	what of perfection can in man be found 
1	or human nature can receive consider
1	thy life hath yet been private most part spent
1	at home scarce viewed the galilean towns 
1	and once a year jerusalem few days 
1	short sojourn and what thence couldst thou observe 
1	the world thou hast not seen much less her glory 
1	empires and monarchs and their radiant courts 
1	best school of best experience quickest in sight
1	in all things that to greatest actions lead 
1	the wisest unexperienced will be ever
1	timorous and loth with novice modesty
1	 as he who seeking asses found a kingdom 
1	irresolute unhardy unadventrous 
1	but i will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit
1	those rudiments and see before thine eyes
1	the monarchies of the earth their pomp and state 
1	sufficient introduction to inform
1	thee of thyself so apt in regal arts 
1	and regal mysteries that thou may st know
1	how best their opposition to withstand 
1	with that such power was given him then he took
1	the son of god up to a mountain high 
1	it was a mountain at whose verdant feet
1	a spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide
1	lay pleasant from his side two rivers flowed 
1	the one winding the other straight and left between
1	fair champaign with less rivers interveined 
1	then meeting joined their tribute to the sea 
1	fertil of corn the glebe of oil and wine 
1	with herds the pasture thronged with flocks the hills 
1	huge cities and high towered that well might seem
1	the seats of mightiest monarchs and so large
1	the prospect was that here and there was room
1	for barren desert fountainless and dry 
1	to this high mountain top the tempter brought
1	our saviour and new train of words began 
1	 well have we speeded and o er hill and dale 
1	forest and field and flood temples and towers 
1	cut shorter many a league here thou behold st
1	assyria and her empire s ancient bounds 
1	araxes and the caspian lake thence on
1	as far as indus east euphrates west 
1	and oft beyond to south the persian bay 
1	and inaccessible the arabian drouth 
1	here nineveh of length within her wall
1	several days journey built by ninus old 
1	of that first golden monarchy the seat 
1	and seat of salmanassar whose success
1	israel in long captivity still mourns 
1	there babylon the wonder of all tongues 
1	as ancient but rebuilt by him who twice
1	judah and all thy father david s house
1	led captive and jerusalem laid waste 
1	till cyrus set them free persepolis 
1	his city there thou seest and bactra there 
1	ecbatana her structure vast there shews 
1	and hecatompylos her hunderd gates 
1	there susa by choaspes amber stream 
1	the drink of none but kings of later fame 
1	built by emathian or by parthian hands 
1	the great seleucia nisibis and there
1	turning with easy eye thou may st behold 
1	all these the parthian now some ages past
1	by great arsaces led who founded first
1	that empire under his dominion holds 
1	from the luxurious kings of antioch won 
1	and just in time thou com st to have a view
1	of his great power for now the parthian king
1	in ctesiphon hath gathered all his host
1	against the scythian whose incursions wild
1	have wasted sogdiana to her aid
1	he marches now in haste see though from far 
1	his thousands in what martial equipage
1	they issue forth steel bows and shafts their arms 
1	of equal dread in flight or in pursuit 
1	all horsemen in which fight they most excel 
1	see how in warlike muster they appear 
1	in rhombs and wedges and half moons and wings 
1	he looked and saw what numbers numberless
1	the city gates outpoured light armed troops
1	in coats of mail and military pride 
1	in mail their horses clad yet fleet and strong 
1	prauncing their riders bore the flower and choice
1	of many provinces from bound to bound 
1	from arachosia from candaor east 
1	and margiana to the hyrcanian cliffs
1	of caucasus and dark iberian dales 
1	from atropatia and the neighbouring plains
1	of adiabene media and the south
1	of susiana to balsara s haven 
1	he saw them in their forms of battle ranged 
1	how quick they wheeled and flying behind them shot
1	sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face
1	of their pursuers and overcame by flight 
1	the field all iron cast a gleaming brown 
1	nor wanted clouds of foot nor on each horn 
1	cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight 
1	chariots or elephants indorsed with towers
1	of archers nor of labouring pioners
1	to lay hills plain fell woods or valleys fill 
1	or where plain was raise hill or overlay
1	with bridges rivers proud as with a yoke 
1	mules after these camels and dromedaries 
1	and waggons fraught with utensils of war 
1	such forces met not nor so wide a camp 
1	when agrican with all his northern powers 
1	besieged albracea as romances tell 
1	the city of gallaphrone from thence to win
1	the fairest of her sex angelica 
1	his daughter sought by many prowest knights 
1	both paynim and the peers of charlemane 
1	such and so numerous was their chivalry 
1	at sight whereof the fiend yet more presumed 
1	and to our saviour thus his words renewed 
1	 that thou may st know i seek not to engage
1	thy virtue and not every way secure
1	on no slight grounds thy safety hear and mark
1	to what end i have brought thee hither and shew
1	all this fair sight thy kingdom though foretold
1	by prophet or by angel unless thou
1	endeavour as thy father david did 
1	thou never shalt obtain prediction still
1	in all things and all men supposes means 
1	without means used what it predicts revokes 
1	but say thou wert possessed of david s throne
1	by free consent of all none opposite 
1	long to enjoy it quiet and secure
1	between two such enclosing enemies 
1	roman and parthian therefore one of these
1	thou must make sure thy own the parthian first 
1	by my advice as nearer and of late
1	found able by invasion to annoy
1	thy country and captive lead away her kings 
1	antigonus and old hyrcanus bound 
1	maugre the roman it shall be my task
1	to render thee the parthian at dispose 
1	choose which thou wilt by conquest or by league 
1	by him thou shalt regain without him not 
1	that which alone can truly reinstall thee
1	in david s royal seat his true successor 
1	deliverance of thy brethren those ten tribes
1	whose offspring in his territory yet serve
1	in habor and among the medes dispersed 
1	the sons of jacob two of joseph lost
1	thus long from israel serving as of old
1	this offer sets before thee to deliver 
1	these if from servitude thou shalt restore
1	to their inheritance then nor till then 
1	thou on the throne of david in full glory 
1	shalt reign and rome or caesar not need fear 
1	to whom our saviour answered thus unmoved 
1	 much ostentation vain of fleshly arm
1	and fragile arms much instrument of war 
1	long in preparing soon to nothing brought 
1	before mine eyes thou hast set and in my ear
1	vented much policy and projects deep
1	of enemies of aids battles and leagues 
1	plausible to the world to me worth naught 
1	means i must use thou say st prediction else
1	will unpredict and fail me of the throne 
1	my time i told thee and that time for thee
1	were better farthest off is not yet come 
1	when that comes think not thou to find me slack
1	on my part aught endeavouring or to need
1	thy politic maxims or that cumbersome
1	luggage of war there shewn me argument
1	of human weakness rather than of strength 
1	my brethren as thou call st them those ten tribes 
1	i must deliver if i mean to reign
1	david s true heir and his full sceptre sway
1	to just extent over all israel s sons 
1	but whence to thee this zeal where was it then
1	for israel or for david or his throne 
1	when thou stood st up his tempter to the pride
1	of numbering israel which cost the lives
1	of threescore and ten thousand israelites
1	by three days pestilence such was thy zeal
1	to israel then the same that now to me 
1	as for those captive tribes themselves were they
1	who wrought their own captivity fell off
1	from god to worship calves the deities
1	and all the idolatries of heathen round 
1	besides their other worse than heathenish crimes 
1	nor in the land of their captivity
1	humbled themselves or penitent besought
1	the god of their forefathers but so died
1	impenitent and left a race behind
1	like to themselves distinguishable scarce
1	from gentiles but by circumcision vain 
1	and god with idols in their worship joined 
1	should i of these the liberty regard 
1	who freed as to their ancient patrimony 
1	unhumbled unrepentant unreformed 
1	headlong would follow and to their gods perhaps
1	of bethel and of dan no let them serve
1	their enemies who serve idols with god 
1	yet he at length time to himself best known 
1	remembering abraham by some wondrous call
1	may bring them back repentant and sincere 
1	and at their passing cleave the assyrian flood 
1	while to their native land with joy they haste 
1	as the red sea and jordan once he cleft 
1	when to the promised land their fathers passed 
1	to his due time and providence i leave them 
1	so spake israel s true king and to the fiend
1	made answer meet that made void all his wiles 
1	so fares it when with truth falsehood contends 
1	perplexed and troubled at his bad success
1	the tempter stood nor had what to reply 
1	discovered in his fraud thrown from his hope
1	so oft and the persuasive rhetoric
1	that sleeked his tongue and won so much on eve 
1	so little here nay lost but eve was eve 
1	this far his over match who self deceived
1	and rash beforehand had no better weighed
1	the strength he was to cope with or his own 
1	but as a man who had been matchless held
1	in cunning over reached where least he thought 
1	to salve his credit and for very spite 
1	still will be tempting him who foils him still 
1	and never cease though to his shame the more 
1	or as a swarm of flies in vintage time 
1	about the wine press where sweet must is poured 
1	beat off returns as oft with humming sound 
1	or surging waves against a solid rock 
1	though all to shivers dashed the assault renew 
1	 vain battery and in froth or bubbles end 
1	so satan whom repulse upon repulse
1	met ever and to shameful silence brought 
1	yet gives not o er though desperate of success 
1	and his vain importunity pursues 
1	he brought our saviour to the western side
1	of that high mountain whence he might behold
1	another plain long but in breadth not wide 
1	washed by the southern sea and on the north
1	to equal length backed with a ridge of hills
1	that screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men
1	from cold septentrion blasts thence in the midst
1	divided by a river off whose banks
1	on each side an imperial city stood 
1	with towers and temples proudly elevate
1	on seven small hills with palaces adorned 
1	porches and theatres baths aqueducts 
1	statues and trophies and triumphal arcs 
1	gardens and groves presented to his eyes
1	above the highth of mountains interposed 
1	by what strange parallax or optic skill
1	of vision multiplied through air or glass
1	of telescope were curious to enquire 
1	and now the tempter thus his silence broke 
1	 the city which thou seest no other deem
1	than great and glorious rome queen of the earth
1	so far renowned and with the spoils enriched
1	of nations there the capitol thou seest 
1	above the rest lifting his stately head
1	on the tarpeian rock her citadel
1	impregnable and there mount palatine 
1	the imperial palace compass huge and high
1	the structure skill of noblest architects 
1	with gilded battlements conspicuous far 
1	turrets and terraces and glittering spires 
1	many a fair edifice besides more like
1	houses of gods so well i have disposed
1	my aerie microscope thou may st behold 
1	outside and inside both pillars and roofs
1	carved work the hand of famed artificers
1	in cedar marble ivory or gold 
1	thence to the gates cast round thine eye and see
1	what conflux issuing forth or entering in 
1	praetors proconsuls to their provinces
1	hasting or on return in robes of state 
1	lictors and rods the ensigns of their power 
1	legions and cohorts turms of horse and wings 
1	or embassies from regions far remote 
1	in various habits on the appian road 
1	or on the aemilian some from farthest south 
1	syene and where the shadow both way falls 
1	meroe nilotic isle and more to west 
1	the realm of bocchus to the blackmoor sea 
1	from the asian kings and parthian among these 
1	and utmost indian isle taprobane 
1	dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed 
1	from gallia gades and the british west 
1	germans and scythians and sarmatians north
1	beyond danubius to the tauric pool 
1	all nations now to rome obedience pay 
1	to rome s great emperor whose wide domain 
1	in ample territory wealth and power 
1	civility of manners arts and arms 
1	and long renown thou justly may st prefer
1	before the parthian these two thrones except 
1	the rest are barbarous and scarce worth the sight 
1	shared among petty kings too far removed 
1	these having shewn thee i have shewn thee all
1	the kingdoms of the world and all their glory 
1	this emperor hath no son and now is old 
1	old and lascivious and from rome retired
1	to capreae an island small but strong
1	on the campanian shore with purpose there
1	his horrid lusts in private to enjoy 
1	committing to a wicked favourite
1	all public cares and yet of him suspicious 
1	hated of all and hating with what ease 
1	endued with regal virtues as thou art 
1	appearing and beginning noble deeds 
1	might st thou expel this monster from his throne 
1	now made a sty and in his place ascending 
1	a victor people free from servile yoke 
1	and with my help thou may st to me the power
1	is given and by that right i give it thee 
1	aim therefore at no less than all the world 
1	aim at the highest without the highest attained 
1	will be for thee no sitting or not long 
1	on david s throne be prophesied what will 
1	to whom the son of god unmoved replied 
1	 nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew
1	of luxury though called magnificence 
1	more than of arms before allure mine eye 
1	much less my mind though thou should st add to tell
1	their sumptuous gluttonies and gorgeous feasts
1	on citron tables or atlantic stone
1	 for i have also heard perhaps have read 
1	their wines of setia cales and falerne 
1	chios and crete and how they quaff in gold 
1	crystal and myrrhine cups imbossed with gems
1	and studs of pearl to me should st tell who thirst
1	and hunger still then embassies thou shew st
1	from nations far and nigh what honour that 
1	but tedious waste of time to sit and hear
1	so many hollow compliments and lies 
1	outlandish flatteries then proceed st to talk
1	of the emperor how easily subdued 
1	how gloriously i shall thou say st expel
1	a brutish monster what if i withal
1	expel a devil who first made him such 
1	let his tormentor conscience find him out 
1	for him i was not sent nor yet to free
1	that people victor once now vile and base 
1	deservedly made vassal who once just 
1	frugal and mild and temperate conquered well 
1	but govern ill the nations under yoke 
1	peeling their provinces exhausted all
1	by lust and rapine first ambitious grown
1	of triumph that insulting vanity 
1	then cruel by their sports to blood inured
1	of fighting beasts and men to beasts exposed 
1	luxurious by their wealth and greedier still 
1	and from the daily scene effeminate 
1	what wise and valiant man would seek to free
1	these thus degenerate by themselves enslaved 
1	or could of inward slaves make outward free 
1	know therefore when my season comes to sit
1	on david s throne it shall be like a tree
1	spreading and overshadowing all the earth 
1	or as a stone that shall to pieces dash
1	all monarchies besides throughout the world 
1	and of my kingdom there shall be no end 
1	means there shall be to this but what the means
1	is not for thee to know nor me to tell 
1	to whom the tempter impudent replied 
1	 i see all offers made by me how slight
1	thou valuest because offered and reject st 
1	nothing will please the difficult and nice 
1	or nothing more than still to contradict 
1	on the other side know also thou that i
1	on what i offer set as high esteem 
1	nor what i part with mean to give for naught 
1	all these which in a moment thou behold st 
1	the kingdoms of the world to thee i give
1	 for given to me i give to whom i please 
1	no trifle yet with this reserve not else 
1	on this condition if thou wilt fall down 
1	and worship me as thy superior lord
1	 easily done and hold them all of me 
1	for what can less so great a gift deserve 
1	whom thus our saviour answered with disdain 
1	 i never liked thy talk thy offers less 
1	now both abhor since thou hast dared to utter
1	the abominable terms impious condition 
1	but i endure the time till which expired
1	thou hast permission on me it is written 
1	the first of all commandments thou shalt worship
1	the lord thy god and only him shalt serve 
1	and dar st thou to the son of god propound
1	to worship thee accursed now more accursed
1	for this attempt bolder than that on eve 
1	and more blasphemous which expect to rue 
1	the kingdoms of the world to thee were given 
1	permitted rather and by thee usurped 
1	other donation none thou canst produce 
1	if given by whom but by the king of kings 
1	god over all supreme if given to thee 
1	by thee how fairly is the giver now
1	repaid but gratitude in thee is lost
1	long since wert thou so void of fear or shame
1	as offer them to me the son of god 
1	to me my own on such abhorred pact 
1	that i fall down and worship thee as god 
1	get thee behind me plain thou now appear st
1	that evil one satan for ever damned 
1	to whom the fiend with fear abashed replied 
1	 be not so sore offended son of god 
1	though sons of god both angels are and men 
1	if i to try whether in higher sort
1	than these thou bear st that title have proposed
1	what both from men and angels i receive 
1	nations besides from all the quartered winds 
1	god of this world invoked and world beneath 
1	who then thou art whose coming is foretold
1	to me most fatal me it most concerns 
1	the trial hath indamaged thee no way 
1	rather more honour left and more esteem 
1	me naught advantaged missing what i aimed 
1	therefore let pass as they are transitory 
1	the kingdoms of this world i shall no more
1	advise thee gain them as thou canst or not 
1	and thou thyself seem st otherwise inclined
1	than to a worldly crown addicted more
1	to contemplation and profound dispute 
1	as by that early action may be judged 
1	when slipping from thy mother s eye thou went st
1	alone into the temple there wast found
1	among the gravest rabbies disputant
1	on points and questions fitting moses chair 
1	teaching not taught the childhood shews the man 
1	as morning shews the day be famous then 
1	by wisdom as thy empire must extend 
1	so let extend thy mind o er all the world
1	in knowledge all things in it comprehend 
1	all knowledge is not couched in moses law 
1	the pentateuch or what the prophets wrote 
1	the gentiles also know and write and teach
1	to admiration led by nature s light 
1	and with the gentiles much thou must converse 
1	ruling them by persuasion as thou mean st 
1	without their learning how wilt thou with them 
1	or they with thee hold conversation meet 
1	how wilt thou reason with them how refute
1	their idolisms traditions paradoxes 
1	error by his own arms is best evinced 
1	look once more ere we leave this specular mount 
1	westward much nearer by south west behold
1	where on the aegean shore a city stands 
1	built nobly pure the air and light the soil 
1	athens the eye of greece mother of arts
1	and eloquence native to famous wits
1	or hospitable in her sweet recess 
1	city or suburban studious walks and shades 
1	see there the olive grove of academe 
1	plato s retirement where the attic bird
1	trills her thick warbled notes the summer long 
1	there flowery hill hymettus with the sound
1	of bees industrious murmur oft invites
1	to studious musing there ilissus rowls
1	his whispering stream within the walls then view
1	the schools of ancient sages his who bred
1	great alexander to subdue the world 
1	there thou shalt hear and learn the secret power
1	of harmony in tones and numbers hit
1	by voice or hand and various measured verse 
1	aeolian charms and dorian lyric odes 
1	and his who gave them breath but higher sung 
1	blind melesigenes thence homer called 
1	whose poem phoebus challenged for his own 
1	thence what the lofty grave tragedians taught
1	in chorus or iambic teachers best
1	of moral prudence with delight received
1	in brief sententious precepts while they treat
1	of fate and chance and change in human life 
1	high actions and high passions best describing 
1	thence to the famous orators repair 
1	those ancient whose resistless eloquence
1	wielded at will that fierce democraty 
1	shook the arsenal and fulmined over greece
1	to macedon and artaxerxes throne 
1	to sage philosophy next lend thine ear 
1	from heaven descended to the low roofed house
1	of socrates see there his tenement 
1	whom well inspired the oracle pronounced
1	wisest of men from whose mouth issued forth
1	mellifluous streams that watered all the schools
1	of academics old and new with those
1	surnamed peripatetics and the sect
1	epicurean and the stoic severe 
1	these here revolve or as thou likest at home 
1	till time mature thee to a kingdom s weight 
1	these rules will render thee a king complete
1	within thyself much more with empire joined 
1	to whom our saviour sagely thus replied 
1	 think not but that i know these things or think
1	i know them not not therefore am i short
1	of knowing what i ought he who receives
1	light from above from the fountain of light 
1	no other doctrine needs though granted true 
1	but these are false or little else but dreams 
1	conjectures fancies built on nothing firm 
1	the first and wisest of them all professed
1	to know this only that he nothing knew 
1	the next to fabling fell and smooth conceits 
1	a third sort doubted all things though plain sense 
1	others in virtue placed felicity 
1	but virtue joined with riches and long life 
1	in corporal pleasure he and careless ease 
1	the stoic last in philosophic pride 
1	by him called virtue and his virtuous man 
1	wise perfect in himself and all possessing 
1	equal to god oft shames not to prefer 
1	as fearing god nor man contemning all
1	wealth pleasure pain or torment death and life 
1	which when he lists he leaves or boasts he can 
1	for all his tedious talk is but vain boast 
1	or subtle shifts conviction to evade 
1	alas what can they teach and not mislead 
1	ignorant of themselves of god much more 
1	and how the world began and how man fell 
1	degraded by himself on grace depending 
1	much of the soul they talk but all awry 
1	and in themselves seek virtue and to themselves
1	all glory arrogate to god give none 
1	rather accuse him under usual names 
1	fortune and fate as one regardless quite
1	of mortal things who therefore seeks in these
1	true wisdom finds her not or by delusion
1	far worse her false resemblance only meets 
1	an empty cloud however many books 
1	wise men have said are wearisome who reads
1	incessantly and to his reading brings not
1	a spirit and judgment equal or superior 
1	 and what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek 
1	uncertain and unsettled still remains 
1	deep versed in books and shallow in himself 
1	crude or intoxicate collecting toys
1	and trifles for choice matters worth a sponge 
1	as children gathering pebbles on the shore 
1	or if i would delight my private hours
1	with music or with poem where so soon
1	as in our native language can i find
1	that solace all our law and story strewed
1	with hymns our psalms with artful terms inscribed 
1	our hebrew songs and harps in babylon
1	that pleased so well our victor s ear declare
1	that rather greece from us these arts derived 
1	ill imitated while they loudest sing
1	the vices of their deities and their own 
1	in fable hymn or song so personating
1	their gods ridiculous and themselves past shame 
1	remove their swelling epithetes thick laid
1	as varnish on a harlot s cheek the rest 
1	thin sown with aught of profit or delight 
1	will far be found unworthy to compare
1	with sion s songs to all true tastes excelling 
1	where god is praised aright and godlike men 
1	 such are from god inspired not such from thee 
1	unless where moral virtue is expressed
1	by light of nature not in all quite lost 
1	their orators thou then extoll st as those
1	the top of eloquence statists indeed 
1	and lovers of their country as may seem 
1	but herein to our prophets far beneath 
1	as men divinely taught and better teaching
1	the solid rules of civil government 
1	in their majestic unaffected style 
1	than all the oratory of greece and rome 
1	in them is plainest taught and easiest learnt 
1	what makes a nation happy and keeps it so 
1	what ruins kingdoms and lays cities flat 
1	these only with our law best form a king 
1	so spake the son of god but satan now
1	quite at a loss for all his darts were spent 
1	thus to our saviour with stern brow replied 
1	 since neither wealth nor honour arms nor arts 
1	kingdom nor empire pleases thee nor aught
1	by me proposed in life contemplative
1	or active tended on by glory or fame 
1	what dost thou in this world the wilderness
1	for thee is fittest place i found thee there 
1	and thither will return thee yet remember
1	what i foretell thee soon thou shalt have cause
1	to wish thou never hadst rejected thus
1	nicely or cautiously my offered aid 
1	which would have set thee in short time with ease
1	on david s throne or throne of all the world 
1	now at full age fulness of time thy season 
1	when prophecies of thee are best fulfilled 
1	now contrary if i read aught in heaven 
1	or heaven write aught of fate by what the stars
1	voluminous or single characters
1	in their conjunction met give me to spell 
1	sorrows and labours opposition hate 
1	attends thee scorns reproaches injuries 
1	violence and stripes and lastly cruel death 
1	a kingdom they portend thee but what kingdom 
1	real or allegoric i discern not 
1	nor when eternal sure as without end 
1	without beginning for no date prefixed
1	directs me in the starry rubric set 
1	so saying he took for still he knew his power
1	not yet expired and to the wilderness
1	brought back the son of god and left him there 
1	feigning to disappear darkness now rose 
1	as daylight sunk and brought in louring night 
1	her shadowy offspring unsubstantial both 
1	privation mere of light and absent day 
1	our saviour meek and with untroubled mind
1	after hisaerie jaunt though hurried sore 
1	hungry and cold betook him to his rest 
1	wherever under some concourse of shades 
1	whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield
1	from dews and damps of night his sheltered head 
1	but sheltered slept in vain for at his head
1	the tempter watched and soon with ugly dreams
1	disturbed his sleep and either tropic now
1	 gan thunder and both ends of heaven the clouds
1	from many a horrid rift abortive poured
1	fierce rain with lightning mixed water with fire 
1	in ruin reconciled nor slept the winds
1	within their stony caves but rushed abroad
1	from the four hinges of the world and fell
1	on the vexed wilderness whose tallest pines 
1	though rooted deep as high and sturdiest oaks 
1	bowed their stiff necks loaden with stormy blasts 
1	or torn up sheer ill wast thou shrouded then 
1	o patient son of god yet only stood st
1	unshaken nor yet staid the terror there 
1	infernal ghosts and hellish furies round
1	environed thee some howled some yelled some shrieked 
1	some bent at thee their fiery darts while thou
1	sat st unappalled in calm and sinless peace 
1	thus passed the night so foul till morning fair
1	came forth with pilgrim steps in amice grey 
1	who with her radiant finger stilled the roar
1	of thunder chased the clouds and laid the winds 
1	and griesly spectres which the fiend had raised
1	to tempt the son of god with terrors dire 
1	and now the sun with more effectual beams
1	had cheered the face of earth and dried the wet
1	from drooping plant or dropping tree the birds 
1	who all things now behold more fresh and green 
1	after a night of storm so ruinous 
1	cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray 
1	to gratulate the sweet return of morn 
1	nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn 
1	was absent after all his mischief done 
1	the prince of darkness glad would also seem
1	of this fair change and to our saviour came 
1	yet with no new device they all were spent 
1	rather by this his last affront resolved 
1	desperate of better course to vent his rage
1	and mad despite to be so oft repelled 
1	him walking on a sunny hill he found 
1	backed on the north and west by a thick wood 
1	out of the wood he starts in wonted shape 
1	and in a careless mood thus to him said 
1	 fair morning yet betides thee son of god 
1	after a dismal night i heard the wrack 
1	as earth and sky would mingle but myself
1	was distant and these flaws though mortals fear them 
1	as dangerous to the pillared frame of heaven 
1	or to the earth s dark basis underneath 
1	are to the main as inconsiderable
1	and harmless if not wholesome as a sneeze
1	to man s less universe and soon are gone 
1	yet as being ofttimes noxious where they light
1	on man beast plant wasteful and turbulent 
1	like turbulencies in the affairs of men 
1	over whose heads they roar and seem to point 
1	they oft fore signify and threaten ill 
1	this tempest at this desert most was bent 
1	of men at thee for only thou here dwell st 
1	did i not tell thee if thou didst reject
1	the perfect season offered with my aid
1	to win thy destined seat but wilt prolong
1	all to the push of fate pursue thy way
1	of gaining david s throne no man knows when
1	 for both the when and how is nowhere told 
1	thou shalt be what thou art ordained no doubt 
1	for angels have proclaimed it but concealing
1	the time and means each act is rightliest done
1	not when it must but when it may be best 
1	if thou observe not this be sure to find
1	what i foretold thee many a hard assay
1	of dangers and adversities and pains 
1	ere thou of israel s sceptre get fast hold 
1	whereof this ominous night that closed thee round 
1	so many terrors voices prodigies 
1	may warn thee as a sure foregoing sign 
1	so talked he while the son of god went on 
1	and staid not but in brief him answered thus 
1	 me worse than wet thou find st not other harm
1	those terrors which thou speak st of did me none 
1	i never feared they could though noising loud
1	and threatening nigh what they can do as signs
1	betokening or ill boding i contemn
1	as false portents not sent from god but thee 
1	who knowing i shall reign past thy preventing 
1	obtrud st thy offered aid that i accepting 
1	at least might seem to hold all power of thee 
1	ambitious spirit and would st be thought my god 
1	and storm st refused thinking to terrify
1	me to thy will desist thou art discerned 
1	and toil st in vain nor me in vain molest 
1	to whom the fiend now swoln with rage replied 
1	 then hear o son of david virgin born 
1	for son of god to me is yet in doubt 
1	of the messiah i have heard foretold
1	by all the prophets of thy birth at length
1	announced by gabriel with the first i knew 
1	and of the angelic song in bethlehem field 
1	on thy birth night that sung thee saviour born 
1	from that time seldom have i ceased to eye
1	thy infancy thy childhood and thy youth 
1	thy manhood last though yet in private bred 
1	till at the ford of jordan whither all
1	flocked to the baptist i among the rest
1	 though not to be baptized by voice from heaven
1	heard thee pronounced the son of god beloved 
1	thenceforth i thought thee worth my nearer view
1	and narrower scrutiny that i might learn
1	in what degree or meaning thou art called
1	the son of god which bears no single sense 
1	the son of god i also am or was 
1	and if i was i am relation stands 
1	all men are sons of god yet thee i thought
1	in some respect far higher so declared 
1	therefore i watched thy footsteps from that hour 
1	and followed thee still on to this waste wild 
1	where by all best conjectures i collect
1	thou art to be my fatal enemy 
1	good reason then if i beforehand seek
1	to understand my adversary who
1	and what he is his wisdom power intent 
1	by parle or composition truce or league 
1	to win him or win from him what i can 
1	and opportunity i here have had
1	to try thee sift thee and confess have found thee
1	proof against all temptation as a rock
1	of adamant and as a centre firm
1	to the utmost of mere man both wise and good 
1	not more for honours riches kingdoms glory 
1	have been before contemned and may again 
1	therefore to know what more thou art than man 
1	worth naming the son of god by voice from heaven 
1	another method i must now begin 
1	so saying he caught him up and without wing
1	of hippogrif bore through the air sublime 
1	over the wilderness and o er the plain 
1	till underneath them fair jerusalem 
1	the holy city lifted high her towers 
1	and higher yet the glorious temple reared
1	her pile far off appearing like a mount
1	of alablaster topt with golden spires 
1	there on the highest pinnacle he set
1	the son of god and added thus in scorn 
1	 there stand if thou wilt stand to stand upright
1	will ask thee skill i to thy father s house
1	have brought thee and highest placed highest is best 
1	now shew thy progeny if not to stand 
1	cast thyself down safely if son of god 
1	for it is written he will give command
1	concerning thee to his angels in their hands
1	they shall uplift thee lest at any time
1	thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone 
1	to whom thus jesus also it is written 
1	 tempt not the lord thy god he said and stood 
1	but satan smitten with amazement fell 
1	as when earth s son antaeus to compare
1	small things with greatest in irassa strove
1	with jove s alcides and oft foiled still rose 
1	receiving from his mother earth new strength 
1	fresh from his fall and fiercer grapple joined 
1	throttled at length in the air expired and fell 
1	so after many a foil the tempter proud 
1	renewing fresh assaults amidst his pride
1	fell whence he stood to see his victor fall 
1	and as that theban monster that proposed
1	her riddle and him who solved it not devoured 
1	that once found out and solved for grief and spite
1	cast herself headlong from the ismenian steep 
1	so strook with dread and anguish fell the fiend 
1	and to his crew that sat consulting brought
1	joyless triumphals of his hoped success 
1	ruin and desperation and dismay 
1	who durst so proudly tempt the son of god 
1	so satan fell and straight a fiery globe
1	of angels on full sail of wing flew nigh 
1	who on their plumy vans received him soft
1	from his uneasy station and upbore 
1	as on a floating couch through the blithe air 
1	then in a flowery valley set him down
1	on a green bank and set before him spread
1	a table of celestial food divine
1	ambrosial fruits fetched from the tree of life 
1	and from the fount of life ambrosial drink 
1	that soon refreshed him wearied and repaired
1	what hunger if aught hunger had impaired 
1	or thirst and as he fed angelic quires
1	sung heavenly anthems of his victory
1	over temptation and the tempter proud 
1	 true image of the father whether throned
1	in the bosom of bliss and light of light
1	conceiving or remote from heaven enshrined
1	in fleshly tabernacle and human form 
1	wandering the wilderness whatever place 
1	habit or state or motion still expressing
1	the son of god with godlike force endued
1	against the attempter of thy father s throne
1	and thief of paradise him long of old
1	thou didst debel and down from heaven cast
1	with all his army now thou hast avenged
1	supplanted adam and by vanquishing
1	temptation hast regained lost paradise 
1	and frustrated the conquest fraudulent 
1	he never more henceforth will dare set foot
1	in paradise to tempt his snares are broke 
1	for though that seat of earthly bliss be failed 
1	a fairer paradise is founded now
1	for adam and his chosen sons whom thou 
1	a saviour art come down to reinstall 
1	where they shall dwell secure when time shall be 
1	of tempter and temptation without fear 
1	but thou infernal serpent shalt not long
1	rule in the clouds like an autumnal star 
1	or lightning thou shalt fall from heaven trod down
1	under his feet for proof ere this thou feel st
1	thy wound yet not thy last and deadliest wound 
1	by this repulse received and hold st in hell
1	no triumph in all her gates abaddon rues
1	thy bold attempt hereafter learn with awe
1	to dread the son of god he all unarmed 
1	shall chase thee with the terror of his voice 
1	from thy demoniac holds possession foul 
1	thee and thy legions yelling they shall fly 
1	and beg to hide them in a herd of swine 
1	lest he command them down into the deep 
1	bound and to torment sent before their time 
1	hail son of the most high heir of both worlds 
1	queller of satan on thy glorious work
1	now enter and begin to save mankind 
1	thus they the son of god our saviour meek 
1	sung victor and from heavenly feast refreshed 
1	brought on his way with joy he unobserved 
1	home to his mother s house private returned 
1	of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
1	brought death into the world and all our woe 
1	with loss of eden till one greater man
1	restore us and regain the blissful seat 
1	sing heavenly muse that on the secret top
1	of oreb or of sinai didst inspire
1	that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
1	in the beginning how the heavens and earth
1	rose out of chaos or if sion hill
1	delight thee more and siloa s brook that flowed
1	fast by the oracle of god i thence
1	invoke thy aid to my adventurous song 
1	that with no middle flight intends to soar
1	above th aonian mount while it pursues
1	things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme 
1	and chiefly thou o spirit that dost prefer
1	before all temples th upright heart and pure 
1	instruct me for thou know st thou from the first
1	wast present and with mighty wings outspread 
1	dove like sat st brooding on the vast abyss 
1	and mad st it pregnant what in me is dark
1	illumine what is low raise and support 
1	that to the height of this great argument 
1	i may assert eternal providence 
1	and justify the ways of god to men 
1	say first for heaven hides nothing from thy view 
1	nor the deep tract of hell say first what cause
1	moved our grand parents in that happy state 
1	favoured of heaven so highly to fall off
1	from their creator and transgress his will
1	for one restraint lords of the world besides 
1	who first seduced them to that foul revolt 
1	th infernal serpent he it was whose guile 
1	stirred up with envy and revenge deceived
1	the mother of mankind what time his pride
1	had cast him out from heaven with all his host
1	of rebel angels by whose aid aspiring
1	to set himself in glory above his peers 
1	he trusted to have equalled the most high 
1	if he opposed and with ambitious aim
1	against the throne and monarchy of god 
1	raised impious war in heaven and battle proud 
1	with vain attempt him the almighty power
1	hurled headlong flaming from th ethereal sky 
1	with hideous ruin and combustion down
1	to bottomless perdition there to dwell
1	in adamantine chains and penal fire 
1	who durst defy th omnipotent to arms 
1	nine times the space that measures day and night
1	to mortal men he with his horrid crew 
1	lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf 
1	confounded though immortal but his doom
1	reserved him to more wrath for now the thought
1	both of lost happiness and lasting pain
1	torments him round he throws his baleful eyes 
1	that witnessed huge affliction and dismay 
1	mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate 
1	at once as far as angels ken he views
1	the dismal situation waste and wild 
1	a dungeon horrible on all sides round 
1	as one great furnace flamed yet from those flames
1	no light but rather darkness visible
1	served only to discover sights of woe 
1	regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace
1	and rest can never dwell hope never comes
1	that comes to all but torture without end
1	still urges and a fiery deluge fed
1	with ever burning sulphur unconsumed 
1	such place eternal justice has prepared
1	for those rebellious here their prison ordained
1	in utter darkness and their portion set 
1	as far removed from god and light of heaven
1	as from the centre thrice to th utmost pole 
1	oh how unlike the place from whence they fell 
1	there the companions of his fall o erwhelmed
1	with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire 
1	he soon discerns and weltering by his side 
1	one next himself in power and next in crime 
1	long after known in palestine and named
1	beelzebub to whom th arch enemy 
1	and thence in heaven called satan with bold words
1	breaking the horrid silence thus began 
1	 if thou beest he but o how fallen how changed
1	from him who in the happy realms of light
1	clothed with transcendent brightness didst outshine
1	myriads though bright if he whom mutual league 
1	united thoughts and counsels equal hope
1	and hazard in the glorious enterprise
1	joined with me once now misery hath joined
1	in equal ruin into what pit thou seest
1	from what height fallen so much the stronger proved
1	he with his thunder and till then who knew
1	the force of those dire arms yet not for those 
1	nor what the potent victor in his rage
1	can else inflict do i repent or change 
1	though changed in outward lustre that fixed mind 
1	and high disdain from sense of injured merit 
1	that with the mightiest raised me to contend 
1	and to the fierce contentions brought along
1	innumerable force of spirits armed 
1	that durst dislike his reign and me preferring 
1	his utmost power with adverse power opposed
1	in dubious battle on the plains of heaven 
1	and shook his throne what though the field be lost 
1	all is not lost the unconquerable will 
1	and study of revenge immortal hate 
1	and courage never to submit or yield 
1	and what is else not to be overcome 
1	that glory never shall his wrath or might
1	extort from me to bow and sue for grace
1	with suppliant knee and deify his power
1	who from the terror of this arm so late
1	doubted his empire that were low indeed 
1	that were an ignominy and shame beneath
1	this downfall since by fate the strength of gods 
1	and this empyreal sybstance cannot fail 
1	since through experience of this great event 
1	in arms not worse in foresight much advanced 
1	we may with more successful hope resolve
1	to wage by force or guile eternal war 
1	irreconcilable to our grand foe 
1	who now triumphs and in th excess of joy
1	sole reigning holds the tyranny of heaven 
1	so spake th apostate angel though in pain 
1	vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair 
1	and him thus answered soon his bold compeer 
1	 o prince o chief of many throned powers
1	that led th embattled seraphim to war
1	under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds
1	fearless endangered heaven s perpetual king 
1	and put to proof his high supremacy 
1	whether upheld by strength or chance or fate 
1	too well i see and rue the dire event
1	that with sad overthrow and foul defeat 
1	hath lost us heaven and all this mighty host
1	in horrible destruction laid thus low 
1	as far as gods and heavenly essences
1	can perish for the mind and spirit remains
1	invincible and vigour soon returns 
1	though all our glory extinct and happy state
1	here swallowed up in endless misery 
1	but what if he our conqueror whom i now
1	of force believe almighty since no less
1	than such could have o erpowered such force as ours 
1	have left us this our spirit and strength entire 
1	strongly to suffer and support our pains 
1	that we may so suffice his vengeful ire 
1	or do him mightier service as his thralls
1	by right of war whate er his business be 
1	here in the heart of hell to work in fire 
1	or do his errands in the gloomy deep 
1	what can it the avail though yet we feel
1	strength undiminished or eternal being
1	to undergo eternal punishment 
1	whereto with speedy words th arch fiend replied 
1	 fallen cherub to be weak is miserable 
1	doing or suffering but of this be sure 
1	to do aught good never will be our task 
1	but ever to do ill our sole delight 
1	as being the contrary to his high will
1	whom we resist if then his providence
1	out of our evil seek to bring forth good 
1	our labour must be to pervert that end 
1	and out of good still to find means of evil 
1	which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps
1	shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb
1	his inmost counsels from their destined aim 
1	but see the angry victor hath recalled
1	his ministers of vengeance and pursuit
1	back to the gates of heaven the sulphurous hail 
1	shot after us in storm o erblown hath laid
1	the fiery surge that from the precipice
1	of heaven received us falling and the thunder 
1	winged with red lightning and impetuous rage 
1	perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now
1	to bellow through the vast and boundless deep 
1	let us not slip th occasion whether scorn
1	or satiate fury yield it from our foe 
1	seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild 
1	the seat of desolation void of light 
1	save what the glimmering of these livid flames
1	casts pale and dreadful thither let us tend
1	from off the tossing of these fiery waves 
1	there rest if any rest can harbour there 
1	and re assembling our afflicted powers 
1	consult how we may henceforth most offend
1	our enemy our own loss how repair 
1	how overcome this dire calamity 
1	what reinforcement we may gain from hope 
1	if not what resolution from despair 
1	thus satan talking to his nearest mate 
1	with head uplift above the wave and eyes
1	that sparkling blazed his other parts besides
1	prone on the flood extended long and large 
1	lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge
1	as whom the fables name of monstrous size 
1	titanian or earth born that warred on jove 
1	briareos or typhon whom the den
1	by ancient tarsus held or that sea beast
1	leviathan which god of all his works
1	created hugest that swim th ocean stream 
1	him haply slumbering on the norway foam 
1	the pilot of some small night foundered skiff 
1	deeming some island oft as seamen tell 
1	with fixed anchor in his scaly rind 
1	moors by his side under the lee while night
1	invests the sea and wished morn delays 
1	so stretched out huge in length the arch fiend lay 
1	chained on the burning lake nor ever thence
1	had risen or heaved his head but that the will
1	and high permission of all ruling heaven
1	left him at large to his own dark designs 
1	that with reiterated crimes he might
1	heap on himself damnation while he sought
1	evil to others and enraged might see
1	how all his malice served but to bring forth
1	infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn
1	on man by him seduced but on himself
1	treble confusion wrath and vengeance poured 
1	forthwith upright he rears from off the pool
1	his mighty stature on each hand the flames
1	driven backward slope their pointing spires and rolled
1	in billows leave i th midst a horrid vale 
1	then with expanded wings he steers his flight
1	aloft incumbent on the dusky air 
1	that felt unusual weight till on dry land
1	he lights if it were land that ever burned
1	with solid as the lake with liquid fire 
1	and such appeared in hue as when the force
1	of subterranean wind transports a hill
1	torn from pelorus or the shattered side
1	of thundering etna whose combustible
1	and fuelled entrails thence conceiving fire 
1	sublimed with mineral fury aid the winds 
1	and leave a singed bottom all involved
1	with stench and smoke such resting found the sole
1	of unblest feet him followed his next mate 
1	both glorying to have scaped the stygian flood
1	as gods and by their own recovered strength 
1	not by the sufferance of supernal power 
1	 is this the region this the soil the clime 
1	said then the lost archangel this the seat
1	that we must change for heaven this mournful gloom
1	for that celestial light be it so since he
1	who now is sovereign can dispose and bid
1	what shall be right farthest from him is best
1	whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme
1	above his equals farewell happy fields 
1	where joy for ever dwells hail horrors hail 
1	infernal world and thou profoundest hell 
1	receive thy new possessor one who brings
1	a mind not to be changed by place or time 
1	the mind is its own place and in itself
1	can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven 
1	what matter where if i be still the same 
1	and what i should be all but less than he
1	whom thunder hath made greater here at least
1	we shall be free th almighty hath not built
1	here for his envy will not drive us hence 
1	here we may reign secure and in my choice 
1	to reign is worth ambition though in hell 
1	better to reign in hell than serve in heaven 
1	but wherefore let we then our faithful friends 
1	th associates and co partners of our loss 
1	lie thus astonished on th oblivious pool 
1	and call them not to share with us their part
1	in this unhappy mansion or once more
1	with rallied arms to try what may be yet
1	regained in heaven or what more lost in hell 
1	so satan spake and him beelzebub
1	thus answered leader of those armies bright
1	which but th omnipotent none could have foiled 
1	if once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge
1	of hope in fears and dangers heard so oft
1	in worst extremes and on the perilous edge
1	of battle when it raged in all assaults
1	their surest signal they will soon resume
1	new courage and revive though now they lie
1	grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire 
1	as we erewhile astounded and amazed 
1	no wonder fallen such a pernicious height 
1	he scare had ceased when the superior fiend
1	was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield 
1	ethereal temper massy large and round 
1	behind him cast the broad circumference
1	hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb
1	through optic glass the tuscan artist views
1	at evening from the top of fesole 
1	or in valdarno to descry new lands 
1	rivers or mountains in her spotty globe 
1	his spear to equal which the tallest pine
1	hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast
1	of some great ammiral were but a wand 
1	he walked with to support uneasy steps
1	over the burning marl not like those steps
1	on heaven s azure and the torrid clime
1	smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire 
1	nathless he so endured till on the beach
1	of that inflamed sea he stood and called
1	his legions angel forms who lay entranced
1	thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
1	in vallombrosa where th etrurian shades
1	high over arched embower or scattered sedge
1	afloat when with fierce winds orion armed
1	hath vexed the red sea coast whose waves o erthrew
1	busiris and his memphian chivalry 
1	while with perfidious hatred they pursued
1	the sojourners of goshen who beheld
1	from the safe shore their floating carcases
1	and broken chariot wheels so thick bestrown 
1	abject and lost lay these covering the flood 
1	under amazement of their hideous change 
1	he called so loud that all the hollow deep
1	of hell resounded princes potentates 
1	warriors the flower of heaven once yours now lost 
1	if such astonishment as this can seize
1	eternal spirits or have ye chosen this place
1	after the toil of battle to repose
1	your wearied virtue for the ease you find
1	to slumber here as in the vales of heaven 
1	or in this abject posture have ye sworn
1	to adore the conqueror who now beholds
1	cherub and seraph rolling in the flood
1	with scattered arms and ensigns till anon
1	his swift pursuers from heaven gates discern
1	th advantage and descending tread us down
1	thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts
1	transfix us to the bottom of this gulf 
1	awake arise or be for ever fallen 
1	they heard and were abashed and up they sprung
1	upon the wing as when men wont to watch
1	on duty sleeping found by whom they dread 
1	rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake 
1	nor did they not perceive the evil plight
1	in which they were or the fierce pains not feel 
1	yet to their general s voice they soon obeyed
1	innumerable as when the potent rod
1	waved round the coast up called a pitchy cloud
1	of locusts warping on the eastern wind 
1	that o er the realm of impious pharaoh hung
1	like night and darkened all the land of nile 
1	so numberless were those bad angels seen
1	hovering on wing under the cope of hell 
1	 twixt upper nether and surrounding fires 
1	till as a signal given th uplifted spear
1	of their great sultan waving to direct
1	their course in even balance down they light
1	on the firm brimstone and fill all the plain 
1	a multitude like which the populous north
1	poured never from her frozen loins to pass
1	rhene or the danaw when her barbarous sons
1	came like a deluge on the south and spread
1	beneath gibraltar to the libyan sands 
1	forthwith form every squadron and each band 
1	the heads and leaders thither haste where stood
1	their great commander godlike shapes and forms
1	excelling human princely dignities 
1	and powers that erst in heaven sat on thrones 
1	though on their names in heavenly records now
1	be no memorial blotted out and rased
1	by their rebellion from the books of life 
1	nor had they yet among the sons of eve
1	got them new names till wandering o er the earth 
1	through god s high sufferance for the trial of man 
1	by falsities and lies the greatest part
1	of mankind they corrupted to forsake
1	god their creator and th invisible
1	glory of him that made them to transform
1	oft to the image of a brute adorned
1	with gay religions full of pomp and gold 
1	and devils to adore for deities 
1	then were they known to men by various names 
1	and various idols through the heathen world 
1	say muse their names then known who first who last 
1	roused from the slumber on that fiery couch 
1	at their great emperor s call as next in worth
1	came singly where he stood on the bare strand 
1	while the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof 
1	the chief were those who from the pit of hell
1	roaming to seek their prey on earth durst fix
1	their seats long after next the seat of god 
1	their altars by his altar gods adored
1	among the nations round and durst abide
1	jehovah thundering out of sion throned
1	between the cherubim yea often placed
1	within his sanctuary itself their shrines 
1	abominations and with cursed things
1	his holy rites and solemn feasts profaned 
1	and with their darkness durst affront his light 
1	first moloch horrid king besmeared with blood
1	of human sacrifice and parents tears 
1	though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud 
1	their children s cries unheard that passed through fire
1	to his grim idol him the ammonite
1	worshiped in rabba and her watery plain 
1	in argob and in basan to the stream
1	of utmost arnon nor content with such
1	audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart
1	of solomon he led by fraud to build
1	his temple right against the temple of god
1	on that opprobrious hill and made his grove
1	the pleasant valley of hinnom tophet thence
1	and black gehenna called the type of hell 
1	next chemos th obscene dread of moab s sons 
1	from aroar to nebo and the wild
1	of southmost abarim in hesebon
1	and horonaim seon s real beyond
1	the flowery dale of sibma clad with vines 
1	peor his other name when he enticed
1	israel in sittim on their march from nile 
1	to do him wanton rites which cost them woe 
1	yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged
1	even to that hill of scandal by the grove
1	of moloch homicide lust hard by hate 
1	till good josiah drove them thence to hell 
1	with these came they who from the bordering flood
1	of old euphrates to the brook that parts
1	of baalim and ashtaroth those male 
1	these feminine for spirits when they please 
1	can either sex assume or both so soft
1	and uncompounded is their essence pure 
1	not tried or manacled with joint or limb 
1	nor founded on the brittle strength of bones 
1	like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose 
1	dilated or condensed bright or obscure 
1	can execute their airy purposes 
1	and works of love or enmity fulfil 
1	for those the race of israel oft forsook
1	their living strength and unfrequented left
1	his righteous altar bowing lowly down
1	to bestial gods for which their heads as low
1	bowed down in battle sunk before the spear
1	of despicable foes with these in troop
1	came astoreth whom the phoenicians called
1	astarte queen of heaven with crescent horns 
1	to whose bright image nightly by the moon
1	sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs 
1	in sion also not unsung where stood
1	her temple on th offensive mountain built
1	by that uxorious king whose heart though large 
1	beguiled by fair idolatresses fell
1	to idols foul thammuz came next behind 
1	whose annual wound in lebanon allured
1	the syrian damsels to lament his fate
1	in amorous ditties all a summer s day 
1	while smooth adonis from his native rock
1	ran purple to the sea supposed with blood
1	of thammuz yearly wounded the love tale
1	infected sion s daughters with like heat 
1	whose wanton passions in the sacred porch
1	ezekiel saw when by the vision led 
1	his eye surveyed the dark idolatries
1	of alienated judah next came one
1	who mourned in earnest when the captive ark
1	maimed his brute image head and hands lopt off 
1	in his own temple on the grunsel edge 
1	where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers 
1	and downward fish yet had his temple high
1	reared in azotus dreaded through the coast
1	and accaron and gaza s frontier bounds 
1	him followed rimmon whose delightful seat
1	was fair damascus on the fertile banks
1	of abbana and pharphar lucid streams 
1	he also against the house of god was bold 
1	a leper once he lost and gained a king 
1	ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew
1	god s altar to disparage and displace
1	for one of syrian mode whereon to burn
1	his odious offerings and adore the gods
1	whom he had vanquished after these appeared
1	a crew who under names of old renown 
1	osiris isis orus and their train 
1	with monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
1	their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
1	rather than human nor did israel scape
1	th infection when their borrowed gold composed
1	the calf in oreb and the rebel king
1	doubled that sin in bethel and in dan 
1	likening his maker to the grazed ox 
1	jehovah who in one night when he passed
1	both her first born and all her bleating gods 
1	belial came last than whom a spirit more lewd
1	fell not from heaven or more gross to love
1	vice for itself to him no temple stood
1	or altar smoked yet who more oft than he
1	in temples and at altars when the priest
1	turns atheist as did eli s sons who filled
1	with lust and violence the house of god 
1	in courts and palaces he also reigns 
1	and in luxurious cities where the noise
1	of riot ascends above their loftiest towers 
1	and injury and outrage and when night
1	darkens the streets then wander forth the sons
1	of belial flown with insolence and wine 
1	witness the streets of sodom and that night
1	in gibeah when the hospitable door
1	exposed a matron to avoid worse rape 
1	these were the prime in order and in might 
1	the rest were long to tell though far renowned
1	th ionian gods of javan s issue held
1	gods yet confessed later than heaven and earth 
1	their boasted parents titan heaven s first born 
1	with his enormous brood and birthright seized
1	by younger saturn he from mightier jove 
1	his own and rhea s son like measure found 
1	so jove usurping reigned these first in crete
1	and ida known thence on the snowy top
1	of cold olympus ruled the middle air 
1	their highest heaven or on the delphian cliff 
1	or in dodona and through all the bounds
1	of doric land or who with saturn old
1	fled over adria to th hesperian fields 
1	and o er the celtic roamed the utmost isles 
1	all these and more came flocking but with looks
1	downcast and damp yet such wherein appeared
1	obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their chief
1	not in despair to have found themselves not lost
1	in loss itself which on his countenance cast
1	like doubtful hue but he his wonted pride
1	soon recollecting with high words that bore
1	semblance of worth not substance gently raised
1	their fainting courage and dispelled their fears 
1	then straight commands that at the warlike sound
1	of trumpets loud and clarions be upreared
1	his mighty standard that proud honour claimed
1	azazel as his right a cherub tall 
1	who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled
1	th imperial ensign which full high advanced 
1	shone like a meteor streaming to the wind 
1	with gems and golden lustre rich emblazed 
1	seraphic arms and trophies all the while
1	sonorous metal blowing martial sounds 
1	at which the universal host up sent
1	a shout that tore hell s concave and beyond
1	frighted the reign of chaos and old night 
1	all in a moment through the gloom were seen
1	ten thousand banners rise into the air 
1	with orient colours waving with them rose
1	a forest huge of spears and thronging helms
1	appeared and serried shields in thick array
1	of depth immeasurable anon they move
1	in perfect phalanx to the dorian mood
1	of flutes and soft recorders such as raised
1	to height of noblest temper heroes old
1	arming to battle and instead of rage
1	deliberate valour breathed firm and unmoved
1	with dread of death to flight or foul retreat 
1	nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
1	with solemn touches troubled thoughts and chase
1	anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
1	from mortal or immortal minds thus they 
1	breathing united force with fixed thought 
1	moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed
1	their painful steps o er the burnt soil and now
1	advanced in view they stand a horrid front
1	of dreadful length and dazzling arms in guise
1	of warriors old with ordered spear and shield 
1	awaiting what command their mighty chief
1	had to impose he through the armed files
1	darts his experienced eye and soon traverse
1	the whole battalion views their order due 
1	their visages and stature as of gods 
1	their number last he sums and now his heart
1	distends with pride and hardening in his strength 
1	glories for never since created man 
1	met such embodied force as named with these 
1	could merit more than that small infantry
1	warred on by cranes though all the giant brood
1	of phlegra with th heroic race were joined
1	that fought at thebes and ilium on each side
1	mixed with auxiliar gods and what resounds
1	in fable or romance of uther s son 
1	begirt with british and armoric knights 
1	and all who since baptized or infidel 
1	or whom biserta sent from afric shore
1	when charlemain with all his peerage fell
1	by fontarabbia thus far these beyond
1	compare of mortal prowess yet observed
1	their dread commander he above the rest
1	in shape and gesture proudly eminent 
1	stood like a tower his form had yet not lost
1	all her original brightness nor appeared
1	less than archangel ruined and th excess
1	of glory obscured as when the sun new risen
1	looks through the horizontal misty air
1	shorn of his beams or from behind the moon 
1	in dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds
1	on half the nations and with fear of change
1	perplexes monarchs darkened so yet shone
1	above them all th archangel but his face
1	deep scars of thunder had intrenched and care
1	sat on his faded cheek but under brows
1	of dauntless courage and considerate pride
1	waiting revenge cruel his eye but cast
1	signs of remorse and passion to behold
1	the fellows of his crime the followers rather
1	 far other once beheld in bliss condemned
1	for ever now to have their lot in pain 
1	millions of spirits for his fault amerced
1	of heaven and from eternal splendours flung
1	for his revolt yet faithful how they stood 
1	their glory withered as when heaven s fire
1	hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines 
1	with singed top their stately growth though bare 
1	stands on the blasted heath he now prepared
1	to speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend
1	from wing to wing and half enclose him round
1	with all his peers attention held them mute 
1	thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn 
1	tears such as angels weep burst forth at last
1	words interwove with sighs found out their way 
1	 o myriads of immortal spirits o powers
1	matchless but with th almighty and that strife
1	was not inglorious though th event was dire 
1	as this place testifies and this dire change 
1	hateful to utter but what power of mind 
1	forseeing or presaging from the depth
1	of knowledge past or present could have feared
1	how such united force of gods how such
1	as stood like these could ever know repulse 
1	for who can yet believe though after loss 
1	that all these puissant legions whose exile
1	hath emptied heaven shall fail to re ascend 
1	self raised and repossess their native seat 
1	for me be witness all the host of heaven 
1	if counsels different or danger shunned
1	by me have lost our hopes but he who reigns
1	monarch in heaven till then as one secure
1	sat on his throne upheld by old repute 
1	consent or custom and his regal state
1	put forth at full but still his strength concealed 
1	which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall 
1	henceforth his might we know and know our own 
1	so as not either to provoke or dread
1	new war provoked our better part remains
1	to work in close design by fraud or guile 
1	what force effected not that he no less
1	at length from us may find who overcomes
1	by force hath overcome but half his foe 
1	space may produce new worlds whereof so rife
1	there went a fame in heaven that he ere long
1	intended to create and therein plant
1	a generation whom his choice regard
1	should favour equal to the sons of heaven 
1	thither if but to pry shall be perhaps
1	our first eruption thither or elsewhere 
1	for this infernal pit shall never hold
1	celestial spirits in bondage nor th abyss
1	long under darkness cover but these thoughts
1	full counsel must mature peace is despaired 
1	for who can think submission war then war
1	open or understood must be resolved 
1	he spake and to confirm his words outflew
1	millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs
1	of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze
1	far round illumined hell highly they raged
1	against the highest and fierce with grasped arms
1	clashed on their sounding shields the din of war 
1	hurling defiance toward the vault of heaven 
1	there stood a hill not far whose grisly top
1	belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire
1	shone with a glossy scurf undoubted sign
1	that in his womb was hid metallic ore 
1	the work of sulphur thither winged with speed 
1	a numerous brigade hastened as when bands
1	forerun the royal camp to trench a field 
1	or cast a rampart mammon led them on 
1	mammon the least erected spirit that fell
1	from heaven for even in heaven his looks and thoughts
1	were always downward bent admiring more
1	the riches of heaven s pavement trodden gold 
1	than aught divine or holy else enjoyed
1	in vision beatific by him first
1	men also and by his suggestion taught 
1	ransacked the centre and with impious hands
1	rifled the bowels of their mother earth
1	for treasures better hid soon had his crew
1	opened into the hill a spacious wound 
1	and digged out ribs of gold let none admire
1	that riches grow in hell that soil may best
1	deserve the precious bane and here let those
1	who boast in mortal things and wondering tell
1	of babel and the works of memphian kings 
1	learn how their greatest monuments of fame
1	and strength and art are easily outdone
1	by spirits reprobate and in an hour
1	what in an age they with incessant toil
1	and hands innumerable scarce perform 
1	nigh on the plain in many cells prepared 
1	that underneath had veins of liquid fire
1	sluiced from the lake a second multitude
1	with wondrous art founded the massy ore 
1	severing each kind and scummed the bullion dross 
1	a third as soon had formed within the ground
1	a various mould and from the boiling cells
1	by strange conveyance filled each hollow nook 
1	as in an organ from one blast of wind 
1	to many a row of pipes the sound board breathes 
1	anon out of the earth a fabric huge
1	rose like an exhalation with the sound
1	of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet 
1	built like a temple where pilasters round
1	were set and doric pillars overlaid
1	with golden architrave nor did there want
1	cornice or frieze with bossy sculptures graven 
1	the roof was fretted gold not babylon
1	nor great alcairo such magnificence
1	equalled in all their glories to enshrine
1	belus or serapis their gods or seat
1	in wealth and luxury th ascending pile
1	stood fixed her stately height and straight the doors 
1	opening their brazen folds discover wide
1	within her ample spaces o er the smooth
1	and level pavement from the arched roof 
1	pendent by subtle magic many a row
1	of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed
1	with naptha and asphaltus yielded light
1	as from a sky the hasty multitude
1	admiring entered and the work some praise 
1	and some the architect his hand was known
1	in heaven by many a towered structure high 
1	where sceptred angels held their residence 
1	and sat as princes whom the supreme king
1	exalted to such power and gave to rule 
1	each in his hierarchy the orders bright 
1	nor was his name unheard or unadored
1	in ancient greece and in ausonian land
1	men called him mulciber and how he fell
1	from heaven they fabled thrown by angry jove
1	sheer o er the crystal battlements from morn
1	to noon he fell from noon to dewy eve 
1	a summer s day and with the setting sun
1	dropt from the zenith like a falling star 
1	on lemnos th aegaean isle thus they relate 
1	erring for he with this rebellious rout
1	fell long before nor aught availed him now
1	to have built in heaven high towers nor did he scape
1	by all his engines but was headlong sent 
1	with his industrious crew to build in hell 
1	meanwhile the winged heralds by command
1	of sovereign power with awful ceremony
1	and trumpet s sound throughout the host proclaim
1	a solemn council forthwith to be held
1	at pandemonium the high capital
1	of satan and his peers their summons called
1	from every band and squared regiment
1	by place or choice the worthiest they anon
1	with hundreds and with thousands trooping came
1	attended all access was thronged the gates
1	and porches wide but chief the spacious hall
1	 though like a covered field where champions bold
1	wont ride in armed and at the soldan s chair
1	defied the best of paynim chivalry
1	to mortal combat or career with lance 
1	thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air 
1	brushed with the hiss of rustling wings as bees
1	in spring time when the sun with taurus rides 
1	pour forth their populous youth about the hive
1	in clusters they among fresh dews and flowers
1	fly to and fro or on the smoothed plank 
1	the suburb of their straw built citadel 
1	new rubbed with balm expatiate and confer
1	their state affairs so thick the airy crowd
1	swarmed and were straitened till the signal given 
1	behold a wonder they but now who seemed
1	in bigness to surpass earth s giant sons 
1	now less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room
1	throng numberless like that pygmean race
1	beyond the indian mount or faery elves 
1	whose midnight revels by a forest side
1	or fountain some belated peasant sees 
1	or dreams he sees while overhead the moon
1	sits arbitress and nearer to the earth
1	wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance
1	intent with jocund music charm his ear 
1	at once with joy and fear his heart rebounds 
1	thus incorporeal spirits to smallest forms
1	reduced their shapes immense and were at large 
1	though without number still amidst the hall
1	of that infernal court but far within 
1	and in their own dimensions like themselves 
1	the great seraphic lords and cherubim
1	in close recess and secret conclave sat 
1	a thousand demi gods on golden seats 
1	frequent and full after short silence then 
1	and summons read the great consult began 
1	high on a throne of royal state which far
1	outshone the wealth or ormus and of ind 
1	or where the gorgeous east with richest hand
1	showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold 
1	satan exalted sat by merit raised
1	to that bad eminence and from despair
1	thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires
1	beyond thus high insatiate to pursue
1	vain war with heaven and by success untaught 
1	his proud imaginations thus displayed 
1	for since no deep within her gulf can hold
1	immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen 
1	i give not heaven for lost from this descent
1	celestial virtues rising will appear
1	more glorious and more dread than from no fall 
1	and trust themselves to fear no second fate 
1	me though just right and the fixed laws of heaven 
1	did first create your leader next free choice
1	with what besides in council or in fight
1	hath been achieved of merit yet this loss 
1	thus far at least recovered hath much more
1	established in a safe unenvied throne 
1	yielded with full consent the happier state
1	in heaven which follows dignity might draw
1	envy from each inferior but who here
1	will envy whom the highest place exposes
1	foremost to stand against the thunderer s aim
1	your bulwark and condemns to greatest share
1	of endless pain where there is then no good
1	for which to strive no strife can grow up there
1	from faction for none sure will claim in hell
1	precedence none whose portion is so small
1	of present pain that with ambitious mind
1	will covet more with this advantage then 
1	to union and firm faith and firm accord 
1	more than can be in heaven we now return
1	to claim our just inheritance of old 
1	surer to prosper than prosperity
1	could have assured us and by what best way 
1	whether of open war or covert guile 
1	we now debate who can advise may speak 
1	he ceased and next him moloch sceptred king 
1	stood up the strongest and the fiercest spirit
1	that fought in heaven now fiercer by despair 
1	his trust was with th eternal to be deemed
1	equal in strength and rather than be less
1	cared not to be at all with that care lost
1	went all his fear of god or hell or worse 
1	he recked not and these words thereafter spake 
1	 my sentence is for open war of wiles 
1	more unexpert i boast not them let those
1	contrive who need or when they need not now 
1	for while they sit contriving shall the rest 
1	millions that stand in arms and longing wait
1	the signal to ascend sit lingering here 
1	heaven s fugitives and for their dwelling place
1	accept this dark opprobrious den of shame 
1	the prison of his tyranny who reigns
1	by our delay no let us rather choose 
1	armed with hell flames and fury all at once
1	o er heaven s high towers to force resistless way 
1	turning our tortures into horrid arms
1	against the torturer when to meet the noise
1	of his almighty engine he shall hear
1	infernal thunder and for lightning see
1	black fire and horror shot with equal rage
1	among his angels and his throne itself
1	mixed with tartarean sulphur and strange fire 
1	his own invented torments but perhaps
1	the way seems difficult and steep to scale
1	with upright wing against a higher foe 
1	let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
1	of that forgetful lake benumb not still 
1	that in our proper motion we ascend
1	up to our native seat descent and fall
1	to us is adverse who but felt of late 
1	when the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
1	insulting and pursued us through the deep 
1	with what compulsion and laborious flight
1	we sunk thus low th ascent is easy then 
1	th event is feared should we again provoke
1	our stronger some worse way his wrath may find
1	to our destruction if there be in hell
1	fear to be worse destroyed what can be worse
1	than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned
1	in this abhorred deep to utter woe 
1	where pain of unextinguishable fire
1	must exercise us without hope of end
1	the vassals of his anger when the scourge
1	inexorably and the torturing hour 
1	calls us to penance more destroyed than thus 
1	we should be quite abolished and expire 
1	what fear we then what doubt we to incense
1	his utmost ire which to the height enraged 
1	will either quite consume us and reduce
1	to nothing this essential happier far
1	than miserable to have eternal being 
1	or if our substance be indeed divine 
1	and cannot cease to be we are at worst
1	on this side nothing and by proof we feel
1	our power sufficient to disturb his heaven 
1	and with perpetual inroads to alarm 
1	though inaccessible his fatal throne 
1	which if not victory is yet revenge 
1	he ended frowning and his look denounced
1	desperate revenge and battle dangerous
1	to less than gods on th other side up rose
1	belial in act more graceful and humane 
1	a fairer person lost not heaven he seemed
1	for dignity composed and high exploit 
1	but all was false and hollow though his tongue
1	dropped manna and could make the worse appear
1	the better reason to perplex and dash
1	maturest counsels for his thoughts were low 
1	to vice industrious but to nobler deeds
1	timorous and slothful yet he pleased the ear 
1	and with persuasive accent thus began 
1	 i should be much for open war o peers 
1	as not behind in hate if what was urged
1	main reason to persuade immediate war
1	did not dissuade me most and seem to cast
1	ominous conjecture on the whole success 
1	when he who most excels in fact of arms 
1	in what he counsels and in what excels
1	mistrustful grounds his courage on despair
1	and utter dissolution as the scope
1	of all his aim after some dire revenge 
1	first what revenge the towers of heaven are filled
1	with armed watch that render all access
1	impregnable oft on the bordering deep
1	encamp their legions or with obscure wing
1	scout far and wide into the realm of night 
1	scorning surprise or could we break our way
1	by force and at our heels all hell should rise
1	with blackest insurrection to confound
1	heaven s purest light yet our great enemy 
1	all incorruptible would on his throne
1	sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould 
1	incapable of stain would soon expel
1	her mischief and purge off the baser fire 
1	victorious thus repulsed our final hope
1	is flat despair we must exasperate
1	th almighty victor to spend all his rage 
1	and that must end us that must be our cure 
1	to be no more sad cure for who would lose 
1	though full of pain this intellectual being 
1	those thoughts that wander through eternity 
1	to perish rather swallowed up and lost
1	in the wide womb of uncreated night 
1	devoid of sense and motion and who knows 
1	let this be good whether our angry foe
1	can give it or will ever how he can
1	is doubtful that he never will is sure 
1	will he so wise let loose at once his ire 
1	belike through impotence or unaware 
1	to give his enemies their wish and end
1	them in his anger whom his anger saves
1	to punish endless wherefore cease we then 
1	say they who counsel war we are decreed 
1	reserved and destined to eternal woe 
1	whatever doing what can we suffer more 
1	what can we suffer worse is this then worst 
1	thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms 
1	what when we fled amain pursued and struck
1	with heaven s afflicting thunder and besought
1	the deep to shelter us this hell then seemed
1	a refuge from those wounds or when we lay
1	chained on the burning lake that sure was worse 
1	what if the breath that kindled those grim fires 
1	awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage 
1	and plunge us in the flames or from above
1	should intermitted vengeance arm again
1	his red right hand to plague us what if all
1	her stores were opened and this firmament
1	of hell should spout her cataracts of fire 
1	impendent horrors threatening hideous fall
1	one day upon our heads while we perhaps 
1	designing or exhorting glorious war 
1	caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled 
1	each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey
1	or racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk
1	under yon boiling ocean wrapt in chains 
1	there to converse with everlasting groans 
1	unrespited unpitied unreprieved 
1	ages of hopeless end this would be worse 
1	war therefore open or concealed alike
1	my voice dissuades for what can force or guile
1	with him or who deceive his mind whose eye
1	views all things at one view he from heaven s height
1	all these our motions vain sees and derides 
1	not more almighty to resist our might
1	than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles 
1	shall we then live thus vile the race of heaven
1	thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here
1	chains and these torments better these than worse 
1	by my advice since fate inevitable
1	subdues us and omnipotent decree 
1	the victor s will to suffer as to do 
1	our strength is equal nor the law unjust
1	that so ordains this was at first resolved 
1	if we were wise against so great a foe
1	contending and so doubtful what might fall 
1	i laugh when those who at the spear are bold
1	and venturous if that fail them shrink and fear
1	what yet they know must follow to endure
1	exile or igominy or bonds or pain 
1	the sentence of their conqueror this is now
1	our doom which if we can sustain and bear 
1	our supreme foe in time may much remit
1	his anger and perhaps thus far removed 
1	not mind us not offending satisfied
1	with what is punished whence these raging fires
1	will slacken if his breath stir not their flames 
1	our purer essence then will overcome
1	their noxious vapour or inured not feel 
1	or changed at length and to the place conformed
1	in temper and in nature will receive
1	familiar the fierce heat and void of pain 
1	this horror will grow mild this darkness light 
1	besides what hope the never ending flight
1	of future days may bring what chance what change
1	worth waiting since our present lot appears
1	for happy though but ill for ill not worst 
1	if we procure not to ourselves more woe 
1	thus belial with words clothed in reason s garb 
1	counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth 
1	not peace and after him thus mammon spake 
1	 either to disenthrone the king of heaven
1	we war if war be best or to regain
1	our own right lost him to unthrone we then
1	may hope when everlasting fate shall yield
1	to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife 
1	the former vain to hope argues as vain
1	the latter for what place can be for us
1	within heaven s bound unless heaven s lord supreme
1	we overpower suppose he should relent
1	and publish grace to all on promise made
1	of new subjection with what eyes could we
1	stand in his presence humble and receive
1	strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne
1	with warbled hymns and to his godhead sing
1	forced hallelujahs while he lordly sits
1	our envied sovereign and his altar breathes
1	ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers 
1	our servile offerings this must be our task
1	in heaven this our delight how wearisome
1	eternity so spent in worship paid
1	to whom we hate let us not then pursue 
1	by force impossible by leave obtained
1	unacceptable though in heaven our state
1	of splendid vassalage but rather seek
1	our own good from ourselves and from our own
1	live to ourselves though in this vast recess 
1	free and to none accountable preferring
1	hard liberty before the easy yoke
1	of servile pomp our greatness will appear
1	then most conspicuous when great things of small 
1	useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse 
1	we can create and in what place soe er
1	thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
1	through labour and endurance this deep world
1	of darkness do we dread how oft amidst
1	thick clouds and dark doth heaven s all ruling sire
1	choose to reside his glory unobscured 
1	and with the majesty of darkness round
1	covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar 
1	mustering their rage and heaven resembles hell 
1	as he our darkness cannot we his light
1	imitate when we please this desert soil
1	wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold 
1	nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
1	magnificence and what can heaven show more 
1	our torments also may in length of time 
1	become our elements these piercing fires
1	as soft as now severe our temper changed
1	into their temper which must needs remove
1	the sensible of pain all things invite
1	to peaceful counsels and the settled state
1	of order how in safety best we may
1	compose our present evils with regard
1	of what we are and where dismissing quite
1	all thoughts of war ye have what i advise 
1	he scarce had finished when such murmur filled
1	th assembly as when hollow rocks retain
1	the sound of blustering winds which all night long
1	had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull
1	seafaring men o erwatched whose bark by chance
1	or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
1	after the tempest such applause was heard
1	as mammon ended and his sentence pleased 
1	advising peace for such another field
1	they dreaded worse than hell so much the fear
1	of thunder and the sword of michael
1	wrought still within them and no less desire
1	to found this nether empire which might rise 
1	by policy and long process of time 
1	in emulation opposite to heaven 
1	which when beelzebub perceived than whom 
1	satan except none higher sat with grave
1	aspect he rose and in his rising seemed
1	a pillar of state deep on his front engraven
1	deliberation sat and public care 
1	and princely counsel in his face yet shone 
1	majestic though in ruin sage he stood
1	with atlantean shoulders fit to bear
1	the weight of mightiest monarchies his look
1	drew audience and attention still as night
1	or summer s noontide air while thus he spake 
1	ethereal virtues or these titles now
1	must we renounce and changing style be called
1	princes of hell for so the popular vote
1	inclines here to continue and build up here
1	a growing empire doubtless while we dream 
1	and know not that the king of heaven hath doomed
1	this place our dungeon not our safe retreat
1	beyond his potent arm to live exempt
1	from heaven s high jurisdiction in new league
1	banded against his throne but to remain
1	in strictest bondage though thus far removed 
1	under th inevitable curb reserved
1	his captive multitude for he to be sure 
1	in height or depth still first and last will reign
1	sole king and of his kingdom lose no part
1	by our revolt but over hell extend
1	his empire and with iron sceptre rule
1	us here as with his golden those in heaven 
1	what sit we then projecting peace and war 
1	war hath determined us and foiled with loss
1	irreparable terms of peace yet none
1	vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given
1	to us enslaved but custody severe 
1	and stripes and arbitrary punishment
1	inflicted and what peace can we return 
1	but to our power hostility and hate 
1	untamed reluctance and revenge though slow 
1	yet ever plotting how the conqueror least
1	may reap his conquest and may least rejoice
1	in doing what we most in suffering feel 
1	nor will occasion want nor shall we need
1	with dangerous expedition to invade
1	heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege 
1	or ambush from the deep what if we find
1	some easier enterprise there is a place
1	 if ancient and prophetic fame in heaven
1	err not another world the happy seat
1	of some new race called man about this time
1	to be created like to us though less
1	in power and excellence but favoured more
1	of him who rules above so was his will
1	pronounced among the gods and by an oath
1	that shook heaven s whole circumference confirmed 
1	thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn
1	what creatures there inhabit of what mould
1	or substance how endued and what their power
1	and where their weakness how attempted best 
1	by force of subtlety though heaven be shut 
1	and heaven s high arbitrator sit secure
1	in his own strength this place may lie exposed 
1	the utmost border of his kingdom left
1	to their defence who hold it here perhaps 
1	some advantageous act may be achieved
1	by sudden onset either with hell fire
1	to waste his whole creation or possess
1	all as our own and drive as we were driven 
1	the puny habitants or if not drive 
1	seduce them to our party that their god
1	may prove their foe and with repenting hand
1	abolish his own works this would surpass
1	common revenge and interrupt his joy
1	in our confusion and our joy upraise
1	in his disturbance when his darling sons 
1	hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse
1	their frail original and faded bliss 
1	faded so soon advise if this be worth
1	attempting or to sit in darkness here
1	hatching vain empires thus beelzebub
1	pleaded his devilish counsel first devised
1	by satan and in part proposed for whence 
1	but from the author of all ill could spring
1	so deep a malice to confound the race
1	of mankind in one root and earth with hell
1	to mingle and involve done all to spite
1	the great creator but their spite still serves
1	his glory to augment the bold design
1	pleased highly those infernal states and joy
1	sparkled in all their eyes with full assent
1	they vote whereat his speech he thus renews 
1	 well have ye judged well ended long debate 
1	synod of gods and like to what ye are 
1	great things resolved which from the lowest deep
1	will once more lift us up in spite of fate 
1	nearer our ancient seat perhaps in view
1	of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms 
1	and opportune excursion we may chance
1	re enter heaven or else in some mild zone
1	dwell not unvisited of heaven s fair light 
1	secure and at the brightening orient beam
1	purge off this gloom the soft delicious air 
1	to heal the scar of these corrosive fires 
1	shall breathe her balm but first whom shall we send
1	in search of this new world whom shall we find
1	sufficient who shall tempt with wandering feet
1	the dark unbottomed infinite abyss 
1	and through the palpable obscure find out
1	his uncouth way or spread his airy flight 
1	upborne with indefatigable wings
1	over the vast abrupt ere he arrive
1	the happy isle what strength what art can then
1	suffice or what evasion bear him safe 
1	through the strict senteries and stations thick
1	of angels watching round here he had need
1	all circumspection and we now no less
1	choice in our suffrage for on whom we send
1	the weight of all and our last hope relies 
1	this said he sat and expectation held
1	his look suspense awaiting who appeared
1	to second or oppose or undertake
1	the perilous attempt but all sat mute 
1	pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each
1	in other s countenance read his own dismay 
1	astonished none among the choice and prime
1	of those heaven warring champions could be found
1	so hardy as to proffer or accept 
1	alone the dreadful voyage till at last 
1	satan whom now transcendent glory raised
1	above his fellows with monarchal pride
1	conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake 
1	with reason hath deep silence and demur
1	seized us though undismayed long is the way
1	and hard that out of hell leads up to light 
1	our prison strong this huge convex of fire 
1	outrageous to devour immures us round
1	ninefold and gates of burning adamant 
1	barred over us prohibit all egress 
1	these passed if any pass the void profound
1	of unessential night receives him next 
1	wide gaping and with utter loss of being
1	threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf 
1	if thence he scape into whatever world 
1	or unknown region what remains him less
1	than unknown dangers and as hard escape 
1	but i should ill become this throne o peers 
1	and this imperial sovereignty adorned
1	with splendour armed with power if aught proposed
1	and judged of public moment in the shape
1	of difficulty or danger could deter
1	me from attempting wherefore do i assume
1	these royalties and not refuse to reign 
1	refusing to accept as great a share
1	of hazard as of honour due alike
1	to him who reigns and so much to him due
1	of hazard more as he above the rest
1	high honoured sits go therefore mighty powers 
1	terror of heaven though fallen intend at home 
1	while here shall be our home what best may ease
1	the present misery and render hell
1	more tolerable if there be cure or charm
1	to respite or deceive or slack the pain
1	of this ill mansion intermit no watch
1	against a wakeful foe while i abroad
1	through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
1	deliverance for us all this enterprise
1	none shall partake with me thus saying rose
1	the monarch and prevented all reply 
1	prudent lest from his resolution raised 
1	others among the chief might offer now 
1	certain to be refused what erst they feared 
1	and so refused might in opinion stand
1	his rivals winning cheap the high repute
1	which he through hazard huge must earn but they
1	dreaded not more th adventure than his voice
1	forbidding and at once with him they rose 
1	their rising all at once was as the sound
1	of thunder heard remote towards him they bend
1	with awful reverence prone and as a god
1	extol him equal to the highest in heaven 
1	nor failed they to express how much they praised
1	that for the general safety he despised
1	his own for neither do the spirits damned
1	lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast
1	their specious deeds on earth which glory excites 
1	or close ambition varnished o er with zeal 
1	thus they their doubtful consultations dark
1	ended rejoicing in their matchless chief 
1	as when from mountain tops the dusky clouds
1	ascending while the north wind sleeps o erspread
1	heaven s cheerful face the louring element
1	scowls o er the darkened landscape snow or shower 
1	if chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet 
1	extend his evening beam the fields revive 
1	the birds their notes renew and bleating herds
1	attest their joy that hill and valley rings 
1	o shame to men devil with devil damned
1	firm concord holds men only disagree
1	of creatures rational though under hope
1	of heavenly grace and god proclaiming peace 
1	yet live in hatred enmity and strife
1	among themselves and levy cruel wars
1	wasting the earth each other to destroy 
1	as if which might induce us to accord 
1	man had not hellish foes enow besides 
1	that day and night for his destruction wait 
1	the stygian council thus dissolved and forth
1	in order came the grand infernal peers 
1	midst came their mighty paramount and seemed
1	alone th antagonist of heaven nor less
1	than hell s dread emperor with pomp supreme 
1	and god like imitated state him round
1	a globe of fiery seraphim enclosed
1	with bright emblazonry and horrent arms 
1	then of their session ended they bid cry
1	with trumpet s regal sound the great result 
1	toward the four winds four speedy cherubim
1	put to their mouths the sounding alchemy 
1	by herald s voice explained the hollow abyss
1	heard far and wide and all the host of hell
1	with deafening shout returned them loud acclaim 
1	thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised
1	by false presumptuous hope the ranged powers
1	disband and wandering each his several way
1	pursues as inclination or sad choice
1	leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find
1	truce to his restless thoughts and entertain
1	the irksome hours till his great chief return 
1	part on the plain or in the air sublime 
1	upon the wing or in swift race contend 
1	as at th olympian games or pythian fields 
1	part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal
1	with rapid wheels or fronted brigades form 
1	as when to warn proud cities war appears
1	waged in the troubled sky and armies rush
1	to battle in the clouds before each van
1	prick forth the airy knights and couch their spears 
1	till thickest legions close with feats of arms
1	from either end of heaven the welkin burns 
1	others with vast typhoean rage more fell 
1	rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air
1	in whirlwind hell scarce holds the wild uproar 
1	as when alcides from oechalia crowned
1	with conquest felt th envenomed robe and tore
1	through pain up by the roots thessalian pines 
1	and lichas from the top of oeta threw
1	into th euboic sea others more mild 
1	retreated in a silent valley sing
1	with notes angelical to many a harp
1	their own heroic deeds and hapless fall
1	by doom of battle and complain that fate
1	free virtue should enthrall to force or chance 
1	their song was partial but the harmony
1	 what could it less when spirits immortal sing 
1	suspended hell and took with ravishment
1	the thronging audience in discourse more sweet
1	 for eloquence the soul song charms the sense 
1	others apart sat on a hill retired 
1	in thoughts more elevate and reasoned high
1	fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute 
1	and found no end in wandering mazes lost 
1	of good and evil much they argued then 
1	of happiness and final misery 
1	passion and apathy and glory and shame 
1	vain wisdom all and false philosophy 
1	yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm
1	pain for a while or anguish and excite
1	fallacious hope or arm th obdured breast
1	with stubborn patience as with triple steel 
1	another part in squadrons and gross bands 
1	on bold adventure to discover wide
1	that dismal world if any clime perhaps
1	might yield them easier habitation bend
1	four ways their flying march along the banks
1	of four infernal rivers that disgorge
1	into the burning lake their baleful streams 
1	abhorred styx the flood of deadly hate 
1	sad acheron of sorrow black and deep 
1	cocytus named of lamentation loud
1	heard on the rueful stream fierce phlegeton 
1	whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage 
1	far off from these a slow and silent stream 
1	lethe the river of oblivion rolls
1	her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks
1	forthwith his former state and being forgets 
1	forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain 
1	beyond this flood a frozen continent
1	lies dark and wild beat with perpetual storms
1	of whirlwind and dire hail which on firm land
1	thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems
1	of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice 
1	a gulf profound as that serbonian bog
1	betwixt damiata and mount casius old 
1	where armies whole have sunk the parching air
1	burns frore and cold performs th effect of fire 
1	thither by harpy footed furies haled 
1	at certain revolutions all the damned
1	are brought and feel by turns the bitter change
1	of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce 
1	from beds of raging fire to starve in ice
1	their soft ethereal warmth and there to pine
1	immovable infixed and frozen round
1	periods of time thence hurried back to fire 
1	they ferry over this lethean sound
1	both to and fro their sorrow to augment 
1	and wish and struggle as they pass to reach
1	the tempting stream with one small drop to lose
1	in sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe 
1	all in one moment and so near the brink 
1	but fate withstands and to oppose th attempt 
1	medusa with gorgonian terror guards
1	the ford and of itself the water flies
1	all taste of living wight as once it fled
1	the lip of tantalus thus roving on
1	in confused march forlorn th adventurous bands 
1	with shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast 
1	viewed first their lamentable lot and found
1	no rest through many a dark and dreary vale
1	they passed and many a region dolorous 
1	o er many a frozen many a fiery alp 
1	rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death 
1	a universe of death which god by curse
1	created evil for evil only good 
1	where all life dies death lives and nature breeds 
1	perverse all monstrous all prodigious things 
1	obominable inutterable and worse
1	than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived 
1	gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire 
1	satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design 
1	puts on swift wings and toward the gates of hell
1	explores his solitary flight sometimes
1	he scours the right hand coast sometimes the left 
1	now shaves with level wing the deep then soars
1	up to the fiery concave towering high 
1	as when far off at sea a fleet descried
1	hangs in the clouds by equinoctial winds
1	close sailing from bengala or the isles
1	of ternate and tidore whence merchants bring
1	their spicy drugs they on the trading flood 
1	through the wide ethiopian to the cape 
1	ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed
1	far off the flying fiend at last appear
1	hell bounds high reaching to the horrid roof 
1	and thrice threefold the gates three folds were brass 
1	three iron three of adamantine rock 
1	impenetrable impaled with circling fire 
1	yet unconsumed before the gates there sat
1	on either side a formidable shape 
1	the one seemed woman to the waist and fair 
1	but ended foul in many a scaly fold 
1	voluminous and vast a serpent armed
1	with mortal sting about her middle round
1	a cry of hell hounds never ceasing barked
1	with wide cerberean mouths full loud and rung
1	a hideous peal yet when they list would creep 
1	if aught disturbed their noise into her womb 
1	and kennel there yet there still barked and howled
1	within unseen far less abhorred than these
1	vexed scylla bathing in the sea that parts
1	calabria from the hoarse trinacrian shore 
1	nor uglier follow the night hag when called
1	in secret riding through the air she comes 
1	lured with the smell of infant blood to dance
1	with lapland witches while the labouring moon
1	eclipses at their charms the other shape 
1	if shape it might be called that shape had none
1	distinguishable in member joint or limb 
1	or substance might be called that shadow seemed 
1	for each seemed either black it stood as night 
1	fierce as ten furies terrible as hell 
1	and shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head
1	the likeness of a kingly crown had on 
1	satan was now at hand and from his seat
1	the monster moving onward came as fast
1	with horrid strides hell trembled as he strode 
1	th undaunted fiend what this might be admired 
1	admired not feared god and his son except 
1	created thing naught valued he nor shunned 
1	and with disdainful look thus first began 
1	 whence and what art thou execrable shape 
1	that dar st though grim and terrible advance
1	thy miscreated front athwart my way
1	to yonder gates through them i mean to pass 
1	that be assured without leave asked of thee 
1	retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof 
1	hell born not to contend with spirits of heaven 
1	to whom the goblin full of wrath replied 
1	 art thou that traitor angel art thou he 
1	who first broke peace in heaven and faith till then
1	unbroken and in proud rebellious arms
1	drew after him the third part of heaven s sons 
1	conjured against the highest for which both thou
1	and they outcast from god are here condemned
1	to waste eternal days in woe and pain 
1	and reckon st thou thyself with spirits of heaven
1	hell doomed and breath st defiance here and scorn 
1	where i reign king and to enrage thee more 
1	thy king and lord back to thy punishment 
1	false fugitive and to thy speed add wings 
1	lest with a whip of scorpions i pursue
1	thy lingering or with one stroke of this dart
1	strange horror seize thee and pangs unfelt before 
1	so spake the grisly terror and in shape 
1	so speaking and so threatening grew tenfold 
1	more dreadful and deform on th other side 
1	incensed with indignation satan stood
1	unterrified and like a comet burned 
1	that fires the length of ophiuchus huge
1	in th arctic sky and from his horrid hair
1	shakes pestilence and war each at the head
1	levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands
1	no second stroke intend and such a frown
1	each cast at th other as when two black clouds 
1	with heaven s artillery fraught came rattling on
1	over the caspian then stand front to front
1	hovering a space till winds the signal blow
1	to join their dark encounter in mid air 
1	so frowned the mighty combatants that hell
1	grew darker at their frown so matched they stood 
1	for never but once more was wither like
1	to meet so great a foe and now great deeds
1	had been achieved whereof all hell had rung 
1	had not the snaky sorceress that sat
1	fast by hell gate and kept the fatal key 
1	risen and with hideous outcry rushed between 
1	 o father what intends thy hand she cried 
1	 against thy only son what fury o son 
1	possesses thee to bend that mortal dart
1	against thy father s head and know st for whom 
1	for him who sits above and laughs the while
1	at thee ordained his drudge to execute
1	whate er his wrath which he calls justice bids 
1	his wrath which one day will destroy ye both 
1	she spake and at her words the hellish pest
1	forbore then these to her satan returned 
1	 so strange thy outcry and thy words so strange
1	thou interposest that my sudden hand 
1	prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
1	what it intends till first i know of thee
1	what thing thou art thus double formed and why 
1	in this infernal vale first met thou call st
1	me father and that phantasm call st my son 
1	i know thee not nor ever saw till now
1	sight more detestable than him and thee 
1	t whom thus the portress of hell gate replied 
1	 hast thou forgot me then and do i seem
1	now in thine eye so foul once deemed so fair
1	in heaven when at th assembly and in sight
1	of all the seraphim with thee combined
1	in bold conspiracy against heaven s king 
1	all on a sudden miserable pain
1	surprised thee dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
1	in darkness while thy head flames thick and fast
1	threw forth till on the left side opening wide 
1	likest to thee in shape and countenance bright 
1	then shining heavenly fair a goddess armed 
1	out of thy head i sprung amazement seized
1	all th host of heaven back they recoiled afraid
1	at first and called me sin and for a sign
1	portentous held me but familiar grown 
1	i pleased and with attractive graces won
1	the most averse thee chiefly who full oft
1	thyself in me thy perfect image viewing 
1	becam st enamoured and such joy thou took st
1	with me in secret that my womb conceived
1	a growing burden meanwhile war arose 
1	and fields were fought in heaven wherein remained
1	 for what could else to our almighty foe
1	clear victory to our part loss and rout
1	through all the empyrean down they fell 
1	driven headlong from the pitch of heaven down
1	into this deep and in the general fall
1	i also at which time this powerful key
1	into my hands was given with charge to keep
1	these gates for ever shut which none can pass
1	without my opening pensive here i sat
1	alone but long i sat not till my womb 
1	pregnant by thee and now excessive grown 
1	prodigious motion felt and rueful throes 
1	at last this odious offspring whom thou seest 
1	thine own begotten breaking violent way 
1	tore through my entrails that with fear and pain
1	distorted all my nether shape thus grew
1	transformed but he my inbred enemy
1	forth issued brandishing his fatal dart 
1	made to destroy i fled and cried out death 
1	hell trembled at the hideous name and sighed
1	from all her caves and back resounded death 
1	i fled but he pursued though more it seems 
1	inflamed with lust than rage and swifter far 
1	me overtook his mother all dismayed 
1	and in embraces forcible and foul
1	engendering with me of that rape begot
1	these yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry
1	surround me as thou saw st hourly conceived
1	and hourly born with sorrow infinite
1	to me for when they list into the womb
1	that bred them they return and howl and gnaw
1	my bowels their repast then bursting forth
1	afresh with conscious terrors vex me round 
1	that rest or intermission none i find 
1	before mine eyes in opposition sits
1	grim death my son and foe who set them on 
1	and me his parent would full soon devour
1	for want of other prey but that he knows
1	his end with mine involved and knows that i
1	should prove a bitter morsel and his bane 
1	whenever that shall be so fate pronounced 
1	but thou o father i forewarn thee shun
1	his deadly arrow neither vainly hope
1	to be invulnerable in those bright arms 
1	through tempered heavenly for that mortal dint 
1	save he who reigns above none can resist 
1	she finished and the subtle fiend his lore
1	soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth 
1	 dear daughter since thou claim st me for thy sire 
1	and my fair son here show st me the dear pledge
1	of dalliance had with thee in heaven and joys
1	then sweet now sad to mention through dire change
1	befallen us unforeseen unthought of know 
1	i come no enemy but to set free
1	from out this dark and dismal house of pain
1	both him and thee and all the heavenly host
1	of spirits that in our just pretences armed 
1	fell with us from on high from them i go
1	this uncouth errand sole and one for all
1	myself expose with lonely steps to tread
1	th unfounded deep and through the void immense
1	to search with wandering quest a place foretold
1	should be and by concurring signs ere now
1	created vast and round a place of bliss
1	in the purlieus of heaven and therein placed
1	a race of upstart creatures to supply
1	perhaps our vacant room though more removed 
1	lest heaven surcharged with potent multitude 
1	might hap to move new broils be this or aught
1	than this more secret now designed i haste
1	to know and this once known shall soon return 
1	and bring ye to the place where thou and death
1	shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen
1	wing silently the buxom air embalmed
1	with odours there ye shall be fed and filled
1	immeasurably all things shall be your prey 
1	he ceased for both seemed highly pleased and death
1	grinned horrible a ghastly smile to hear
1	his famine should be filled and blessed his maw
1	destined to that good hour no less rejoiced
1	his mother bad and thus bespake her sire 
1	 the key of this infernal pit by due
1	and by command of heaven s all powerful king 
1	i keep by him forbidden to unlock
1	these adamantine gates against all force
1	death ready stands to interpose his dart 
1	fearless to be o ermatched by living might 
1	but what owe i to his commands above 
1	who hates me and hath hither thrust me down
1	into this gloom of tartarus profound 
1	to sit in hateful office here confined 
1	inhabitant of heaven and heavenly born 
1	here in perpetual agony and pain 
1	with terrors and with clamours compassed round
1	of mine own brood that on my bowels feed 
1	thou art my father thou my author thou
1	my being gav st me whom should i obey
1	but thee whom follow thou wilt bring me soon
1	to that new world of light and bliss among
1	the gods who live at ease where i shall reign
1	at thy right hand voluptuous as beseems
1	thy daughter and thy darling without end 
1	thus saying from her side the fatal key 
1	sad instrument of all our woe she took 
1	and towards the gate rolling her bestial train 
1	forthwith the huge portcullis high up drew 
1	which but herself not all the stygian powers
1	could once have moved then in the key hole turns
1	th intricate wards and every bolt and bar
1	of massy iron or solid rock with ease
1	unfastens on a sudden open fly 
1	with impetuous recoil and jarring sound 
1	th infernal doors and on their hinges grate
1	harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook
1	of erebus she opened but to shut
1	excelled her power the gates wide open stood 
1	that with extended wings a bannered host 
1	under spread ensigns marching might pass through
1	with horse and chariots ranked in loose array 
1	so wide they stood and like a furnace mouth
1	cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame 
1	before their eyes in sudden view appear
1	the secrets of the hoary deep a dark
1	illimitable ocean without bound 
1	without dimension where length breadth and height 
1	and time and place are lost where eldest night
1	and chaos ancestors of nature hold
1	eternal anarchy amidst the noise
1	of endless wars and by confusion stand 
1	for hot cold moist and dry four champions fierce 
1	strive here for mastery and to battle bring
1	their embryon atoms they around the flag
1	of each his faction in their several clans 
1	light armed or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow 
1	swarm populous unnumbered as the sands
1	of barca or cyrene s torrid soil 
1	levied to side with warring winds and poise
1	their lighter wings to whom these most adhere
1	he rules a moment chaos umpire sits 
1	and by decision more embroils the fray
1	by which he reigns next him high arbiter 
1	chance governs all into this wild abyss 
1	the womb of nature and perhaps her grave 
1	of neither sea nor shore nor air nor fire 
1	but all these in their pregnant causes mixed
1	confusedly and which thus must ever fight 
1	unless th almighty maker them ordain
1	his dark materials to create more worlds 
1	into this wild abyss the wary fiend
1	stood on the brink of hell and looked a while 
1	pondering his voyage for no narrow frith
1	he had to cross nor was his ear less pealed
1	with noises loud and ruinous to compare
1	great things with small than when bellona storms
1	with all her battering engines bent to rase
1	some capital city or less than if this frame
1	of heaven were falling and these elements
1	in mutiny had from her axle torn
1	the steadfast earth at last his sail broad vans
1	he spread for flight and in the surging smoke
1	uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league 
1	as in a cloudy chair ascending rides
1	audacious but that seat soon failing meets
1	a vast vacuity all unawares 
1	fluttering his pennons vain plumb down he drops
1	ten thousand fathom deep and to this hour
1	down had been falling had not by ill chance 
1	the strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud 
1	instinct with fire and nitre hurried him
1	as many miles aloft that fury stayed 
1	quenched in a boggy syrtis neither sea 
1	nor good dry land nigh foundered on he fares 
1	treading the crude consistence half on foot 
1	half flying behoves him now both oar and sail 
1	as when a gryphon through the wilderness
1	with winged course o er hill or moory dale 
1	pursues the arimaspian who by stealth
1	had from his wakeful custody purloined
1	the guarded gold so eagerly the fiend
1	o er bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare 
1	with head hands wings or feet pursues his way 
1	and swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies 
1	at length a universal hubbub wild
1	of stunning sounds and voices all confused 
1	borne through the hollow dark assaults his ear
1	with loudest vehemence thither he plies
1	undaunted to meet there whatever power
1	or spirit of the nethermost abyss
1	might in that noise reside of whom to ask
1	which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
1	bordering on light when straight behold the throne
1	of chaos and his dark pavilion spread
1	wide on the wasteful deep with him enthroned
1	sat sable vested night eldest of things 
1	the consort of his reign and by them stood
1	orcus and ades and the dreaded name
1	of demogorgon rumour next and chance 
1	and tumult and confusion all embroiled 
1	and discord with a thousand various mouths 
1	t whom satan turning boldly thus ye powers
1	and spirits of this nethermost abyss 
1	chaos and ancient night i come no spy
1	with purpose to explore or to disturb
1	the secrets of your realm but by constraint
1	wandering this darksome desert as my way
1	lies through your spacious empire up to light 
1	alone and without guide half lost i seek 
1	what readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
1	confine with heaven or if some other place 
1	from your dominion won th ethereal king
1	possesses lately thither to arrive
1	i travel this profound direct my course 
1	directed no mean recompense it brings
1	to your behoof if i that region lost 
1	all usurpation thence expelled reduce
1	to her original darkness and your sway
1	 which is my present journey and once more
1	erect the standard there of ancient night 
1	yours be th advantage all mine the revenge 
1	thus satan and him thus the anarch old 
1	with faltering speech and visage incomposed 
1	answered i know thee stranger who thou art 
1	that mighty leading angel who of late
1	made head against heaven s king though overthrown 
1	i saw and heard for such a numerous host
1	fled not in silence through the frighted deep 
1	with ruin upon ruin rout on rout 
1	confusion worse confounded and heaven gates
1	poured out by millions her victorious bands 
1	pursuing i upon my frontiers here
1	keep residence if all i can will serve
1	that little which is left so to defend 
1	encroached on still through our intestine broils
1	weakening the sceptre of old night first hell 
1	your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath 
1	now lately heaven and earth another world
1	hung o er my realm linked in a golden chain
1	to that side heaven from whence your legions fell 
1	if that way be your walk you have not far 
1	so much the nearer danger go and speed 
1	havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain 
1	he ceased and satan stayed not to reply 
1	but glad that now his sea should find a shore 
1	with fresh alacrity and force renewed
1	springs upward like a pyramid of fire 
1	into the wild expanse and through the shock
1	of fighting elements on all sides round
1	environed wins his way harder beset
1	and more endangered than when argo passed
1	through bosporus betwixt the justling rocks 
1	or when ulysses on the larboard shunned
1	charybdis and by th other whirlpool steered 
1	so he with difficulty and labour hard
1	moved on with difficulty and labour he 
1	but he once passed soon after when man fell 
1	strange alteration sin and death amain 
1	following his track such was the will of heaven 
1	paved after him a broad and beaten way
1	over the dark abyss whose boiling gulf
1	tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length 
1	from hell continued reaching th utmost orb
1	of this frail world by which the spirits perverse
1	with easy intercourse pass to and fro
1	to tempt or punish mortals except whom
1	god and good angels guard by special grace 
1	but now at last the sacred influence
1	of light appears and from the walls of heaven
1	shoots far into the bosom of dim night
1	a glimmering dawn here nature first begins
1	her farthest verge and chaos to retire 
1	as from her outmost works a broken foe 
1	with tumult less and with less hostile din 
1	that satan with less toil and now with ease 
1	wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light 
1	and like a weather beaten vessel holds
1	gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn 
1	or in the emptier waste resembling air 
1	weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold
1	far off th empyreal heaven extended wide
1	in circuit undetermined square or round 
1	with opal towers and battlements adorned
1	of living sapphire once his native seat 
1	and fast by hanging in a golden chain 
1	this pendent world in bigness as a star
1	of smallest magnitude close by the moon 
1	thither full fraught with mischievous revenge 
1	accursed and in a cursed hour he hies 
1	hail holy light offspring of heaven firstborn 
1	or of the eternal coeternal beam
1	may i express thee unblam d since god is light 
1	and never but in unapproached light
1	dwelt from eternity dwelt then in thee
1	bright effluence of bright essence increate 
1	or hear st thou rather pure ethereal stream 
1	whose fountain who shall tell before the sun 
1	before the heavens thou wert and at the voice
1	of god as with a mantle didst invest
1	the rising world of waters dark and deep 
1	won from the void and formless infinite 
1	thee i re visit now with bolder wing 
1	escap d the stygian pool though long detain d
1	in that obscure sojourn while in my flight
1	through utter and through middle darkness borne 
1	with other notes than to the orphean lyre
1	i sung of chaos and eternal night 
1	taught by the heavenly muse to venture down
1	the dark descent and up to re ascend 
1	though hard and rare thee i revisit safe 
1	and feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou
1	revisit st not these eyes that roll in vain
1	to find thy piercing ray and find no dawn 
1	so thick a drop serene hath quench d their orbs 
1	or dim suffusion veil d yet not the more
1	cease i to wander where the muses haunt 
1	clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill 
1	smit with the love of sacred song but chief
1	thee sion and the flowery brooks beneath 
1	that wash thy hallow d feet and warbling flow 
1	nightly i visit nor sometimes forget
1	so were i equall d with them in renown 
1	thy sovran command that man should find grace 
1	blind thamyris and blind maeonides 
1	and tiresias and phineus prophets old 
1	then feed on thoughts that voluntary move
1	harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird
1	sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid
1	tunes her nocturnal note thus with the year
1	seasons return but not to me returns
1	day or the sweet approach of even or morn 
1	or sight of vernal bloom or summer s rose 
1	or flocks or herds or human face divine 
1	but cloud instead and ever during dark
1	surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men
1	cut off and for the book of knowledge fair
1	presented with a universal blank
1	of nature s works to me expung d and ras d 
1	and wisdom at one entrance quite shut out 
1	so much the rather thou celestial light 
1	shine inward and the mind through all her powers
1	irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence
1	purge and disperse that i may see and tell
1	of things invisible to mortal sight 
1	now had the almighty father from above 
1	from the pure empyrean where he sits
1	high thron d above all highth bent down his eye
1	his own works and their works at once to view 
1	stood thick as stars and from his sight receiv d
1	beatitude past utterance on his right

1	our two first parents yet the only two
1	of mankind in the happy garden plac d
1	reaping immortal fruits of joy and love 
1	uninterrupted joy unrivall d love 
1	in blissful solitude he then survey d
1	hell and the gulf between and satan there
1	coasting the wall of heaven on this side night
1	in the dun air sublime and ready now
1	to stoop with wearied wings and willing feet 
1	on the bare outside of this world that seem d
1	firm land imbosom d without firmament 
1	uncertain which in ocean or in air 
1	him god beholding from his prospect high 
1	wherein past present future he beholds

1	transports our adversary whom no bounds
1	prescrib d no bars of hell nor all the chains
1	heap d on him there nor yet the main abyss
1	wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems
1	on desperate revenge that shall redound
1	upon his own rebellious head and now 
1	through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
1	not far off heaven in the precincts of light 
1	directly towards the new created world 
1	and man there plac d with purpose to assay
1	if him by force he can destroy or worse 
1	by some false guile pervert and shall pervert 
1	for man will hearken to his glozing lies 
1	and easily transgress the sole command 
1	sole pledge of his obedience so will fall
1	he and his faithless progeny whose fault 
1	whose but his own ingrate he had of me
1	all he could have i made him just and right 
1	sufficient to have stood though free to fall 
1	such i created all the ethereal powers
1	and spirits both them who stood and them who fail d 
1	freely they stood who stood and fell who fell 
1	not free what proof could they have given sincere
1	of true allegiance constant faith or love 
1	where only what they needs must do appear d 
1	not what they would what praise could they receive 
1	what pleasure i from such obedience paid 
1	when will and reason reason also is choice 
1	useless and vain of freedom both despoil d 
1	made passive both had serv d necessity 
1	not me they therefore as to right belong d 
1	so were created nor can justly accuse
1	their maker or their making or their fate 
1	as if predestination over rul d
1	their will dispos d by absolute decree
1	or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
1	their own revolt not i if i foreknew 
1	foreknowledge had no influence on their fault 
1	which had no less proved certain unforeknown 
1	so without least impulse or shadow of fate 
1	or aught by me immutably foreseen 
1	they trespass authors to themselves in all
1	both what they judge and what they choose for so
1	i form d them free and free they must remain 
1	till they enthrall themselves i else must change

1	on even ground against his mortal foe 
1	by me upheld that he may know how frail

1	to pray repent and bring obedience due 
1	to prayer repentance and obedience due 
1	though but endeavour d with sincere intent 
1	mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut

1	then with the multitude of my redeemed 
1	shall enter heaven long absent and return 
1	father to see thy face wherein no cloud
1	of anger shall remain but peace assured
1	and reconcilement wrath shall be no more
1	thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire 
1	his words here ended but his meek aspect
1	silent yet spake and breathed immortal love
1	to mortal men above which only shone
1	filial obedience as a sacrifice
1	glad to be offered he attends the will
1	of his great father admiration seized
1	all heaven what this might mean and whither tend 
1	wondering but soon th almighty thus replied 
1	o thou in heaven and earth the only peace
1	found out for mankind under wrath o thou
1	my sole complacence well thou know st how dear
1	to me are all my works nor man the least 
1	though last created that for him i spare
1	thee from my bosom and right hand to save 
1	by losing thee a while the whole race lost 
1	thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem 
1	their nature also to thy nature join 
1	and be thyself man among men on earth 
1	made flesh when time shall be of virgin seed 
1	by wondrous birth be thou in adam s room
1	the head of all mankind though adam s son 
1	as in him perish all men so in thee 
1	as from a second root shall be restored
1	as many as are restored without thee none 
1	his crime makes guilty all his sons thy merit 
1	imputed shall absolve them who renounce
1	their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds 
1	and live in thee transplanted and from thee
1	receive new life so man as is most just 
1	shall satisfy for man be judged and die 
1	and dying rise and rising with him raise
1	his brethren ransomed with his own dear life 
1	so heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate 
1	giving to death and dying to redeem 
1	so dearly to redeem what hellish hate
1	so easily destroyed and still destroys
1	in those who when they may accept not grace 
1	nor shalt thou by descending to assume
1	man s nature lessen or degrade thine own 
1	because thou hast though throned in highest bliss
1	equal to god and equally enjoying
1	god like fruition quitted all to save
1	a world from utter loss and hast been found
1	by merit more than birthright son of god 
1	found worthiest to be so by being good 
1	far more than great or high because in thee
1	love hath abounded more than glory abounds 
1	therefore thy humiliation shall exalt
1	with thee thy manhood also to this throne 
1	here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign
1	both god and man son both of god and man 
1	anointed universal king all power
1	i give thee reign for ever and assume
1	thy merits under thee as head supreme 
1	thrones princedoms powers dominions i reduce 
1	all knees to thee shall bow of them that bide
1	in heaven or earth or under earth in hell 
1	when thou attended gloriously from heaven 
1	shalt in the sky appear and from thee send
1	the summoning arch angels to proclaim
1	thy dread tribunal forthwith from all winds 
1	the living and forthwith the cited dead
1	of all past ages to the general doom
1	shall hasten such a peal shall rouse their sleep 
1	then all thy saints assembled thou shalt judge
1	bad men and angels they arraigned shall sink
1	beneath thy sentence hell her numbers full 
1	thenceforth shall be for ever shut mean while
1	the world shall burn and from her ashes spring
1	new heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell 
1	and after all their tribulations long 
1	see golden days fruitful of golden deeds 
1	with joy and peace triumphing and fair truth 
1	then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by 
1	for regal scepter then no more shall need 
1	god shall be all in all but all ye gods 
1	adore him who to compass all this dies 
1	adore the son and honour him as me 
1	no sooner had the almighty ceased but all
1	the multitude of angels with a shout
1	loud as from numbers without number sweet
1	as from blest voices uttering joy heaven rung
1	with jubilee and loud hosannas filled
1	the eternal regions lowly reverent
1	towards either throne they bow and to the ground
1	with solemn adoration down they cast
1	their crowns inwove with amarant and gold 
1	immortal amarant a flower which once
1	in paradise fast by the tree of life 
1	began to bloom but soon for man s offence
1	to heaven removed where first it grew there grows 
1	and flowers aloft shading the fount of life 
1	and where the river of bliss through midst of heaven
1	rolls o er elysian flowers her amber stream 
1	with these that never fade the spirits elect
1	bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams 
1	now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright
1	pavement that like a sea of jasper shone 
1	impurpled with celestial roses smiled 
1	then crowned again their golden harps they took 
1	harps ever tuned that glittering by their side
1	like quivers hung and with preamble sweet
1	of charming symphony they introduce
1	their sacred song and waken raptures high 
1	no voice exempt no voice but well could join
1	melodious part such concord is in heaven 
1	thee father first they sung omnipotent 
1	eternal king the author of all being 
1	fountain of light thyself invisible
1	amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit st
1	throned inaccessible but when thou shadest
1	the full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud
1	drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine 
1	dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear 
1	yet dazzle heaven that brightest seraphim
1	approach not but with both wings veil their eyes 
1	thee next they sang of all creation first 
1	in whose conspicuous countenance without cloud
1	made visible the almighty father shines 
1	whom else no creature can behold on thee
1	impressed the effulgence of his glory abides 
1	transfused on thee his ample spirit rests 
1	he heaven of heavens and all the powers therein
1	by thee created and by thee threw down
1	the aspiring dominations thou that day
1	thy father s dreadful thunder didst not spare 
1	nor stop thy flaming chariot wheels that shook
1	heaven s everlasting frame while o er the necks
1	thou drovest of warring angels disarrayed 
1	back from pursuit thy powers with loud acclaim
1	thee only extolled son of thy father s might 
1	to execute fierce vengeance on his foes 
1	not so on man him through their malice fallen 
1	father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom
1	so strictly but much more to pity incline 
1	no sooner did thy dear and only son
1	perceive thee purposed not to doom frail man
1	so strictly but much more to pity inclined 
1	he to appease thy wrath and end the strife
1	of mercy and justice in thy face discerned 
1	regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
1	second to thee offered himself to die
1	for man s offence o unexampled love 
1	love no where to be found less than divine 
1	hail son of god saviour of men thy name
1	shall be the copious matter of my song
1	henceforth and never shall my heart thy praise
1	forget nor from thy father s praise disjoin 
1	thus they in heaven above the starry sphere 
1	their happy hours in joy and hymning spent 
1	mean while upon the firm opacous globe
1	of this round world whose first convex divides
1	the luminous inferiour orbs enclosed
1	from chaos and the inroad of darkness old 
1	satan alighted walks a globe far off
1	it seemed now seems a boundless continent
1	dark waste and wild under the frown of night
1	starless exposed and ever threatening storms
1	of chaos blustering round inclement sky 
1	save on that side which from the wall of heaven 
1	though distant far some small reflection gains
1	of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud 
1	here walked the fiend at large in spacious field 
1	as when a vultur on imaus bred 
1	whose snowy ridge the roving tartar bounds 
1	dislodging from a region scarce of prey
1	to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids 
1	on hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
1	of ganges or hydaspes indian streams 
1	but in his way lights on the barren plains
1	of sericana where chineses drive
1	with sails and wind their cany waggons light 
1	so on this windy sea of land the fiend
1	walked up and down alone bent on his prey 
1	alone for other creature in this place 
1	living or lifeless to be found was none 
1	none yet but store hereafter from the earth
1	up hither like aereal vapours flew
1	of all things transitory and vain when sin
1	with vanity had filled the works of men 
1	both all things vain and all who in vain things
1	built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame 
1	or happiness in this or the other life 
1	all who have their reward on earth the fruits
1	of painful superstition and blind zeal 
1	nought seeking but the praise of men here find
1	fit retribution empty as their deeds 
1	all the unaccomplished works of nature s hand 
1	abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed 
1	dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain 
1	till final dissolution wander here 
1	not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed 
1	those argent fields more likely habitants 
1	translated saints or middle spirits hold
1	betwixt the angelical and human kind 
1	hither of ill joined sons and daughters born
1	first from the ancient world those giants came
1	with many a vain exploit though then renowned 
1	the builders next of babel on the plain
1	of sennaar and still with vain design 
1	new babels had they wherewithal would build 
1	others came single he who to be deemed
1	a god leaped fondly into aetna flames 
1	empedocles and he who to enjoy
1	plato s elysium leaped into the sea 
1	cleombrotus and many more too long 
1	white black and gray with all their trumpery 
1	here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek
1	in golgotha him dead who lives in heaven 
1	and they who to be sure of paradise 
1	dying put on the weeds of dominick 
1	or in franciscan think to pass disguised 
1	they pass the planets seven and pass the fixed 
1	and that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
1	the trepidation talked and that first moved 
1	and now saint peter at heaven s wicket seems
1	to wait them with his keys and now at foot
1	of heaven s ascent they lift their feet when lo
1	a violent cross wind from either coast
1	blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
1	into the devious air then might ye see
1	cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost
1	and fluttered into rags then reliques beads 
1	indulgences dispenses pardons bulls 
1	the sport of winds all these upwhirled aloft 
1	fly o er the backside of the world far off
1	into a limbo large and broad since called
1	the paradise of fools to few unknown
1	long after now unpeopled and untrod 
1	all this dark globe the fiend found as he passed 
1	and long he wandered till at last a gleam
1	of dawning light turned thither ward in haste
1	his travelled steps far distant he descries
1	ascending by degrees magnificent
1	up to the wall of heaven a structure high 
1	at top whereof but far more rich appeared
1	the work as of a kingly palace gate 
1	with frontispiece of diamond and gold
1	embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
1	the portal shone inimitable on earth
1	by model or by shading pencil drawn 
1	these stairs were such as whereon jacob saw
1	angels ascending and descending bands
1	of guardians bright when he from esau fled
1	to padan aram in the field of luz
1	dreaming by night under the open sky
1	and waking cried this is the gate of heaven 
1	each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
1	there always but drawn up to heaven sometimes
1	viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed
1	of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
1	who after came from earth failing arrived
1	wafted by angels or flew o er the lake
1	rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds 
1	the stairs were then let down whether to dare
1	the fiend by easy ascent or aggravate
1	his sad exclusion from the doors of bliss 
1	direct against which opened from beneath 
1	just o er the blissful seat of paradise 
1	a passage down to the earth a passage wide 
1	wider by far than that of after times
1	over mount sion and though that were large 
1	over the promised land to god so dear 
1	by which to visit oft those happy tribes 
1	on high behests his angels to and fro
1	passed frequent and his eye with choice regard
1	from paneas the fount of jordan s flood 
1	to beersaba where the holy land
1	so wide the opening seemed where bounds were set
1	to darkness such as bound the ocean wave 
1	satan from hence now on the lower stair 
1	that scaled by steps of gold to heaven gate 
1	looks down with wonder at the sudden view
1	of all this world at once as when a scout 
1	through dark and desert ways with peril gone
1	all night at last by break of cheerful dawn
1	obtains the brow of some high climbing hill 
1	which to his eye discovers unaware
1	the goodly prospect of some foreign land
1	first seen or some renowned metropolis
1	with glistering spires and pinnacles adorned 
1	which now the rising sun gilds with his beams 
1	such wonder seised though after heaven seen 
1	the spirit malign but much more envy seised 
1	at sight of all this world beheld so fair 
1	round he surveys and well might where he stood
1	so high above the circling canopy
1	of night s extended shade from eastern point
1	of libra to the fleecy star that bears
1	andromeda far off atlantick seas
1	beyond the horizon then from pole to pole
1	he views in breadth and without longer pause
1	down right into the world s first region throws
1	his flight precipitant and winds with ease
1	through the pure marble air his oblique way
1	amongst innumerable stars that shone
1	stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds 
1	or other worlds they seemed or happy isles 
1	like those hesperian gardens famed of old 
1	fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales 
1	thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
1	he staid not to inquire above them all
1	the golden sun in splendour likest heaven 
1	allured his eye thither his course he bends
1	through the calm firmament but up or down 
1	by center or eccentrick hard to tell 
1	or longitude where the great luminary
1	aloof the vulgar constellations thick 
1	that from his lordly eye keep distance due 
1	dispenses light from far they as they move
1	their starry dance in numbers that compute
1	days months and years towards his all cheering lamp
1	turn swift their various motions or are turned
1	by his magnetick beam that gently warms
1	the universe and to each inward part
1	with gentle penetration though unseen 
1	shoots invisible virtue even to the deep 
1	so wonderously was set his station bright 
1	there lands the fiend a spot like which perhaps
1	astronomer in the sun s lucent orb
1	through his glazed optick tube yet never saw 
1	the place he found beyond expression bright 
1	compared with aught on earth metal or stone 
1	not all parts like but all alike informed
1	with radiant light as glowing iron with fire 
1	if metal part seemed gold part silver clear 
1	if stone carbuncle most or chrysolite 
1	ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone
1	in aaron s breast plate and a stone besides
1	imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen 
1	that stone or like to that which here below
1	philosophers in vain so long have sought 
1	in vain though by their powerful art they bind
1	volatile hermes and call up unbound
1	in various shapes old proteus from the sea 
1	drained through a limbeck to his native form 
1	what wonder then if fields and regions here
1	breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run
1	potable gold when with one virtuous touch
1	the arch chemick sun so far from us remote 
1	produces with terrestrial humour mixed 
1	here in the dark so many precious things
1	of colour glorious and effect so rare 
1	here matter new to gaze the devil met
1	undazzled far and wide his eye commands 
1	for sight no obstacle found here nor shade 
1	but all sun shine as when his beams at noon
1	culminate from the equator as they now
1	shot upward still direct whence no way round
1	shadow from body opaque can fall and the air 
1	no where so clear sharpened his visual ray
1	to objects distant far whereby he soon
1	saw within ken a glorious angel stand 
1	the same whom john saw also in the sun 
1	his back was turned but not his brightness hid 
1	of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
1	circled his head nor less his locks behind
1	illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
1	lay waving round on some great charge employed
1	he seemed or fixed in cogitation deep 
1	glad was the spirit impure as now in hope
1	to find who might direct his wandering flight
1	to paradise the happy seat of man 
1	his journey s end and our beginning woe 
1	but first he casts to change his proper shape 
1	which else might work him danger or delay 
1	and now a stripling cherub he appears 
1	not of the prime yet such as in his face
1	youth smiled celestial and to every limb
1	suitable grace diffused so well he feigned 
1	under a coronet his flowing hair
1	in curls on either cheek played wings he wore
1	of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold 
1	his habit fit for speed succinct and held
1	before his decent steps a silver wand 
1	he drew not nigh unheard the angel bright 
1	ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned 
1	admonished by his ear and straight was known
1	the arch angel uriel one of the seven
1	who in god s presence nearest to his throne 
1	stand ready at command and are his eyes
1	that run through all the heavens or down to the earth
1	bear his swift errands over moist and dry 
1	o er sea and land him satan thus accosts 
1	uriel for thou of those seven spirits that stand
1	in sight of god s high throne gloriously bright 
1	the first art wont his great authentick will
1	interpreter through highest heaven to bring 
1	where all his sons thy embassy attend 
1	and here art likeliest by supreme decree
1	like honour to obtain and as his eye
1	to visit oft this new creation round 
1	unspeakable desire to see and know
1	all these his wonderous works but chiefly man 
1	his chief delight and favour him for whom
1	all these his works so wonderous he ordained 
1	hath brought me from the quires of cherubim
1	alone thus wandering brightest seraph tell
1	in which of all these shining orbs hath man
1	his fixed seat or fixed seat hath none 
1	but all these shining orbs his choice to dwell 
1	that i may find him and with secret gaze
1	or open admiration him behold 
1	on whom the great creator hath bestowed
1	worlds and on whom hath all these graces poured 
1	that both in him and all things as is meet 
1	the universal maker we may praise 
1	who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
1	to deepest hell and to repair that loss 
1	created this new happy race of men
1	to serve him better wise are all his ways 
1	so spake the false dissembler unperceived 
1	for neither man nor angel can discern
1	hypocrisy the only evil that walks
1	invisible except to god alone 
1	by his permissive will through heaven and earth 
1	and oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps
1	at wisdom s gate and to simplicity
1	resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill
1	where no ill seems which now for once beguiled
1	uriel though regent of the sun and held
1	the sharpest sighted spirit of all in heaven 
1	who to the fraudulent impostor foul 
1	in his uprightness answer thus returned 
1	fair angel thy desire which tends to know
1	the works of god thereby to glorify
1	the great work master leads to no excess
1	that reaches blame but rather merits praise
1	the more it seems excess that led thee hither
1	from thy empyreal mansion thus alone 
1	to witness with thine eyes what some perhaps 
1	contented with report hear only in heaven 
1	for wonderful indeed are all his works 
1	pleasant to know and worthiest to be all
1	had in remembrance always with delight 
1	but what created mind can comprehend
1	their number or the wisdom infinite
1	that brought them forth but hid their causes deep 
1	i saw when at his word the formless mass 
1	this world s material mould came to a heap 
1	confusion heard his voice and wild uproar
1	stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined 
1	till at his second bidding darkness fled 
1	light shone and order from disorder sprung 
1	swift to their several quarters hasted then
1	the cumbrous elements earth flood air fire 
1	and this ethereal quintessence of heaven
1	flew upward spirited with various forms 
1	that rolled orbicular and turned to stars
1	numberless as thou seest and how they move 
1	each had his place appointed each his course 
1	the rest in circuit walls this universe 
1	look downward on that globe whose hither side
1	with light from hence though but reflected shines 
1	that place is earth the seat of man that light
1	his day which else as the other hemisphere 
1	night would invade but there the neighbouring moon
1	 so call that opposite fair star her aid
1	timely interposes and her monthly round
1	still ending still renewing through mid heaven 
1	with borrowed light her countenance triform
1	hence fills and empties to enlighten the earth 
1	and in her pale dominion checks the night 
1	that spot to which i point is paradise 
1	adam s abode those lofty shades his bower 
1	thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires 
1	thus said he turned and satan bowing low 
1	as to superiour spirits is wont in heaven 
1	where honour due and reverence none neglects 
1	took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath 
1	down from the ecliptick sped with hoped success 
1	throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel 
1	nor staid till on niphates top he lights 
1	o for that warning voice which he who saw
1	the apocalypse heard cry in heaven aloud 
1	then when the dragon put to second rout 
1	came furious down to be revenged on men 
1	woe to the inhabitants on earth that now 
1	while time was our first parents had been warned
1	the coming of their secret foe and scaped 
1	haply so scaped his mortal snare for now
1	satan now first inflamed with rage came down 
1	the tempter ere the accuser of mankind 
1	to wreak on innocent frail man his loss
1	of that first battle and his flight to hell 
1	yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold
1	far off and fearless nor with cause to boast 
1	begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth
1	now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast 
1	and like a devilish engine back recoils
1	upon himself horrour and doubt distract
1	his troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir
1	the hell within him for within him hell
1	he brings and round about him nor from hell
1	one step no more than from himself can fly
1	by change of place now conscience wakes despair 
1	that slumbered wakes the bitter memory
1	of what he was what is and what must be
1	worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue 
1	sometimes towards eden which now in his view
1	lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad 
1	sometimes towards heaven and the full blazing sun 
1	which now sat high in his meridian tower 
1	then much revolving thus in sighs began 
1	o thou that with surpassing glory crowned 
1	lookest from thy sole dominion like the god
1	of this new world at whose sight all the stars
1	hide their diminished heads to thee i call 
1	but with no friendly voice and add thy name 
1	of sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams 
1	that bring to my remembrance from what state
1	i fell how glorious once above thy sphere 
1	till pride and worse ambition threw me down
1	warring in heaven against heaven s matchless king 
1	ah wherefore he deserved no such return
1	from me whom he created what i was
1	in that bright eminence and with his good
1	upbraided none nor was his service hard 
1	what could be less than to afford him praise 
1	the easiest recompence and pay him thanks 
1	how due yet all his good proved ill in me 
1	and wrought but malice lifted up so high
1	i sdeined subjection and thought one step higher
1	would set me highest and in a moment quit
1	the debt immense of endless gratitude 
1	so burdensome still paying still to owe 
1	forgetful what from him i still received 
1	and understood not that a grateful mind
1	by owing owes not but still pays at once
1	indebted and discharged what burden then
1	o had his powerful destiny ordained
1	me some inferiour angel i had stood
1	then happy no unbounded hope had raised
1	ambition yet why not some other power
1	as great might have aspired and me though mean 
1	drawn to his part but other powers as great
1	fell not but stand unshaken from within
1	or from without to all temptations armed 
1	hadst thou the same free will and power to stand 
1	thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse 
1	but heaven s free love dealt equally to all 
1	be then his love accursed since love or hate 
1	to me alike it deals eternal woe 
1	nay cursed be thou since against his thy will
1	chose freely what it now so justly rues 
1	me miserable which way shall i fly
1	infinite wrath and infinite despair 
1	which way i fly is hell myself am hell 
1	and in the lowest deep a lower deep
1	still threatening to devour me opens wide 
1	to which the hell i suffer seems a heaven 
1	o then at last relent is there no place
1	left for repentance none for pardon left 
1	none left but by submission and that word
1	disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
1	among the spirits beneath whom i seduced
1	with other promises and other vaunts
1	than to submit boasting i could subdue
1	the omnipotent ay me they little know
1	how dearly i abide that boast so vain 
1	under what torments inwardly i groan 
1	while they adore me on the throne of hell 
1	with diadem and scepter high advanced 
1	the lower still i fall only supreme
1	in misery such joy ambition finds 
1	but say i could repent and could obtain 
1	by act of grace my former state how soon
1	would highth recall high thoughts how soon unsay
1	what feigned submission swore ease would recant
1	vows made in pain as violent and void 
1	for never can true reconcilement grow 
1	where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep 
1	which would but lead me to a worse relapse
1	and heavier fall so should i purchase dear
1	short intermission bought with double smart 
1	this knows my punisher therefore as far
1	from granting he as i from begging peace 
1	all hope excluded thus behold instead
1	of us out cast exil d his new delight 
1	mankind created and for him this world 
1	so farewell hope and with hope farewell fear 
1	farewell remorse all good to me is lost 
1	evil be thou my good by thee at least
1	divided empire with heaven s king i hold 
1	by thee and more than half perhaps will reign 
1	as man ere long and this new world shall know 
1	thus while he spake each passion dimmed his face
1	thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair 
1	which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed
1	him counterfeit if any eye beheld 
1	for heavenly minds from such distempers foul
1	are ever clear whereof he soon aware 
1	each perturbation smoothed with outward calm 
1	artificer of fraud and was the first
1	that practised falsehood under saintly show 
1	deep malice to conceal couched with revenge 
1	yet not enough had practised to deceive
1	uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down
1	the way he went and on the assyrian mount
1	saw him disfigured more than could befall
1	spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce
1	he marked and mad demeanour then alone 
1	as he supposed all unobserved unseen 
1	so on he fares and to the border comes
1	of eden where delicious paradise 
1	now nearer crowns with her enclosure green 
1	as with a rural mound the champaign head
1	of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides
1	with thicket overgrown grotesque and wild 
1	access denied and overhead upgrew
1	insuperable height of loftiest shade 
1	cedar and pine and fir and branching palm 
1	a sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend 
1	shade above shade a woody theatre
1	of stateliest view yet higher than their tops
1	the verdurous wall of paradise upsprung 
1	which to our general sire gave prospect large
1	into his nether empire neighbouring round 
1	and higher than that wall a circling row
1	of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit 
1	blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue 
1	appeared with gay enamelled colours mixed 
1	on which the sun more glad impressed his beams
1	than in fair evening cloud or humid bow 
1	when god hath showered the earth so lovely seemed
1	that landskip and of pure now purer air
1	meets his approach and to the heart inspires
1	vernal delight and joy able to drive
1	all sadness but despair now gentle gales 
1	fanning their odoriferous wings dispense
1	native perfumes and whisper whence they stole
1	those balmy spoils as when to them who fail
1	beyond the cape of hope and now are past
1	mozambick off at sea north east winds blow
1	sabean odours from the spicy shore
1	of araby the blest with such delay
1	well pleased they slack their course and many a league
1	cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles 
1	so entertained those odorous sweets the fiend 
1	who came their bane though with them better pleased
1	than asmodeus with the fishy fume
1	that drove him though enamoured from the spouse
1	of tobit s son and with a vengeance sent
1	now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
1	satan had journeyed on pensive and slow 
1	but further way found none so thick entwined 
1	as one continued brake the undergrowth
1	of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
1	all path of man or beast that passed that way 
1	one gate there only was and that looked east
1	on the other side which when the arch felon saw 
1	due entrance he disdained and in contempt 
1	at one flight bound high over leaped all bound
1	of hill or highest wall and sheer within
1	lights on his feet as when a prowling wolf 
1	whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey 
1	watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
1	in hurdled cotes amid the field secure 
1	leaps o er the fence with ease into the fold 
1	or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash
1	of some rich burgher whose substantial doors 
1	cross barred and bolted fast fear no assault 
1	in at the window climbs or o er the tiles 
1	so clomb this first grand thief into god s fold 
1	so since into his church lewd hirelings climb 
1	thence up he flew and on the tree of life 
1	the middle tree and highest there that grew 
1	sat like a cormorant yet not true life
1	thereby regained but sat devising death
1	to them who lived nor on the virtue thought
1	of that life giving plant but only used
1	for prospect what well used had been the pledge
1	of immortality so little knows
1	any but god alone to value right
1	the good before him but perverts best things
1	to worst abuse or to their meanest use 
1	beneath him with new wonder now he views 
1	to all delight of human sense exposed 
1	in narrow room nature s whole wealth yea more 
1	a heaven on earth for blissful paradise
1	of god the garden was by him in the east
1	of eden planted eden stretched her line
1	from auran eastward to the royal towers
1	of great seleucia built by grecian kings 
1	or where the sons of eden long before
1	dwelt in telassar in this pleasant soil
1	his far more pleasant garden god ordained 
1	out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
1	all trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste 
1	and all amid them stood the tree of life 
1	high eminent blooming ambrosial fruit
1	of vegetable gold and next to life 
1	our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by 
1	knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill 
1	southward through eden went a river large 
1	nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill
1	passed underneath ingulfed for god had thrown
1	that mountain as his garden mould high raised
1	upon the rapid current which through veins
1	of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn 
1	rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
1	watered the garden thence united fell
1	down the steep glade and met the nether flood 
1	which from his darksome passage now appears 
1	and now divided into four main streams 
1	runs diverse wandering many a famous realm
1	and country whereof here needs no account 
1	but rather to tell how if art could tell 
1	how from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks 
1	rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold 
1	with mazy errour under pendant shades
1	ran nectar visiting each plant and fed
1	flowers worthy of paradise which not nice art
1	in beds and curious knots but nature boon
1	poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain 
1	both where the morning sun first warmly smote
1	the open field and where the unpierced shade
1	imbrowned the noontide bowers thus was this place
1	a happy rural seat of various view 
1	groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm 
1	others whose fruit burnished with golden rind 
1	hung amiable hesperian fables true 
1	if true here only and of delicious taste 
1	betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks
1	grazing the tender herb were interposed 
1	or palmy hillock or the flowery lap
1	of some irriguous valley spread her store 
1	flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose 
1	another side umbrageous grots and caves
1	of cool recess o er which the mantling vine
1	lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps
1	luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall
1	down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake 
1	that to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
1	her crystal mirrour holds unite their streams 
1	the birds their quire apply airs vernal airs 
1	breathing the smell of field and grove attune
1	the trembling leaves while universal pan 
1	knit with the graces and the hours in dance 
1	led on the eternal spring not that fair field
1	of enna where proserpine gathering flowers 
1	herself a fairer flower by gloomy dis
1	was gathered which cost ceres all that pain
1	to seek her through the world nor that sweet grove
1	of daphne by orontes and the inspired
1	castalian spring might with this paradise
1	of eden strive nor that nyseian isle
1	girt with the river triton where old cham 
1	whom gentiles ammon call and libyan jove 
1	hid amalthea and her florid son
1	young bacchus from his stepdame rhea s eye 
1	nor where abassin kings their issue guard 
1	mount amara though this by some supposed
1	true paradise under the ethiop line
1	by nilus head enclosed with shining rock 
1	a whole day s journey high but wide remote
1	from this assyrian garden where the fiend
1	saw undelighted all delight all kind
1	of living creatures new to sight and strange
1	two of far nobler shape erect and tall 
1	godlike erect with native honour clad
1	in naked majesty seemed lords of all 
1	and worthy seemed for in their looks divine
1	the image of their glorious maker shone 
1	truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure 
1	 severe but in true filial freedom placed 
1	whence true authority in men though both
1	not equal as their sex not equal seemed 
1	for contemplation he and valour formed 
1	for softness she and sweet attractive grace 
1	he for god only she for god in him 
1	his fair large front and eye sublime declared
1	absolute rule and hyacinthine locks
1	round from his parted forelock manly hung
1	clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad 
1	she as a veil down to the slender waist
1	her unadorned golden tresses wore
1	dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved
1	as the vine curls her tendrils which implied
1	subjection but required with gentle sway 
1	and by her yielded by him best received 
1	yielded with coy submission modest pride 
1	and sweet reluctant amorous delay 
1	nor those mysterious parts were then concealed 
1	then was not guilty shame dishonest shame
1	of nature s works honour dishonourable 
1	sin bred how have ye troubled all mankind
1	with shows instead mere shows of seeming pure 
1	and banished from man s life his happiest life 
1	simplicity and spotless innocence 
1	so passed they naked on nor shunned the sight
1	of god or angel for they thought no ill 
1	so hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair 
1	that ever since in love s embraces met 
1	adam the goodliest man of men since born
1	his sons the fairest of her daughters eve 
1	under a tuft of shade that on a green
1	stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side
1	they sat them down and after no more toil
1	of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed
1	to recommend cool zephyr and made ease
1	more easy wholesome thirst and appetite
1	more grateful to their supper fruits they fell 
1	nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
1	yielded them side long as they sat recline
1	on the soft downy bank damasked with flowers 
1	the savoury pulp they chew and in the rind 
1	still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream 
1	nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles
1	wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems
1	fair couple linked in happy nuptial league 
1	alone as they about them frisking played
1	all beasts of the earth since wild and of all chase
1	in wood or wilderness forest or den 
1	sporting the lion ramped and in his paw
1	dandled the kid bears tigers ounces pards 
1	gambolled before them the unwieldy elephant 
1	to make them mirth used all his might and wreathed
1	his lithe proboscis close the serpent sly 
1	insinuating wove with gordian twine
1	his braided train and of his fatal guile
1	gave proof unheeded others on the grass
1	couched and now filled with pasture gazing sat 
1	or bedward ruminating for the sun 
1	declined was hasting now with prone career
1	to the ocean isles and in the ascending scale
1	of heaven the stars that usher evening rose 
1	when satan still in gaze as first he stood 
1	scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad 
1	o hell what do mine eyes with grief behold 
1	into our room of bliss thus high advanced
1	creatures of other mould earth born perhaps 
1	not spirits yet to heavenly spirits bright
1	little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue
1	with wonder and could love so lively shines
1	in them divine resemblance and such grace
1	the hand that formed them on their shape hath poured 
1	ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh
1	your change approaches when all these delights
1	will vanish and deliver ye to woe 
1	more woe the more your taste is now of joy 
1	happy but for so happy ill secured
1	long to continue and this high seat your heaven
1	ill fenced for heaven to keep out such a foe
1	as now is entered yet no purposed foe
1	to you whom i could pity thus forlorn 
1	though i unpitied league with you i seek 
1	and mutual amity so strait so close 
1	that i with you must dwell or you with me
1	henceforth my dwelling haply may not please 
1	like this fair paradise your sense yet such
1	accept your maker s work he gave it me 
1	which i as freely give hell shall unfold 
1	to entertain you two her widest gates 
1	and send forth all her kings there will be room 
1	not like these narrow limits to receive
1	your numerous offspring if no better place 
1	thank him who puts me loth to this revenge
1	on you who wrong me not for him who wronged 
1	and should i at your harmless innocence
1	melt as i do yet publick reason just 
1	honour and empire with revenge enlarged 
1	by conquering this new world compels me now
1	to do what else though damned i should abhor 
1	so spake the fiend and with necessity 
1	the tyrant s plea excused his devilish deeds 
1	then from his lofty stand on that high tree
1	down he alights among the sportful herd
1	of those four footed kinds himself now one 
1	now other as their shape served best his end
1	nearer to view his prey and unespied 
1	to mark what of their state he more might learn 
1	by word or action marked about them round
1	a lion now he stalks with fiery glare 
1	then as a tiger who by chance hath spied
1	in some purlieu two gentle fawns at play 
1	straight couches close then rising changes oft
1	his couchant watch as one who chose his ground 
1	whence rushing he might surest seize them both 
1	griped in each paw when adam first of men
1	to first of women eve thus moving speech 
1	turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow 
1	sole partner and sole part of all these joys 
1	dearer thyself than all needs must the power
1	that made us and for us this ample world 
1	be infinitely good and of his good
1	as liberal and free as infinite 
1	that raised us from the dust and placed us here
1	in all this happiness who at his hand
1	have nothing merited nor can perform
1	aught whereof he hath need he who requires
1	from us no other service than to keep
1	this one this easy charge of all the trees
1	in paradise that bear delicious fruit
1	so various not to taste that only tree
1	of knowledge planted by the tree of life 
1	so near grows death to life whate er death is 
1	some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest
1	god hath pronounced it death to taste that tree 
1	the only sign of our obedience left 
1	among so many signs of power and rule
1	conferred upon us and dominion given
1	over all other creatures that possess
1	earth air and sea then let us not think hard
1	one easy prohibition who enjoy
1	free leave so large to all things else and choice
1	unlimited of manifold delights 
1	but let us ever praise him and extol
1	his bounty following our delightful task 
1	to prune these growing plants and tend these flowers 
1	which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet 
1	to whom thus eve replied o thou for whom
1	and from whom i was formed flesh of thy flesh 
1	and without whom am to no end my guide
1	and head what thou hast said is just and right 
1	for we to him indeed all praises owe 
1	and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy
1	so far the happier lot enjoying thee
1	pre eminent by so much odds while thou
1	like consort to thyself canst no where find 
1	that day i oft remember when from sleep
1	i first awaked and found myself reposed
1	under a shade on flowers much wondering where
1	and what i was whence thither brought and how 
1	not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
1	of waters issued from a cave and spread
1	into a liquid plain then stood unmoved
1	pure as the expanse of heaven i thither went
1	with unexperienced thought and laid me down
1	on the green bank to look into the clear
1	smooth lake that to me seemed another sky 
1	as i bent down to look just opposite
1	a shape within the watery gleam appeared 
1	bending to look on me i started back 
1	it started back but pleased i soon returned 
1	pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
1	of sympathy and love there i had fixed
1	mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire 
1	had not a voice thus warned me what thou seest 
1	what there thou seest fair creature is thyself 
1	with thee it came and goes but follow me 
1	and i will bring thee where no shadow stays
1	thy coming and thy soft embraces he
1	whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy
1	inseparably thine to him shalt bear
1	multitudes like thyself and thence be called
1	mother of human race what could i do 
1	but follow straight invisibly thus led 
1	till i espied thee fair indeed and tall 
1	under a platane yet methought less fair 
1	less winning soft less amiably mild 
1	than that smooth watery image back i turned 
1	thou following cryedst aloud return fair eve 
1	whom flyest thou whom thou flyest of him thou art 
1	his flesh his bone to give thee being i lent
1	out of my side to thee nearest my heart 
1	substantial life to have thee by my side
1	henceforth an individual solace dear 
1	part of my soul i seek thee and thee claim
1	my other half with that thy gentle hand
1	seised mine i yielded and from that time see
1	how beauty is excelled by manly grace 
1	and wisdom which alone is truly fair 
1	so spake our general mother and with eyes
1	of conjugal attraction unreproved 
1	and meek surrender half embracing leaned
1	on our first father half her swelling breast
1	naked met his under the flowing gold
1	of her loose tresses hid he in delight
1	both of her beauty and submissive charms 
1	smiled with superiour love as jupiter
1	on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
1	that shed mayflowers and pressed her matron lip
1	with kisses pure aside the devil turned
1	for envy yet with jealous leer malign
1	eyed them askance and to himself thus plained 
1	sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two 
1	imparadised in one another s arms 
1	the happier eden shall enjoy their fill
1	of bliss on bliss while i to hell am thrust 
1	where neither joy nor love but fierce desire 
1	among our other torments not the least 
1	still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines 
1	yet let me not forget what i have gained
1	from their own mouths all is not theirs it seems 
1	one fatal tree there stands of knowledge called 
1	forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidden
1	suspicious reasonless why should their lord
1	envy them that can it be sin to know 
1	can it be death and do they only stand
1	by ignorance is that their happy state 
1	the proof of their obedience and their faith 
1	o fair foundation laid whereon to build
1	their ruin hence i will excite their minds
1	with more desire to know and to reject
1	envious commands invented with design
1	to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
1	equal with gods aspiring to be such 
1	they taste and die what likelier can ensue
1	but first with narrow search i must walk round
1	this garden and no corner leave unspied 
1	a chance but chance may lead where i may meet
1	some wandering spirit of heaven by fountain side 
1	or in thick shade retired from him to draw
1	what further would be learned live while ye may 
1	yet happy pair enjoy till i return 
1	short pleasures for long woes are to succeed 
1	so saying his proud step he scornful turned 
1	but with sly circumspection and began
1	through wood through waste o er hill o er dale his roam
1	mean while in utmost longitude where heaven
1	with earth and ocean meets the setting sun
1	slowly descended and with right aspect
1	against the eastern gate of paradise
1	levelled his evening rays it was a rock
1	of alabaster piled up to the clouds 
1	conspicuous far winding with one ascent
1	accessible from earth one entrance high 
1	the rest was craggy cliff that overhung
1	still as it rose impossible to climb 
1	betwixt these rocky pillars gabriel sat 
1	chief of the angelick guards awaiting night 
1	about him exercised heroick games
1	the unarmed youth of heaven but nigh at hand
1	celestial armoury shields helms and spears 
1	hung high with diamond flaming and with gold 
1	thither came uriel gliding through the even
1	on a sun beam swift as a shooting star
1	in autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired
1	impress the air and shows the mariner
1	from what point of his compass to beware
1	impetuous winds he thus began in haste 
1	gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given
1	charge and strict watch that to this happy place
1	no evil thing approach or enter in 
1	this day at highth of noon came to my sphere
1	a spirit zealous as he seemed to know
1	more of the almighty s works and chiefly man 
1	god s latest image i described his way
1	bent all on speed and marked his aery gait 
1	but in the mount that lies from eden north 
1	where he first lighted soon discerned his looks
1	alien from heaven with passions foul obscured 
1	mine eye pursued him still but under shade
1	lost sight of him one of the banished crew 
1	i fear hath ventured from the deep to raise
1	new troubles him thy care must be to find 
1	to whom the winged warriour thus returned 
1	uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight 
1	amid the sun s bright circle where thou sitst 
1	see far and wide in at this gate none pass
1	the vigilance here placed but such as come
1	well known from heaven and since meridian hour
1	no creature thence if spirit of other sort 
1	so minded have o er leaped these earthly bounds
1	on purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude
1	spiritual substance with corporeal bar 
1	but if within the circuit of these walks 
1	in whatsoever shape he lurk of whom
1	thou tellest by morrow dawning i shall know 
1	so promised he and uriel to his charge
1	returned on that bright beam whose point now raised
1	bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
1	beneath the azores whether the prime orb 
1	incredible how swift had thither rolled
1	diurnal or this less volubil earth 
1	by shorter flight to the east had left him there
1	arraying with reflected purple and gold
1	the clouds that on his western throne attend 
1	now came still evening on and twilight gray
1	had in her sober livery all things clad 
1	silence accompanied for beast and bird 
1	they to their grassy couch these to their nests
1	were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale 
1	she all night long her amorous descant sung 
1	silence was pleased now glowed the firmament
1	with living sapphires hesperus that led
1	the starry host rode brightest till the moon 
1	rising in clouded majesty at length
1	apparent queen unveiled her peerless light 
1	and o er the dark her silver mantle threw 
1	when adam thus to eve fair consort the hour
1	of night and all things now retired to rest 
1	mind us of like repose since god hath set
1	labour and rest as day and night to men
1	successive and the timely dew of sleep 
1	now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
1	our eye lids other creatures all day long
1	rove idle unemployed and less need rest 
1	man hath his daily work of body or mind
1	appointed which declares his dignity 
1	and the regard of heaven on all his ways 
1	while other animals unactive range 
1	and of their doings god takes no account 
1	to morrow ere fresh morning streak the east
1	with first approach of light we must be risen 
1	and at our pleasant labour to reform
1	yon flowery arbours yonder alleys green 
1	our walk at noon with branches overgrown 
1	that mock our scant manuring and require
1	more hands than ours to lop their wanton growth 
1	those blossoms also and those dropping gums 
1	that lie bestrown unsightly and unsmooth 
1	ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease 
1	mean while as nature wills night bids us rest 
1	to whom thus eve with perfect beauty adorned
1	my author and disposer what thou bidst
1	unargued i obey so god ordains 
1	god is thy law thou mine to know no more
1	is woman s happiest knowledge and her praise 
1	with thee conversing i forget all time 
1	all seasons and their change all please alike 
1	sweet is the breath of morn her rising sweet 
1	with charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun 
1	when first on this delightful land he spreads
1	his orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower 
1	glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth
1	after soft showers and sweet the coming on
1	of grateful evening mild then silent night 
1	with this her solemn bird and this fair moon 
1	and these the gems of heaven her starry train 
1	but neither breath of morn when she ascends
1	with charm of earliest birds nor rising sun
1	on this delightful land nor herb fruit flower 
1	glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers 
1	nor grateful evening mild nor silent night 
1	with this her solemn bird nor walk by moon 
1	or glittering star light without thee is sweet 
1	but wherefore all night long shine these for whom
1	this glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes 
1	to whom our general ancestor replied 
1	daughter of god and man accomplished eve 
1	these have their course to finish round the earth 
1	by morrow evening and from land to land
1	in order though to nations yet unborn 
1	ministring light prepared they set and rise 
1	lest total darkness should by night regain
1	her old possession and extinguish life
1	in nature and all things which these soft fires
1	not only enlighten but with kindly heat
1	of various influence foment and warm 
1	temper or nourish or in part shed down
1	their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
1	on earth made hereby apter to receive
1	perfection from the sun s more potent ray 
1	these then though unbeheld in deep of night 
1	shine not in vain nor think though men were none 
1	that heaven would want spectators god want praise 
1	millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
1	unseen both when we wake and when we sleep 
1	all these with ceaseless praise his works behold
1	both day and night how often from the steep
1	of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
1	celestial voices to the midnight air 
1	sole or responsive each to others note 
1	singing their great creator oft in bands
1	while they keep watch or nightly rounding walk 
1	with heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
1	in full harmonick number joined their songs
1	divide the night and lift our thoughts to heaven 
1	thus talking hand in hand alone they passed
1	on to their blissful bower it was a place
1	chosen by the sovran planter when he framed
1	all things to man s delightful use the roof
1	of thickest covert was inwoven shade
1	laurel and myrtle and what higher grew
1	of firm and fragrant leaf on either side
1	acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub 
1	fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower 
1	iris all hues roses and jessamin 
1	reared high their flourished heads between and wrought
1	mosaick underfoot the violet 
1	crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay
1	broidered the ground more coloured than with stone
1	of costliest emblem other creature here 
1	bird beast insect or worm durst enter none 
1	such was their awe of man in shadier bower

1	espoused eve decked first her nuptial bed 
1	and heavenly quires the hymenaean sung 
1	what day the genial angel to our sire
1	brought her in naked beauty more adorned 
1	more lovely than pandora whom the gods
1	endowed with all their gifts and o too like
1	in sad event when to the unwiser son
1	mankind with her fair looks to be avenged
1	on him who had stole jove s authentick fire 
1	thus at their shady lodge arrived both stood 
1	both turned and under open sky adored
1	the god that made both sky air earth and heaven 
1	which they beheld the moon s resplendent globe 
1	and starry pole thou also madest the night 
1	maker omnipotent and thou the day 
1	which we in our appointed work employed 
1	have finished happy in our mutual help
1	and mutual love the crown of all our bliss
1	ordained by thee and this delicious place
1	for us too large where thy abundance wants
1	partakers and uncropt falls to the ground 
1	but thou hast promised from us two a race
1	to fill the earth who shall with us extol
1	thy goodness infinite both when we wake 
1	and when we seek as now thy gift of sleep 
1	this said unanimous and other rites
1	observing none but adoration pure
1	which god likes best into their inmost bower

1	these troublesome disguises which we wear 
1	straight side by side were laid nor turned i ween

1	mysterious of connubial love refused 
1	whatever hypocrites austerely talk
1	of purity and place and innocence

1	our maker bids encrease who bids abstain
1	hail wedded love mysterious law true source
1	of human offspring sole propriety
1	in paradise of all things common else 
1	by thee adulterous lust was driven from men
1	among the bestial herds to range by thee
1	founded in reason loyal just and pure

1	whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced 
1	present or past as saints and patriarchs used 
1	here love his golden shafts employs here lights
1	his constant lamp and waves his purple wings 
1	reigns here and revels not in the bought smile
1	of harlots loveless joyless unendeared 
1	casual fruition nor in court amours 
1	mixed dance or wanton mask or midnight ball 
1	or serenate which the starved lover sings

1	and on their naked limbs the flowery roof
1	showered roses which the morn repaired sleep on 
1	blest pair and o yet happiest if ye seek
1	no happier state and know to know no more 
1	now had night measured with her shadowy cone
1	half way up hill this vast sublunar vault 
1	and from their ivory port the cherubim 
1	forth issuing at the accustomed hour stood armed
1	to their night watches in warlike parade 
1	when gabriel to his next in power thus spake 
1	uzziel half these draw off and coast the south
1	with strictest watch these other wheel the north 
1	our circuit meets full west as flame they part 
1	half wheeling to the shield half to the spear 
1	from these two strong and subtle spirits he called
1	that near him stood and gave them thus in charge 
1	ithuriel and zephon with winged speed
1	search through this garden leave unsearched no nook 
1	but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge 
1	now laid perhaps asleep secure of harm 
1	this evening from the sun s decline arrived 
1	who tells of some infernal spirit seen
1	hitherward bent who could have thought escaped
1	the bars of hell on errand bad no doubt 
1	such where ye find seise fast and hither bring 
1	so saying on he led his radiant files 
1	dazzling the moon these to the bower direct
1	in search of whom they sought him there they found
1	squat like a toad close at the ear of eve 
1	assaying by his devilish art to reach
1	the organs of her fancy and with them forge
1	illusions as he list phantasms and dreams 
1	or if inspiring venom he might taint
1	the animal spirits that from pure blood arise
1	like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
1	at least distempered discontented thoughts 
1	vain hopes vain aims inordinate desires 
1	blown up with high conceits ingendering pride 
1	him thus intent ithuriel with his spear
1	touched lightly for no falshood can endure
1	touch of celestial temper but returns
1	of force to its own likeness up he starts
1	discovered and surprised as when a spark
1	lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
1	fit for the tun some magazine to store
1	against a rumoured war the smutty grain 
1	with sudden blaze diffused inflames the air 
1	so started up in his own shape the fiend 
1	back stept those two fair angels half amazed
1	so sudden to behold the grisly king 
1	yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon 
1	which of those rebel spirits adjudged to hell
1	comest thou escaped thy prison and transformed 
1	why sat st thou like an enemy in wait 
1	here watching at the head of these that sleep 
1	know ye not then said satan filled with scorn 
1	know ye not me ye knew me once no mate
1	for you there sitting where ye durst not soar 
1	not to know me argues yourselves unknown 
1	the lowest of your throng or if ye know 
1	why ask ye and superfluous begin
1	your message like to end as much in vain 
1	to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn 
1	think not revolted spirit thy shape the same 
1	or undiminished brightness to be known 
1	as when thou stoodest in heaven upright and pure 
1	that glory then when thou no more wast good 
1	departed from thee and thou resemblest now
1	thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul 
1	but come for thou be sure shalt give account
1	to him who sent us whose charge is to keep
1	this place inviolable and these from harm 
1	so spake the cherub and his grave rebuke 
1	severe in youthful beauty added grace
1	invincible abashed the devil stood 
1	and felt how awful goodness is and saw
1	virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined
1	his loss but chiefly to find here observed
1	his lustre visibly impaired yet seemed
1	undaunted if i must contend said he 
1	best with the best the sender not the sent 
1	or all at once more glory will be won 
1	or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold 
1	will save us trial what the least can do
1	single against thee wicked and thence weak 
1	the fiend replied not overcome with rage 
1	but like a proud steed reined went haughty on 
1	champing his iron curb to strive or fly
1	he held it vain awe from above had quelled
1	his heart not else dismayed now drew they nigh
1	the western point where those half rounding guards
1	just met and closing stood in squadron joined 
1	a waiting next command to whom their chief 
1	gabriel from the front thus called aloud 
1	o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet
1	hasting this way and now by glimpse discern
1	ithuriel and zephon through the shade 
1	and with them comes a third of regal port 
1	but faded splendour wan who by his gait
1	and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell 
1	not likely to part hence without contest 
1	stand firm for in his look defiance lours 
1	he scarce had ended when those two approached 
1	and brief related whom they brought where found 
1	how busied in what form and posture couched 
1	to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake 
1	why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescribed
1	to thy transgressions and disturbed the charge
1	of others who approve not to transgress
1	by thy example but have power and right
1	to question thy bold entrance on this place 
1	employed it seems to violate sleep and those
1	whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss 
1	to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow 
1	gabriel thou hadst in heaven the esteem of wise 
1	and such i held thee but this question asked
1	puts me in doubt lives there who loves his pain 
1	who would not finding way break loose from hell 
1	though thither doomed thou wouldst thyself no doubt
1	and boldly venture to whatever place
1	farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
1	torment with ease and soonest recompense
1	dole with delight which in this place i sought 
1	to thee no reason who knowest only good 
1	but evil hast not tried and wilt object
1	his will who bounds us let him surer bar
1	his iron gates if he intends our stay
1	in that dark durance thus much what was asked 
1	the rest is true they found me where they say 
1	but that implies not violence or harm 
1	thus he in scorn the warlike angel moved 
1	disdainfully half smiling thus replied 
1	o loss of one in heaven to judge of wise
1	since satan fell whom folly overthrew 
1	and now returns him from his prison scaped 
1	gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
1	or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
1	unlicensed from his bounds in hell prescribed 
1	so wise he judges it to fly from pain
1	however and to scape his punishment 
1	so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath 
1	which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight
1	sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell 
1	which taught thee yet no better that no pain
1	can equal anger infinite provoked 
1	but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee
1	came not all hell broke loose or thou than they
1	less hardy to endure courageous chief 
1	the first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged
1	to thy deserted host this cause of flight 
1	thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive 
1	to which the fiend thus answered frowning stern 
1	not that i less endure or shrink from pain 
1	insulting angel well thou knowest i stood
1	thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid
1	the blasting vollied thunder made all speed 
1	and seconded thy else not dreaded spear 
1	but still thy words at random as before 
1	argue thy inexperience what behoves
1	from hard assays and ill successes past
1	a faithful leader not to hazard all
1	through ways of danger by himself untried 
1	i therefore i alone first undertook
1	to wing the desolate abyss and spy
1	this new created world whereof in hell
1	fame is not silent here in hope to find
1	better abode and my afflicted powers
1	to settle here on earth or in mid air 
1	though for possession put to try once more
1	what thou and thy gay legions dare against 
1	whose easier business were to serve their lord
1	high up in heaven with songs to hymn his throne 
1	and practised distances to cringe not fight 
1	to whom the warriour angel soon replied 
1	to say and straight unsay pretending first
1	wise to fly pain professing next the spy 
1	argues no leader but a liar traced 
1	satan and couldst thou faithful add o name 
1	o sacred name of faithfulness profaned 
1	faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew 
1	army of fiends fit body to fit head 
1	was this your discipline and faith engaged 
1	your military obedience to dissolve
1	allegiance to the acknowledged power supreme 
1	and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
1	patron of liberty who more than thou
1	once fawned and cringed and servilely adored
1	heaven s awful monarch wherefore but in hope
1	to dispossess him and thyself to reign 
1	but mark what i arreed thee now avant 
1	fly neither whence thou fledst if from this hour
1	within these hallowed limits thou appear 
1	back to the infernal pit i drag thee chained 
1	and seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn
1	the facile gates of hell too slightly barred 
1	so threatened he but satan to no threats
1	gave heed but waxing more in rage replied 
1	then when i am thy captive talk of chains 
1	proud limitary cherub but ere then
1	far heavier load thyself expect to feel
1	from my prevailing arm though heaven s king
1	ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers 
1	us d to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels
1	in progress through the road of heaven star paved 
1	while thus he spake the angelick squadron bright
1	turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns
1	their phalanx and began to hem him round
1	with ported spears as thick as when a field
1	of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
1	her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
1	sways them the careful plowman doubting stands 
1	left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
1	prove chaff on the other side satan alarmed 
1	collecting all his might dilated stood 
1	like teneriff or atlas unremoved 
1	his stature reached the sky and on his crest
1	sat horrour plumed nor wanted in his grasp
1	what seemed both spear and shield now dreadful deeds
1	might have ensued nor only paradise
1	in this commotion but the starry cope
1	of heaven perhaps or all the elements
1	at least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn
1	with violence of this conflict had not soon
1	the eternal to prevent such horrid fray 
1	hung forth in heaven his golden scales yet seen
1	betwixt astrea and the scorpion sign 
1	wherein all things created first he weighed 
1	the pendulous round earth with balanced air
1	in counterpoise now ponders all events 
1	battles and realms in these he put two weights 
1	the sequel each of parting and of fight 
1	the latter quick up flew and kicked the beam 
1	which gabriel spying thus bespake the fiend 
1	satan i know thy strength and thou knowest mine 
1	neither our own but given what folly then
1	to boast what arms can do since thine no more
1	than heaven permits nor mine though doubled now
1	to trample thee as mire for proof look up 
1	and read thy lot in yon celestial sign 
1	where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak 
1	if thou resist the fiend looked up and knew
1	his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled
1	murmuring and with him fled the shades of night 
1	now morn her rosy steps in the eastern clime
1	advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl 
1	when adam waked so customed for his sleep
1	was aery light from pure digestion bred 
1	and temperate vapours bland which the only sound
1	of leaves and fuming rills aurora s fan 
1	lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song
1	of birds on every bough so much the more
1	his wonder was to find unwakened eve
1	with tresses discomposed and glowing cheek 
1	as through unquiet rest he on his side
1	leaning half raised with looks of cordial love
1	hung over her enamoured and beheld
1	beauty which whether waking or asleep 
1	shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
1	mild as when zephyrus on flora breathes 
1	her hand soft touching whispered thus awake 
1	my fairest my espoused my latest found 
1	heaven s last best gift my ever new delight 
1	awake the morning shines and the fresh field
1	calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
1	our tender plants how blows the citron grove 
1	what drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed 
1	how nature paints her colours how the bee
1	sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet 
1	such whispering waked her but with startled eye
1	on adam whom embracing thus she spake 
1	o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose 
1	my glory my perfection glad i see
1	thy face and morn returned for i this night
1	 such night till this i never passed have dreamed 
1	if dreamed not as i oft am wont of thee 
1	works of day past or morrow s next design 
1	but of offence and trouble which my mind
1	knew never till this irksome night methought 
1	close at mine ear one called me forth to walk
1	with gentle voice i thought it thine it said 
1	 why sleepest thou eve now is the pleasant time 
1	the cool the silent save where silence yields
1	to the night warbling bird that now awake
1	tunes sweetest his love laboured song now reigns
1	full orbed the moon and with more pleasing light
1	shadowy sets off the face of things in vain 
1	if none regard heaven wakes with all his eyes 
1	whom to behold but thee nature s desire 
1	in whose sight all things joy with ravishment
1	attracted by thy beauty still to gaze 
1	i rose as at thy call but found thee not 
1	to find thee i directed then my walk 
1	and on methought alone i passed through ways
1	that brought me on a sudden to the tree
1	of interdicted knowledge fair it seemed 
1	much fairer to my fancy than by day 
1	and as i wondering looked beside it stood
1	one shaped and winged like one of those from heaven
1	by us oft seen his dewy locks distilled
1	ambrosia on that tree he also gazed 
1	and o fair plant said he with fruit surcharged 
1	deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet 
1	nor god nor man is knowledge so despised 
1	or envy or what reserve forbids to taste 
1	forbid who will none shall from me withhold
1	longer thy offered good why else set here 
1	this said he paused not but with venturous arm
1	he plucked he tasted me damp horrour chilled
1	at such bold words vouched with a deed so bold 
1	but he thus overjoyed o fruit divine 
1	sweet of thyself but much more sweet thus cropt 
1	forbidden here it seems as only fit
1	for gods yet able to make gods of men 
1	and why not gods of men since good the more
1	communicated more abundant grows 
1	the author not impaired but honoured more 
1	here happy creature fair angelick eve 
1	partake thou also happy though thou art 
1	happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be 
1	taste this and be henceforth among the gods
1	thyself a goddess not to earth confined 
1	but sometimes in the air as we sometimes
1	ascend to heaven by merit thine and see
1	what life the gods live there and such live thou 
1	so saying he drew nigh and to me held 
1	even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
1	which he had plucked the pleasant savoury smell
1	so quickened appetite that i methought 
1	could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds
1	with him i flew and underneath beheld
1	the earth outstretched immense a prospect wide
1	and various wondering at my flight and change
1	to this high exaltation suddenly
1	my guide was gone and i methought sunk down 
1	and fell asleep but o how glad i waked
1	to find this but a dream thus eve her night
1	related and thus adam answered sad 
1	best image of myself and dearer half 
1	the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
1	affects me equally nor can i like
1	this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear 
1	yet evil whence in thee can harbour none 
1	created pure but know that in the soul
1	are many lesser faculties that serve
1	reason as chief among these fancy next
1	her office holds of all external things
1	which the five watchful senses represent 
1	she forms imaginations aery shapes 
1	which reason joining or disjoining frames
1	all what we affirm or what deny and call
1	our knowledge or opinion then retires
1	into her private cell when nature rests 
1	oft in her absence mimick fancy wakes
1	to imitate her but misjoining shapes 
1	wild work produces oft and most in dreams 
1	ill matching words and deeds long past or late 
1	some such resemblances methinks i find
1	of our last evening s talk in this thy dream 
1	but with addition strange yet be not sad 
1	evil into the mind of god or man
1	may come and go so unreproved and leave
1	no spot or blame behind which gives me hope
1	that what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream 
1	waking thou never will consent to do 
1	be not disheartened then nor cloud those looks 
1	that wont to be more cheerful and serene 
1	than when fair morning first smiles on the world 
1	and let us to our fresh employments rise
1	among the groves the fountains and the flowers
1	that open now their choisest bosomed smells 
1	reserved from night and kept for thee in store 
1	so cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered 
1	but silently a gentle tear let fall
1	from either eye and wiped them with her hair 
1	two other precious drops that ready stood 
1	each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell
1	kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
1	and pious awe that feared to have offended 
1	so all was cleared and to the field they haste 
1	but first from under shady arborous roof
1	soon as they forth were come to open sight
1	of day spring and the sun who scarce up risen 
1	with wheels yet hovering o er the ocean brim 
1	shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray 
1	discovering in wide landskip all the east
1	of paradise and eden s happy plains 
1	lowly they bowed adoring and began
1	their orisons each morning duly paid
1	in various style for neither various style
1	nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
1	their maker in fit strains pronounced or sung
1	unmeditated such prompt eloquence
1	flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse 
1	more tuneable than needed lute or harp
1	to add more sweetness and they thus began 
1	these are thy glorious works parent of good 
1	almighty thine this universal frame 
1	thus wonderous fair thyself how wonderous then 
1	unspeakable who sitst above these heavens
1	to us invisible or dimly seen
1	in these thy lowest works yet these declare
1	thy goodness beyond thought and power divine 
1	speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light 
1	angels for ye behold him and with songs
1	and choral symphonies day without night 
1	circle his throne rejoicing ye in heaven
1	on earth join all ye creatures to extol
1	him first him last him midst and without end 
1	fairest of stars last in the train of night 
1	if better thou belong not to the dawn 
1	sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn
1	with thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere 
1	while day arises that sweet hour of prime 
1	thou sun of this great world both eye and soul 
1	acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise
1	in thy eternal course both when thou climbest 
1	and when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest 
1	moon that now meetest the orient sun now flyest 
1	with the fixed stars fixed in their orb that flies 
1	and ye five other wandering fires that move
1	in mystick dance not without song resound
1	his praise who out of darkness called up light 
1	air and ye elements the eldest birth
1	of nature s womb that in quaternion run
1	perpetual circle multiform and mix
1	and nourish all things let your ceaseless change
1	vary to our great maker still new praise 
1	ye mists and exhalations that now rise
1	from hill or steaming lake dusky or gray 
1	till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold 
1	in honour to the world s great author rise 
1	whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky 
1	or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers 
1	rising or falling still advance his praise 
1	his praise ye winds that from four quarters blow 
1	breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye pines 
1	with every plant in sign of worship wave 
1	fountains and ye that warble as ye flow 
1	melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise 
1	join voices all ye living souls ye birds 
1	that singing up to heaven gate ascend 
1	bear on your wings and in your notes his praise 
1	ye that in waters glide and ye that walk
1	the earth and stately tread or lowly creep 
1	witness if i be silent morn or even 
1	to hill or valley fountain or fresh shade 
1	made vocal by my song and taught his praise 
1	hail universal lord be bounteous still
1	to give us only good and if the night
1	have gathered aught of evil or concealed 
1	disperse it as now light dispels the dark 
1	so prayed they innocent and to their thoughts
1	firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm 
1	on to their morning s rural work they haste 
1	among sweet dews and flowers where any row
1	of fruit trees over woody reached too far
1	their pampered boughs and needed hands to check
1	fruitless embraces or they led the vine
1	to wed her elm she spoused about him twines
1	her marriageable arms and with him brings
1	her dower the adopted clusters to adorn
1	his barren leaves them thus employed beheld
1	with pity heaven s high king and to him called
1	raphael the sociable spirit that deigned
1	to travel with tobias and secured
1	his marriage with the seventimes wedded maid 
1	raphael said he thou hearest what stir on earth
1	satan from hell scaped through the darksome gulf 
1	hath raised in paradise and how disturbed
1	this night the human pair how he designs
1	in them at once to ruin all mankind 
1	go therefore half this day as friend with friend
1	converse with adam in what bower or shade
1	thou findest him from the heat of noon retired 
1	to respite his day labour with repast 
1	or with repose and such discourse bring on 
1	as may advise him of his happy state 
1	happiness in his power left free to will 
1	left to his own free will his will though free 
1	yet mutable whence warn him to beware
1	he swerve not too secure tell him withal
1	his danger and from whom what enemy 
1	late fallen himself from heaven is plotting now
1	the fall of others from like state of bliss 
1	by violence no for that shall be withstood 
1	but by deceit and lies this let him know 
1	lest wilfully transgressing he pretend
1	surprisal unadmonished unforewarned 
1	so spake the eternal father and fulfilled
1	all justice nor delayed the winged saint
1	after his charge received but from among
1	thousand celestial ardours where he stood
1	veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light 
1	flew through the midst of heaven the angelick quires 
1	on each hand parting to his speed gave way
1	through all the empyreal road till at the gate
1	of heaven arrived the gate self opened wide
1	on golden hinges turning as by work
1	divine the sovran architect had framed 
1	from hence no cloud or to obstruct his sight 
1	star interposed however small he sees 
1	not unconformed to other shining globes 
1	earth and the garden of god with cedars crowned
1	above all hills as when by night the glass
1	of galileo less assured observes
1	imagined lands and regions in the moon 
1	or pilot from amidst the cyclades
1	delos or samos first appearing kens
1	a cloudy spot down thither prone in flight
1	he speeds and through the vast ethereal sky
1	sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing
1	now on the polar winds then with quick fan
1	winnows the buxom air till within soar
1	of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems
1	a phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird 
1	when to enshrine his reliques in the sun s
1	at once on the eastern cliff of paradise
1	he lights and to his proper shape returns
1	a seraph winged six wings he wore to shade
1	his lineaments divine the pair that clad
1	each shoulder broad came mantling o er his breast
1	with regal ornament the middle pair
1	girt like a starry zone his waist and round
1	skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold
1	and colours dipt in heaven the third his feet
1	shadowed from either heel with feathered mail 
1	sky tinctured grain like maia s son he stood 
1	and shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled
1	the circuit wide straight knew him all the bands
1	of angels under watch and to his state 
1	and to his message high in honour rise 
1	for on some message high they guessed him bound 
1	their glittering tents he passed and now is come
1	into the blissful field through groves of myrrh 
1	and flowering odours cassia nard and balm 
1	a wilderness of sweets for nature here
1	wantoned as in her prime and played at will
1	her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet 
1	wild above rule or art enormous bliss 
1	him through the spicy forest onward come
1	adam discerned as in the door he sat
1	of his cool bower while now the mounted sun
1	shot down direct his fervid rays to warm
1	earth s inmost womb more warmth than adam needs 
1	and eve within due at her hour prepared
1	for dinner savoury fruits of taste to please
1	true appetite and not disrelish thirst
1	of nectarous draughts between from milky stream 
1	berry or grape to whom thus adam called 
1	haste hither eve and worth thy sight behold
1	eastward among those trees what glorious shape
1	comes this way moving seems another morn
1	risen on mid noon some great behest from heaven
1	to us perhaps he brings and will vouchsafe
1	this day to be our guest but go with speed 
1	and what thy stores contain bring forth and pour
1	abundance fit to honour and receive
1	our heavenly stranger well we may afford
1	our givers their own gifts and large bestow
1	from large bestowed where nature multiplies
1	her fertile growth and by disburthening grows
1	more fruitful which instructs us not to spare 
1	to whom thus eve adam earth s hallowed mould 
1	of god inspired small store will serve where store 
1	all seasons ripe for use hangs on the stalk 
1	save what by frugal storing firmness gains
1	to nourish and superfluous moist consumes 
1	but i will haste and from each bough and brake 
1	each plant and juciest gourd will pluck such choice
1	to entertain our angel guest as he
1	beholding shall confess that here on earth
1	god hath dispensed his bounties as in heaven 
1	so saying with dispatchful looks in haste
1	she turns on hospitable thoughts intent
1	what choice to choose for delicacy best 
1	what order so contrived as not to mix
1	tastes not well joined inelegant but bring
1	taste after taste upheld with kindliest change 
1	bestirs her then and from each tender stalk
1	whatever earth all bearing mother yields
1	in india east or west or middle shore
1	in pontus or the punick coast or where
1	alcinous reigned fruit of all kinds in coat
1	rough or smooth rind or bearded husk or shell 
1	she gathers tribute large and on the board
1	heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape
1	she crushes inoffensive must and meaths
1	from many a berry and from sweet kernels pressed
1	she tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold
1	wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground
1	with rose and odours from the shrub unfumed 
1	mean while our primitive great sire to meet
1	his god like guest walks forth without more train
1	accompanied than with his own complete
1	perfections in himself was all his state 
1	more solemn than the tedious pomp that waits
1	on princes when their rich retinue long
1	of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold 
1	dazzles the croud and sets them all agape 
1	nearer his presence adam though not awed 
1	yet with submiss approach and reverence meek 
1	as to a superiour nature bowing low 
1	thus said native of heaven for other place
1	none can than heaven such glorious shape contain 
1	since by descending from the thrones above 
1	those happy places thou hast deigned a while
1	to want and honour these vouchsafe with us
1	two only who yet by sovran gift possess
1	this spacious ground in yonder shady bower
1	to rest and what the garden choicest bears
1	to sit and taste till this meridian heat
1	be over and the sun more cool decline 
1	whom thus the angelick virtue answered mild 
1	adam i therefore came nor art thou such
1	created or such place hast here to dwell 
1	as may not oft invite though spirits of heaven 
1	to visit thee lead on then where thy bower
1	o ershades for these mid hours till evening rise 
1	i have at will so to the sylvan lodge
1	they came that like pomona s arbour smiled 
1	with flowerets decked and fragrant smells but eve 
1	undecked save with herself more lovely fair
1	than wood nymph or the fairest goddess feigned
1	of three that in mount ida naked strove 
1	stood to entertain her guest from heaven no veil
1	she needed virtue proof no thought infirm
1	altered her cheek on whom the angel hail
1	bestowed the holy salutation used
1	long after to blest mary second eve 
1	hail mother of mankind whose fruitful womb
1	shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons 
1	than with these various fruits the trees of god
1	have heaped this table raised of grassy turf
1	their table was and mossy seats had round 
1	and on her ample square from side to side
1	all autumn piled though spring and autumn here
1	danced hand in hand a while discourse they hold 
1	no fear lest dinner cool when thus began
1	our author heavenly stranger please to taste
1	these bounties which our nourisher from whom
1	all perfect good unmeasured out descends 
1	to us for food and for delight hath caused
1	the earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps
1	to spiritual natures only this i know 
1	that one celestial father gives to all 
1	to whom the angel therefore what he gives
1	 whose praise be ever sung to man in part
1	spiritual may of purest spirits be found
1	no ingrateful food and food alike those pure
1	intelligential substances require 
1	as doth your rational and both contain
1	within them every lower faculty
1	of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste 
1	tasting concoct digest assimilate 
1	and corporeal to incorporeal turn 
1	for know whatever was created needs
1	to be sustained and fed of elements
1	the grosser feeds the purer earth the sea 
1	earth and the sea feed air the air those fires
1	ethereal and as lowest first the moon 
1	whence in her visage round those spots unpurged
1	vapours not yet into her substance turned 
1	nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale
1	from her moist continent to higher orbs 
1	the sun that light imparts to all receives
1	from all his alimental recompence
1	in humid exhalations and at even
1	sups with the ocean though in heaven the trees
1	of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines
1	yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn
1	we brush mellifluous dews and find the ground
1	covered with pearly grain yet god hath here
1	varied his bounty so with new delights 
1	as may compare with heaven and to taste
1	think not i shall be nice so down they sat 
1	and to their viands fell nor seemingly
1	the angel nor in mist the common gloss
1	of theologians but with keen dispatch
1	of real hunger and concoctive heat
1	to transubstantiate what redounds transpires
1	through spirits with ease nor wonder if by fire
1	of sooty coal the empirick alchemist
1	can turn or holds it possible to turn 
1	metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold 
1	as from the mine mean while at table eve
1	ministered naked and their flowing cups
1	with pleasant liquours crowned o innocence
1	deserving paradise if ever then 
1	then had the sons of god excuse to have been
1	enamoured at that sight but in those hearts
1	love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy
1	was understood the injured lover s hell 
1	thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed 
1	not burdened nature sudden mind arose
1	in adam not to let the occasion pass
1	given him by this great conference to know
1	of things above his world and of their being
1	who dwell in heaven whose excellence he saw
1	transcend his own so far whose radiant forms 
1	divine effulgence whose high power so far
1	exceeded human and his wary speech
1	thus to the empyreal minister he framed 
1	inhabitant with god now know i well
1	thy favour in this honour done to man 
1	under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed
1	to enter and these earthly fruits to taste 
1	food not of angels yet accepted so 
1	as that more willingly thou couldst not seem
1	at heaven s high feasts to have fed yet what compare
1	to whom the winged hierarch replied 
1	o adam one almighty is from whom
1	all things proceed and up to him return 
1	if not depraved from good created all
1	such to perfection one first matter all 
1	endued with various forms various degrees
1	of substance and in things that live of life 
1	but more refined more spiritous and pure 
1	as nearer to him placed or nearer tending
1	each in their several active spheres assigned 
1	till body up to spirit work in bounds
1	proportioned to each kind so from the root
1	springs lighter the green stalk from thence the leaves
1	more aery last the bright consummate flower
1	spirits odorous breathes flowers and their fruit 
1	man s nourishment by gradual scale sublimed 
1	to vital spirits aspire to animal 
1	to intellectual give both life and sense 
1	fancy and understanding whence the soul
1	reason receives and reason is her being 
1	discursive or intuitive discourse
1	is oftest yours the latter most is ours 
1	differing but in degree of kind the same 
1	wonder not then what god for you saw good
1	if i refuse not but convert as you
1	to proper substance time may come when men
1	with angels may participate and find
1	no inconvenient diet nor too light fare 
1	and from these corporal nutriments perhaps
1	your bodies may at last turn all to spirit 
1	improved by tract of time and winged ascend
1	ethereal as we or may at choice 
1	here or in heavenly paradises dwell 
1	if ye be found obedient and retain
1	unalterably firm his love entire 
1	whose progeny you are mean while enjoy
1	your fill what happiness this happy state
1	can comprehend incapable of more 
1	to whom the patriarch of mankind replied 
1	o favourable spirit propitious guest 
1	well hast thou taught the way that might direct
1	our knowledge and the scale of nature set
1	from center to circumference whereon 
1	in contemplation of created things 
1	by steps we may ascend to god but say 
1	what meant that caution joined if ye be found
1	obedient can we want obedience then
1	to him or possibly his love desert 
1	who formed us from the dust and placed us here
1	full to the utmost measure of what bliss
1	human desires can seek or apprehend 
1	to whom the angel son of heaven and earth 
1	attend that thou art happy owe to god 
1	that thou continuest such owe to thyself 
1	that is to thy obedience therein stand 
1	this was that caution given thee be advised 
1	god made thee perfect not immutable 
1	and good he made thee but to persevere
1	he left it in thy power ordained thy will
1	by nature free not over ruled by fate
1	inextricable or strict necessity 
1	our voluntary service he requires 
1	not our necessitated such with him
1	finds no acceptance nor can find for how
1	can hearts not free be tried whether they serve
1	willing or no who will but what they must
1	by destiny and can no other choose 
1	myself and all the angelick host that stand
1	in sight of god enthroned our happy state
1	hold as you yours while our obedience holds 
1	on other surety none freely we serve 
1	because we freely love as in our will
1	to love or not in this we stand or fall 
1	and some are fallen to disobedience fallen 
1	and so from heaven to deepest hell o fall
1	from what high state of bliss into what woe 
1	to whom our great progenitor thy words
1	attentive and with more delighted ear 
1	divine instructer i have heard than when
1	cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills
1	aereal musick send nor knew i not
1	to be both will and deed created free 
1	yet that we never shall forget to love
1	our maker and obey him whose command
1	single is yet so just my constant thoughts
1	assured me and still assure though what thou tellest
1	hath passed in heaven some doubt within me move 
1	but more desire to hear if thou consent 
1	the full relation which must needs be strange 
1	worthy of sacred silence to be heard 
1	and we have yet large day for scarce the sun
1	hath finished half his journey and scarce begins
1	his other half in the great zone of heaven 
1	thus adam made request and raphael 
1	after short pause assenting thus began 
1	high matter thou enjoinest me o prime of men 
1	sad task and hard for how shall i relate
1	to human sense the invisible exploits
1	of warring spirits how without remorse 
1	the ruin of so many glorious once
1	and perfect while they stood how last unfold
1	the secrets of another world perhaps
1	not lawful to reveal yet for thy good
1	this is dispensed and what surmounts the reach
1	of human sense i shall delineate so 
1	by likening spiritual to corporal forms 
1	as may express them best though what if earth
1	be but a shadow of heaven and things therein
1	each to other like more than on earth is thought 
1	as yet this world was not and chaos wild
1	reigned where these heavens now roll where earth now rests
1	upon her center poised when on a day
1	 for time though in eternity applied
1	to motion measures all things durable
1	by present past and future on such day
1	as heaven s great year brings forth the empyreal host
1	of angels by imperial summons called 
1	innumerable before the almighty s throne
1	forthwith from all the ends of heaven appeared
1	under their hierarchs in orders bright 
1	ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced 
1	standards and gonfalons twixt van and rear
1	stream in the air and for distinction serve
1	of hierarchies of orders and degrees 
1	or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed
1	holy memorials acts of zeal and love
1	recorded eminent thus when in orbs
1	of circuit inexpressible they stood 
1	orb within orb the father infinite 
1	by whom in bliss imbosomed sat the son 
1	amidst as from a flaming mount whose top
1	brightness had made invisible thus spake 
1	hear all ye angels progeny of light 
1	hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand 
1	this day i have begot whom i declare
1	my only son and on this holy hill
1	him have anointed whom ye now behold
1	at my right hand your head i him appoint 
1	and by myself have sworn to him shall bow
1	all knees in heaven and shall confess him lord 
1	under his great vice gerent reign abide
1	united as one individual soul 
1	for ever happy him who disobeys 
1	me disobeys breaks union and that day 
1	cast out from god and blessed vision falls
1	into utter darkness deep ingulfed his place
1	ordained without redemption without end 
1	so spake the omnipotent and with his words
1	all seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all 
1	that day as other solemn days they spent
1	in song and dance about the sacred hill 
1	mystical dance which yonder starry sphere
1	of planets and of fixed in all her wheels
1	resembles nearest mazes intricate 
1	eccentrick intervolved yet regular
1	then most when most irregular they seem 
1	and in their motions harmony divine
1	so smooths her charming tones that god s own ear
1	listens delighted evening now approached 
1	 for we have also our evening and our morn 
1	we ours for change delectable not need 
1	forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
1	desirous all in circles as they stood 
1	tables are set and on a sudden piled
1	with angels food and rubied nectar flows
1	in pearl in diamond and massy gold 
1	fruit of delicious vines the growth of heaven 
1	on flowers reposed and with fresh flowerets crowned 
1	they eat they drink and in communion sweet
1	quaff immortality and joy secure
1	of surfeit where full measure only bounds
1	excess before the all bounteous king who showered
1	with copious hand rejoicing in their joy 
1	now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled
1	from that high mount of god whence light and shade
1	spring both the face of brightest heaven had changed
1	to grateful twilight for night comes not there
1	in darker veil and roseate dews disposed
1	all but the unsleeping eyes of god to rest 
1	wide over all the plain and wider far
1	than all this globous earth in plain outspread 
1	 such are the courts of god the angelick throng 
1	dispersed in bands and files their camp extend
1	by living streams among the trees of life 
1	pavilions numberless and sudden reared 
1	celestial tabernacles where they slept
1	fanned with cool winds save those who in their course 
1	melodious hymns about the sovran throne
1	alternate all night long but not so waked
1	satan so call him now his former name
1	is heard no more in heaven he of the first 
1	if not the first arch angel great in power 
1	in favour and pre eminence yet fraught
1	with envy against the son of god that day
1	honoured by his great father and proclaimed
1	messiah king anointed could not bear
1	through pride that sight and thought himself impaired 
1	deep malice thence conceiving and disdain 
1	soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour
1	friendliest to sleep and silence he resolved
1	with all his legions to dislodge and leave
1	unworshipt unobeyed the throne supreme 
1	contemptuous and his next subordinate
1	awakening thus to him in secret spake 
1	sleepest thou companion dear what sleep can close
1	thy eye lids and rememberest what decree
1	of yesterday so late hath passed the lips
1	of heaven s almighty thou to me thy thoughts
1	wast wont i mine to thee was wont to impart 
1	both waking we were one how then can now
1	thy sleep dissent new laws thou seest imposed 
1	new laws from him who reigns new minds may raise
1	in us who serve new counsels to debate
1	what doubtful may ensue more in this place
1	to utter is not safe assemble thou
1	of all those myriads which we lead the chief 
1	tell them that by command ere yet dim night
1	her shadowy cloud withdraws i am to haste 
1	and all who under me their banners wave 
1	homeward with flying march where we possess
1	the quarters of the north there to prepare
1	fit entertainment to receive our king 
1	the great messiah and his new commands 
1	who speedily through all the hierarchies
1	intends to pass triumphant and give laws 
1	so spake the false arch angel and infused
1	bad influence into the unwary breast
1	of his associate he together calls 
1	or several one by one the regent powers 
1	under him regent tells as he was taught 
1	that the most high commanding now ere night 
1	now ere dim night had disincumbered heaven 
1	the great hierarchal standard was to move 
1	tells the suggested cause and casts between
1	ambiguous words and jealousies to sound
1	or taint integrity but all obeyed
1	the wonted signal and superiour voice
1	of their great potentate for great indeed
1	his name and high was his degree in heaven 
1	his countenance as the morning star that guides
1	the starry flock allured them and with lies
1	drew after him the third part of heaven s host 
1	mean while the eternal eye whose sight discerns
1	abstrusest thoughts from forth his holy mount 
1	and from within the golden lamps that burn
1	nightly before him saw without their light
1	rebellion rising saw in whom how spread
1	among the sons of morn what multitudes
1	were banded to oppose his high decree 
1	and smiling to his only son thus said 
1	son thou in whom my glory i behold
1	in full resplendence heir of all my might 
1	nearly it now concerns us to be sure
1	of our omnipotence and with what arms
1	we mean to hold what anciently we claim
1	of deity or empire such a foe
1	is rising who intends to erect his throne
1	equal to ours throughout the spacious north 
1	nor so content hath in his thought to try
1	in battle what our power is or our right 
1	let us advise and to this hazard draw
1	with speed what force is left and all employ
1	in our defence lest unawares we lose
1	this our high place our sanctuary our hill 
1	to whom the son with calm aspect and clear 
1	lightning divine ineffable serene 
1	made answer mighty father thou thy foes
1	justly hast in derision and secure 
1	laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain 
1	matter to me of glory whom their hate
1	illustrates when they see all regal power
1	given me to quell their pride and in event
1	know whether i be dextrous to subdue
1	thy rebels or be found the worst in heaven 
1	so spake the son but satan with his powers 
1	far was advanced on winged speed an host
1	innumerable as the stars of night 
1	or stars of morning dew drops which the sun
1	impearls on every leaf and every flower 
1	regions they passed the mighty regencies
1	in their triple degrees regions to which
1	all thy dominion adam is no more
1	than what this garden is to all the earth 
1	and all the sea from one entire globose
1	stretched into longitude which having passed 
1	at length into the limits of the north
1	they came and satan to his royal seat
1	high on a hill far blazing as a mount
1	raised on a mount with pyramids and towers
1	from diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold 
1	the palace of great lucifer so call
1	that structure in the dialect of men
1	interpreted which not long after he
1	affecting all equality with god 
1	in imitation of that mount whereon
1	messiah was declared in sight of heaven 
1	the mountain of the congregation called 
1	for thither he assembled all his train 
1	pretending so commanded to consult
1	about the great reception of their king 
1	thither to come and with calumnious art
1	of counterfeited truth thus held their ears 
1	if these magnifick titles yet remain
1	not merely titular since by decree
1	another now hath to himself engrossed
1	all power and us eclipsed under the name
1	of king anointed for whom all this haste
1	of midnight march and hurried meeting here 
1	this only to consult how we may best 
1	with what may be devised of honours new 
1	receive him coming to receive from us
1	knee tribute yet unpaid prostration vile 
1	too much to one but double how endured 
1	to one and to his image now proclaimed 
1	but what if better counsels might erect
1	our minds and teach us to cast off this yoke 
1	will ye submit your necks and choose to bend
1	the supple knee ye will not if i trust
1	to know ye right or if ye know yourselves
1	natives and sons of heaven possessed before
1	by none and if not equal all yet free 
1	equally free for orders and degrees
1	jar not with liberty but well consist 
1	who can in reason then or right assume
1	monarchy over such as live by right
1	his equals if in power and splendour less 
1	in freedom equal or can introduce
1	law and edict on us who without law
1	err not much less for this to be our lord 
1	and look for adoration to the abuse
1	of those imperial titles which assert
1	our being ordained to govern not to serve 
1	thus far his bold discourse without controul
1	had audience when among the seraphim
1	abdiel than whom none with more zeal adored
1	the deity and divine commands obeyed 
1	stood up and in a flame of zeal severe
1	the current of his fury thus opposed 
1	o argument blasphemous false and proud 
1	words which no ear ever to hear in heaven
1	expected least of all from thee ingrate 
1	in place thyself so high above thy peers 
1	canst thou with impious obloquy condemn
1	the just decree of god pronounced and sworn 
1	that to his only son by right endued
1	with regal scepter every soul in heaven
1	shall bend the knee and in that honour due
1	confess him rightful king unjust thou sayest 
1	flatly unjust to bind with laws the free 
1	and equal over equals to let reign 
1	one over all with unsucceeded power 
1	shalt thou give law to god shalt thou dispute
1	with him the points of liberty who made
1	thee what thou art and formed the powers of heaven
1	such as he pleased and circumscribed their being 
1	yet by experience taught we know how good 
1	and of our good and of our dignity
1	how provident he is how far from thought
1	to make us less bent rather to exalt
1	our happy state under one head more near
1	united but to grant it thee unjust 
1	that equal over equals monarch reign 
1	thyself though great and glorious dost thou count 
1	or all angelick nature joined in one 
1	equal to him begotten son by whom 
1	as by his word the mighty father made
1	all things even thee and all the spirits of heaven
1	by him created in their bright degrees 
1	crowned them with glory and to their glory named
1	essential powers nor by his reign obscured 
1	but more illustrious made since he the head
1	one of our number thus reduced becomes 
1	his laws our laws all honour to him done
1	returns our own cease then this impious rage 
1	and tempt not these but hasten to appease
1	the incensed father and the incensed son 
1	while pardon may be found in time besought 
1	so spake the fervent angel but his zeal
1	none seconded as out of season judged 
1	or singular and rash whereat rejoiced
1	the apostate and more haughty thus replied 
1	that we were formed then sayest thou and the work
1	of secondary hands by task transferred
1	from father to his son strange point and new 
1	doctrine which we would know whence learned who saw
1	when this creation was rememberest thou
1	thy making while the maker gave thee being 
1	we know no time when we were not as now 
1	know none before us self begot self raised
1	by our own quickening power when fatal course
1	had circled his full orb the birth mature
1	of this our native heaven ethereal sons 
1	our puissance is our own our own right hand
1	shall teach us highest deeds by proof to try
1	who is our equal then thou shalt behold
1	whether by supplication we intend
1	address and to begirt the almighty throne
1	beseeching or besieging this report 
1	these tidings carry to the anointed king 
1	and fly ere evil intercept thy flight 
1	he said and as the sound of waters deep 
1	hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause
1	through the infinite host nor less for that
1	the flaming seraph fearless though alone
1	encompassed round with foes thus answered bold 
1	o alienate from god o spirit accursed 
1	forsaken of all good i see thy fall
1	determined and thy hapless crew involved
1	in this perfidious fraud contagion spread
1	both of thy crime and punishment henceforth
1	no more be troubled how to quit the yoke
1	of god s messiah those indulgent laws
1	will not be now vouchsafed other decrees
1	against thee are gone forth without recall 
1	that golden scepter which thou didst reject 
1	is now an iron rod to bruise and break
1	thy disobedience well thou didst advise 
1	yet not for thy advice or threats i fly
1	these wicked tents devoted lest the wrath
1	impendent raging into sudden flame 
1	distinguish not for soon expect to feel
1	his thunder on thy head devouring fire 
1	then who created thee lamenting learn 
1	when who can uncreate thee thou shalt know 
1	so spake the seraph abdiel faithful found
1	among the faithless faithful only he 
1	among innumerable false unmoved 
1	unshaken unseduced unterrified 
1	his loyalty he kept his love his zeal 
1	nor number nor example with him wrought
1	to swerve from truth or change his constant mind 
1	though single from amidst them forth he passed 
1	long way through hostile scorn which he sustained
1	superiour nor of violence feared aught 
1	and with retorted scorn his back he turned
1	on those proud towers to swift destruction doomed 
1	all night the dreadless angel unpursued 
1	through heaven s wide champain held his way till morn 
1	waked by the circling hours with rosy hand
1	unbarred the gates of light there is a cave
1	within the mount of god fast by his throne 
1	where light and darkness in perpetual round
1	lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through heaven
1	grateful vicissitude like day and night 
1	light issues forth and at the other door
1	obsequious darkness enters till her hour
1	to veil the heaven though darkness there might well
1	seem twilight here and now went forth the morn
1	such as in highest heaven arrayed in gold
1	empyreal from before her vanished night 
1	shot through with orient beams when all the plain
1	covered with thick embattled squadrons bright 
1	chariots and flaming arms and fiery steeds 
1	reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view 
1	war he perceived war in procinct and found
1	already known what he for news had thought
1	to have reported gladly then he mixed
1	among those friendly powers who him received
1	with joy and acclamations loud that one 
1	that of so many myriads fallen yet one
1	returned not lost on to the sacred hill
1	they led him high applauded and present
1	before the seat supreme from whence a voice 
1	from midst a golden cloud thus mild was heard 
1	servant of god well done well hast thou fought
1	the better fight who single hast maintained
1	against revolted multitudes the cause
1	of truth in word mightier than they in arms 
1	and for the testimony of truth hast borne
1	universal reproach far worse to bear
1	than violence for this was all thy care
1	to stand approved in sight of god though worlds
1	judged thee perverse the easier conquest now
1	remains thee aided by this host of friends 
1	back on thy foes more glorious to return 
1	than scorned thou didst depart and to subdue
1	by force who reason for their law refuse 
1	right reason for their law and for their king
1	messiah who by right of merit reigns 
1	go michael of celestial armies prince 
1	and thou in military prowess next 
1	gabriel lead forth to battle these my sons
1	invincible lead forth my armed saints 
1	by thousands and by millions ranged for fight 
1	equal in number to that godless crew
1	rebellious them with fire and hostile arms
1	fearless assault and to the brow of heaven
1	pursuing drive them out from god and bliss 
1	into their place of punishment the gulf
1	of tartarus which ready opens wide
1	his fiery chaos to receive their fall 
1	so spake the sovran voice and clouds began
1	to darken all the hill and smoke to roll
1	in dusky wreaths reluctant flames the sign
1	of wrath awaked nor with less dread the loud
1	ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow 
1	at which command the powers militant 
1	that stood for heaven in mighty quadrate joined
1	of union irresistible moved on
1	in silence their bright legions to the sound
1	of instrumental harmony that breathed
1	heroick ardour to adventurous deeds
1	under their god like leaders in the cause
1	of god and his messiah on they move
1	indissolubly firm nor obvious hill 
1	nor straitening vale nor wood nor stream divides
1	their perfect ranks for high above the ground
1	their march was and the passive air upbore
1	their nimble tread as when the total kind
1	of birds in orderly array on wing 
1	came summoned over eden to receive
1	their names of thee so over many a tract
1	of heaven they marched and many a province wide 
1	tenfold the length of this terrene at last 
1	far in the horizon to the north appeared
1	from skirt to skirt a fiery region stretched
1	in battailous aspect and nearer view
1	bristled with upright beams innumerable
1	of rigid spears and helmets thronged and shields
1	various with boastful argument portrayed 
1	the banded powers of satan hasting on
1	with furious expedition for they weened
1	that self same day by fight or by surprise 
1	to win the mount of god and on his throne
1	to set the envier of his state the proud
1	aspirer but their thoughts proved fond and vain
1	in the mid way though strange to us it seemed
1	at first that angel should with angel war 
1	and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet
1	so oft in festivals of joy and love
1	unanimous as sons of one great sire 
1	hymning the eternal father but the shout
1	of battle now began and rushing sound
1	of onset ended soon each milder thought 
1	high in the midst exalted as a god 
1	the apostate in his sun bright chariot sat 
1	idol of majesty divine enclosed
1	with flaming cherubim and golden shields 
1	then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now
1	 twixt host and host but narrow space was left 
1	a dreadful interval and front to front
1	presented stood in terrible array
1	of hideous length before the cloudy van 
1	on the rough edge of battle ere it joined 
1	satan with vast and haughty strides advanced 
1	came towering armed in adamant and gold 
1	abdiel that sight endured not where he stood
1	among the mightiest bent on highest deeds 
1	and thus his own undaunted heart explores 
1	o heaven that such resemblance of the highest
1	should yet remain where faith and realty
1	remain not wherefore should not strength and might
1	there fail where virtue fails or weakest prove
1	where boldest though to fight unconquerable 
1	his puissance trusting in the almighty s aid 
1	i mean to try whose reason i have tried
1	unsound and false nor is it aught but just 
1	that he who in debate of truth hath won 
1	should win in arms in both disputes alike
1	victor though brutish that contest and foul 
1	when reason hath to deal with force yet so
1	most reason is that reason overcome 
1	so pondering and from his armed peers
1	forth stepping opposite half way he met
1	his daring foe at this prevention more
1	incensed and thus securely him defied 
1	proud art thou met thy hope was to have reached
1	the highth of thy aspiring unopposed 
1	the throne of god unguarded and his side
1	abandoned at the terrour of thy power
1	or potent tongue fool not to think how vain
1	against the omnipotent to rise in arms 
1	who out of smallest things could without end 
1	have raised incessant armies to defeat
1	thy folly or with solitary hand
1	reaching beyond all limit at one blow 
1	unaided could have finished thee and whelmed
1	thy legions under darkness but thou seest
1	all are not of thy train there be who faith
1	prefer and piety to god though then
1	to thee not visible when i alone
1	seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent
1	from all my sect thou seest now learn too late
1	how few sometimes may know when thousands err 
1	whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance 
1	thus answered ill for thee but in wished hour
1	of my revenge first sought for thou returnest
1	from flight seditious angel to receive
1	thy merited reward the first assay
1	of this right hand provoked since first that tongue 
1	inspired with contradiction durst oppose
1	a third part of the gods in synod met
1	their deities to assert who while they feel
1	vigour divine within them can allow
1	omnipotence to none but well thou comest
1	before thy fellows ambitious to win
1	from me some plume that thy success may show
1	destruction to the rest this pause between 
1	 unanswered lest thou boast to let thee know 
1	at first i thought that liberty and heaven
1	to heavenly souls had been all one but now
1	i see that most through sloth had rather serve 
1	ministring spirits trained up in feast and song 
1	such hast thou armed the minstrelsy of heaven 
1	servility with freedom to contend 
1	as both their deeds compared this day shall prove 
1	to whom in brief thus abdiel stern replied 
1	apostate still thou errest nor end wilt find
1	of erring from the path of truth remote 
1	unjustly thou depravest it with the name
1	of servitude to serve whom god ordains 
1	or nature god and nature bid the same 
1	when he who rules is worthiest and excels
1	them whom he governs this is servitude 
1	to serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled
1	against his worthier as thine now serve thee 
1	thyself not free but to thyself enthralled 
1	yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid 
1	reign thou in hell thy kingdom let me serve
1	in heaven god ever blest and his divine
1	behests obey worthiest to be obeyed 
1	yet chains in hell not realms expect mean while
1	from me returned as erst thou saidst from flight 
1	this greeting on thy impious crest receive 
1	so saying a noble stroke he lifted high 
1	which hung not but so swift with tempest fell
1	on the proud crest of satan that no sight 
1	nor motion of swift thought less could his shield 
1	such ruin intercept ten paces huge
1	he back recoiled the tenth on bended knee
1	his massy spear upstaid as if on earth
1	winds under ground or waters forcing way 
1	sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat 
1	half sunk with all his pines amazement seised
1	the rebel thrones but greater rage to see
1	thus foiled their mightiest ours joy filled and shout 
1	presage of victory and fierce desire
1	of battle whereat michael bid sound
1	the arch angel trumpet through the vast of heaven
1	it sounded and the faithful armies rung
1	hosanna to the highest nor stood at gaze
1	the adverse legions nor less hideous joined
1	the horrid shock now storming fury rose 
1	and clamour such as heard in heaven till now
1	was never arms on armour clashing brayed
1	horrible discord and the madding wheels
1	of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise
1	of conflict over head the dismal hiss
1	of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew 
1	and flying vaulted either host with fire 
1	so under fiery cope together rushed
1	both battles main with ruinous assault
1	and inextinguishable rage all heaven
1	resounded and had earth been then all earth
1	had to her center shook what wonder when
1	millions of fierce encountering angels fought
1	on either side the least of whom could wield
1	these elements and arm him with the force
1	of all their regions how much more of power
1	army against army numberless to raise
1	dreadful combustion warring and disturb 
1	though not destroy their happy native seat 
1	from his strong hold of heaven high over ruled
1	and limited their might though numbered such
1	as each divided legion might have seemed
1	a numerous host in strength each armed hand
1	a legion led in fight yet leader seemed
1	each warriour single as in chief expert
1	when to advance or stand or turn the sway
1	of battle open when and when to close
1	the ridges of grim war no thought of flight 
1	none of retreat no unbecoming deed
1	that argued fear each on himself relied 
1	as only in his arm the moment lay
1	of victory deeds of eternal fame
1	were done but infinite for wide was spread
1	that war and various sometimes on firm ground
1	a standing fight then soaring on main wing 
1	tormented all the air all air seemed then
1	conflicting fire long time in even scale
1	the battle hung till satan who that day
1	prodigious power had shown and met in arms
1	no equal ranging through the dire attack
1	of fighting seraphim confused at length
1	saw where the sword of michael smote and felled
1	squadrons at once with huge two handed sway
1	brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
1	wide wasting such destruction to withstand
1	he hasted and opposed the rocky orb
1	of tenfold adamant his ample shield 
1	a vast circumference at his approach
1	the great arch angel from his warlike toil
1	surceased and glad as hoping here to end
1	intestine war in heaven the arch foe subdued
1	or captive dragged in chains with hostile frown
1	and visage all inflamed first thus began 
1	author of evil unknown till thy revolt 
1	unnamed in heaven now plenteous as thou seest
1	these acts of hateful strife hateful to all 
1	though heaviest by just measure on thyself 
1	and thy adherents how hast thou disturbed
1	heaven s blessed peace and into nature brought
1	misery uncreated till the crime
1	of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled
1	thy malice into thousands once upright
1	and faithful now proved false but think not here
1	to trouble holy rest heaven casts thee out
1	from all her confines heaven the seat of bliss 
1	brooks not the works of violence and war 
1	hence then and evil go with thee along 
1	thy offspring to the place of evil hell 
1	thou and thy wicked crew there mingle broils 
1	ere this avenging sword begin thy doom 
1	or some more sudden vengeance winged from god 
1	precipitate thee with augmented pain 
1	so spake the prince of angels to whom thus
1	the adversary nor think thou with wind
1	of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds
1	thou canst not hast thou turned the least of these
1	to flight or if to fall but that they rise
1	unvanquished easier to transact with me
1	that thou shouldst hope imperious and with threats
1	to chase me hence err not that so shall end
1	the strife which thou callest evil but we style
1	the strife of glory which we mean to win 
1	or turn this heaven itself into the hell
1	thou fablest here however to dwell free 
1	if not to reign mean while thy utmost force 
1	and join him named almighty to thy aid 
1	i fly not but have sought thee far and nigh 
1	they ended parle and both addressed for fight
1	unspeakable for who though with the tongue
1	of angels can relate or to what things
1	liken on earth conspicuous that may lift
1	human imagination to such highth
1	of godlike power for likest gods they seemed 
1	stood they or moved in stature motion arms 
1	fit to decide the empire of great heaven 
1	now waved their fiery swords and in the air
1	made horrid circles two broad suns their shields
1	blazed opposite while expectation stood
1	in horrour from each hand with speed retired 
1	where erst was thickest fight the angelick throng 
1	and left large field unsafe within the wind
1	of such commotion such as to set forth
1	great things by small if nature s concord broke 
1	among the constellations war were sprung 
1	two planets rushing from aspect malign
1	of fiercest opposition in mid sky
1	should combat and their jarring spheres confound 
1	together both with next to almighty arm
1	up lifted imminent one stroke they aimed
1	that might determine and not need repeat 
1	as not of power at once nor odds appeared
1	in might or swift prevention but the sword
1	of michael from the armoury of god
1	was given him tempered so that neither keen
1	nor solid might resist that edge it met
1	the sword of satan with steep force to smite
1	descending and in half cut sheer nor staid 
1	but with swift wheel reverse deep entering shared
1	all his right side then satan first knew pain 
1	and writhed him to and fro convolved so sore
1	the griding sword with discontinuous wound
1	passed through him but the ethereal substance closed 
1	not long divisible and from the gash
1	a stream of necturous humour issuing flowed
1	sanguine such as celestial spirits may bleed 
1	and all his armour stained ere while so bright 
1	forthwith on all sides to his aid was run
1	by angels many and strong who interposed
1	defence while others bore him on their shields
1	back to his chariot where it stood retired
1	from off the files of war there they him laid
1	gnashing for anguish and despite and shame 
1	to find himself not matchless and his pride
1	humbled by such rebuke so far beneath
1	his confidence to equal god in power 
1	yet soon he healed for spirits that live throughout
1	vital in every part not as frail man
1	in entrails heart of head liver or reins 
1	cannot but by annihilating die 
1	nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
1	receive no more than can the fluid air 
1	all heart they live all head all eye all ear 
1	all intellect all sense and as they please 
1	they limb themselves and colour shape or size
1	assume as likes them best condense or rare 
1	mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
1	memorial where the might of gabriel fought 
1	and with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array
1	of moloch furious king who him defied 
1	and at his chariot wheels to drag him bound
1	threatened nor from the holy one of heaven
1	refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon
1	down cloven to the waist with shattered arms
1	and uncouth pain fled bellowing on each wing
1	uriel and raphael his vaunting foe 
1	though huge and in a rock of diamond armed 
1	two potent thrones that to be less than gods
1	disdained but meaner thoughts learned in their flight 
1	mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail 
1	nor stood unmindful abdiel to annoy
1	the atheist crew but with redoubled blow
1	ariel and arioch and the violence
1	of ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew 
1	i might relate of thousands and their names
1	eternize here on earth but those elect
1	angels contented with their fame in heaven 
1	seek not the praise of men the other sort 
1	in might though wonderous and in acts of war 
1	nor of renown less eager yet by doom
1	cancelled from heaven and sacred memory 
1	nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell 
1	for strength from truth divided and from just 
1	illaudable nought merits but dispraise
1	and ignominy yet to glory aspires
1	vain glorious and through infamy seeks fame 
1	therefore eternal silence be their doom 
1	and now their mightiest quelled the battle swerved 
1	with many an inroad gored deformed rout
1	entered and foul disorder all the ground
1	with shivered armour strown and on a heap
1	chariot and charioteer lay overturned 
1	and fiery foaming steeds what stood recoiled
1	o er wearied through the faint satanick host
1	defensive scarce or with pale fear surprised 
1	then first with fear surprised and sense of pain 
1	fled ignominious to such evil brought
1	by sin of disobedience till that hour
1	not liable to fear or flight or pain 
1	far otherwise the inviolable saints 
1	in cubick phalanx firm advanced entire 
1	invulnerable impenetrably armed 
1	such high advantages their innocence
1	gave them above their foes not to have sinned 
1	not to have disobeyed in fight they stood
1	unwearied unobnoxious to be pained
1	by wound though from their place by violence moved 
1	now night her course began and over heaven
1	inducing darkness grateful truce imposed 
1	and silence on the odious din of war 
1	under her cloudy covert both retired 
1	victor and vanquished on the foughten field
1	michael and his angels prevalent
1	encamping placed in guard their watches round 
1	cherubick waving fires on the other part 
1	satan with his rebellious disappeared 
1	far in the dark dislodged and void of rest 
1	his potentates to council called by night 
1	and in the midst thus undismayed began 
1	o now in danger tried now known in arms
1	not to be overpowered companions dear 
1	found worthy not of liberty alone 
1	too mean pretence but what we more affect 
1	honour dominion glory and renown 
1	who have sustained one day in doubtful fight 
1	 and if one day why not eternal days 
1	what heaven s lord had powerfullest to send
1	against us from about his throne and judged
1	sufficient to subdue us to his will 
1	but proves not so then fallible it seems 
1	of future we may deem him though till now
1	omniscient thought true is less firmly armed 
1	some disadvantage we endured and pain 
1	till now not known but known as soon contemned 
1	since now we find this our empyreal form
1	incapable of mortal injury 
1	imperishable and though pierced with wound 
1	soon closing and by native vigour healed 
1	of evil then so small as easy think
1	the remedy perhaps more valid arms 
1	weapons more violent when next we meet 
1	may serve to better us and worse our foes 
1	or equal what between us made the odds 
1	in nature none if other hidden cause
1	left them superiour while we can preserve
1	unhurt our minds and understanding sound 
1	due search and consultation will disclose 
1	he sat and in the assembly next upstood
1	nisroch of principalities the prime 
1	as one he stood escaped from cruel fight 
1	sore toiled his riven arms to havock hewn 
1	and cloudy in aspect thus answering spake 
1	deliverer from new lords leader to free
1	enjoyment of our right as gods yet hard
1	for gods and too unequal work we find 
1	against unequal arms to fight in pain 
1	against unpained impassive from which evil
1	ruin must needs ensue for what avails
1	valour or strength though matchless quelled with pain
1	which all subdues and makes remiss the hands
1	of mightiest sense of pleasure we may well
1	spare out of life perhaps and not repine 
1	but live content which is the calmest life 
1	but pain is perfect misery the worst
1	of evils and excessive overturns
1	all patience he who therefore can invent
1	with what more forcible we may offend
1	our yet unwounded enemies or arm
1	ourselves with like defence to me deserves
1	no less than for deliverance what we owe 
1	whereto with look composed satan replied 
1	not uninvented that which thou aright
1	believest so main to our success i bring 
1	which of us who beholds the bright surface
1	of this ethereous mould whereon we stand 
1	this continent of spacious heaven adorned
1	with plant fruit flower ambrosial gems and gold 
1	whose eye so superficially surveys
1	these things as not to mind from whence they grow
1	deep under ground materials dark and crude 
1	of spiritous and fiery spume till touched
1	with heaven s ray and tempered they shoot forth
1	so beauteous opening to the ambient light 
1	these in their dark nativity the deep
1	shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame 
1	which into hollow engines long and round 
1	thick rammed at the other bore with touch of fire
1	dilated and infuriate shall send forth
1	from far with thundering noise among our foes
1	such implements of mischief as shall dash
1	to pieces and o erwhelm whatever stands
1	adverse that they shall fear we have disarmed
1	the thunderer of his only dreaded bolt 
1	nor long shall be our labour yet ere dawn 
1	effect shall end our wish mean while revive 
1	abandon fear to strength and counsel joined
1	think nothing hard much less to be despaired 
1	he ended and his words their drooping cheer
1	enlightened and their languished hope revived 
1	the invention all admired and each how he
1	to be the inventer missed so easy it seemed
1	once found which yet unfound most would have thought
1	impossible yet haply of thy race
1	in future days if malice should abound 
1	some one intent on mischief or inspired
1	with devilish machination might devise
1	like instrument to plague the sons of men
1	for sin on war and mutual slaughter bent 
1	forthwith from council to the work they flew 
1	none arguing stood innumerable hands
1	were ready in a moment up they turned
1	wide the celestial soil and saw beneath
1	the originals of nature in their crude
1	conception sulphurous and nitrous foam
1	they found they mingled and with subtle art 
1	concocted and adusted they reduced
1	to blackest grain and into store conveyed 
1	part hidden veins digged up nor hath this earth
1	entrails unlike of mineral and stone 
1	whereof to found their engines and their balls
1	of missive ruin part incentive reed
1	provide pernicious with one touch to fire 
1	so all ere day spring under conscious night 
1	secret they finished and in order set 
1	with silent circumspection unespied 
1	now when fair morn orient in heaven appeared 
1	up rose the victor angels and to arms
1	the matin trumpet sung in arms they stood
1	of golden panoply refulgent host 
1	soon banded others from the dawning hills
1	look round and scouts each coast light armed scour 
1	each quarter to descry the distant foe 
1	where lodged or whither fled or if for fight 
1	in motion or in halt him soon they met
1	under spread ensigns moving nigh in slow
1	but firm battalion back with speediest sail
1	zophiel of cherubim the swiftest wing 
1	came flying and in mid air aloud thus cried 
1	arm warriours arm for fight the foe at hand 
1	whom fled we thought will save us long pursuit
1	this day fear not his flight so thick a cloud
1	he comes and settled in his face i see
1	sad resolution and secure let each
1	his adamantine coat gird well and each
1	fit well his helm gripe fast his orbed shield 
1	borne even or high for this day will pour down 
1	if i conjecture aught no drizzling shower 
1	but rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire 
1	so warned he them aware themselves and soon
1	in order quit of all impediment 
1	instant without disturb they took alarm 
1	and onward moved embattled when behold 
1	not distant far with heavy pace the foe
1	approaching gross and huge in hollow cube
1	training his devilish enginery impaled
1	on every side with shadowing squadrons deep 
1	to hide the fraud at interview both stood
1	a while but suddenly at head appeared
1	satan and thus was heard commanding loud 
1	vanguard to right and left the front unfold 
1	that all may see who hate us how we seek
1	peace and composure and with open breast
1	stand ready to receive them if they like
1	our overture and turn not back perverse 
1	but that i doubt however witness heaven 
1	heaven witness thou anon while we discharge
1	freely our part ye who appointed stand
1	do as you have in charge and briefly touch
1	what we propound and loud that all may hear 
1	so scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce
1	had ended when to right and left the front
1	divided and to either flank retired 
1	which to our eyes discovered new and strange 
1	a triple mounted row of pillars laid
1	on wheels for like to pillars most they seemed 
1	or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir 
1	with branches lopt in wood or mountain felled 
1	brass iron stony mould had not their mouths
1	with hideous orifice gaped on us wide 
1	portending hollow truce at each behind
1	a seraph stood and in his hand a reed
1	stood waving tipt with fire while we suspense 
1	collected stood within our thoughts amused 
1	not long for sudden all at once their reeds
1	put forth and to a narrow vent applied
1	with nicest touch immediate in a flame 
1	but soon obscured with smoke all heaven appeared 
1	from those deep throated engines belched whose roar
1	embowelled with outrageous noise the air 
1	and all her entrails tore disgorging foul
1	their devilish glut chained thunderbolts and hail
1	of iron globes which on the victor host
1	levelled with such impetuous fury smote 
1	that whom they hit none on their feet might stand 
1	though standing else as rocks but down they fell
1	by thousands angel on arch angel rolled 
1	the sooner for their arms unarmed they might
1	have easily as spirits evaded swift
1	by quick contraction or remove but now
1	foul dissipation followed and forced rout 
1	nor served it to relax their serried files 
1	what should they do if on they rushed repulse
1	repeated and indecent overthrow
1	doubled would render them yet more despised 
1	and to their foes a laughter for in view
1	stood ranked of seraphim another row 
1	in posture to displode their second tire
1	of thunder back defeated to return
1	they worse abhorred satan beheld their plight 
1	and to his mates thus in derision called 
1	o friends why come not on these victors proud
1	ere while they fierce were coming and when we 
1	to entertain them fair with open front
1	and breast what could we more propounded terms
1	of composition straight they changed their minds 
1	flew off and into strange vagaries fell 
1	as they would dance yet for a dance they seemed
1	somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps
1	for joy of offered peace but i suppose 
1	if our proposals once again were heard 
1	we should compel them to a quick result 
1	to whom thus belial in like gamesome mood 
1	leader the terms we sent were terms of weight 
1	of hard contents and full of force urged home 
1	such as we might perceive amused them all 
1	and stumbled many who receives them right 
1	had need from head to foot well understand 
1	not understood this gift they have besides 
1	they show us when our foes walk not upright 
1	so they among themselves in pleasant vein
1	stood scoffing hightened in their thoughts beyond
1	all doubt of victory eternal might
1	to match with their inventions they presumed
1	so easy and of his thunder made a scorn 
1	and all his host derided while they stood
1	a while in trouble but they stood not long 
1	rage prompted them at length and found them arms
1	against such hellish mischief fit to oppose 
1	forthwith behold the excellence the power 
1	which god hath in his mighty angels placed 
1	their arms away they threw and to the hills
1	 for earth hath this variety from heaven
1	of pleasure situate in hill and dale 
1	light as the lightning glimpse they ran they flew 
1	from their foundations loosening to and fro 
1	they plucked the seated hills with all their load 
1	rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops
1	up lifting bore them in their hands amaze 
1	be sure and terrour seized the rebel host 
1	when coming towards them so dread they saw
1	the bottom of the mountains upward turned 
1	till on those cursed engines triple row
1	they saw them whelmed and all their confidence
1	under the weight of mountains buried deep 
1	themselves invaded next and on their heads
1	main promontories flung which in the air
1	came shadowing and oppressed whole legions armed 
1	their armour helped their harm crushed in and bruised
1	into their substance pent which wrought them pain
1	implacable and many a dolorous groan 
1	long struggling underneath ere they could wind
1	out of such prison though spirits of purest light 
1	purest at first now gross by sinning grown 
1	the rest in imitation to like arms
1	betook them and the neighbouring hills uptore 
1	so hills amid the air encountered hills 
1	hurled to and fro with jaculation dire 
1	that under ground they fought in dismal shade 
1	infernal noise war seemed a civil game
1	to this uproar horrid confusion heaped
1	upon confusion rose and now all heaven
1	had gone to wrack with ruin overspread 
1	had not the almighty father where he sits
1	shrined in his sanctuary of heaven secure 
1	consulting on the sum of things foreseen
1	this tumult and permitted all advised 
1	that his great purpose he might so fulfil 
1	to honour his anointed son avenged
1	upon his enemies and to declare
1	all power on him transferred whence to his son 
1	the assessour of his throne he thus began 
1	effulgence of my glory son beloved 
1	son in whose face invisible is beheld
1	visibly what by deity i am 
1	and in whose hand what by decree i do 
1	second omnipotence two days are past 
1	two days as we compute the days of heaven 
1	since michael and his powers went forth to tame
1	these disobedient sore hath been their fight 
1	as likeliest was when two such foes met armed 
1	for to themselves i left them and thou knowest 
1	equal in their creation they were formed 
1	save what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought
1	insensibly for i suspend their doom 
1	whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
1	endless and no solution will be found 
1	war wearied hath performed what war can do 
1	and to disordered rage let loose the reins
1	with mountains as with weapons armed which makes
1	wild work in heaven and dangerous to the main 
1	two days are therefore past the third is thine 
1	for thee i have ordained it and thus far
1	have suffered that the glory may be thine
1	of ending this great war since none but thou
1	can end it into thee such virtue and grace
1	immense i have transfused that all may know
1	in heaven and hell thy power above compare 
1	and this perverse commotion governed thus 
1	to manifest thee worthiest to be heir
1	of all things to be heir and to be king
1	by sacred unction thy deserved right 
1	go then thou mightiest in thy father s might 
1	ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels
1	that shake heaven s basis bring forth all my war 
1	my bow and thunder my almighty arms
1	gird on and sword upon thy puissant thigh 
1	pursue these sons of darkness drive them out
1	from all heaven s bounds into the utter deep 
1	there let them learn as likes them to despise
1	god and messiah his anointed king 
1	he said and on his son with rays direct
1	shone full he all his father full expressed
1	ineffably into his face received 
1	and thus the filial godhead answering spake 
1	o father o supreme of heavenly thrones 
1	first highest holiest best thou always seek st
1	to glorify thy son i always thee 
1	as is most just this i my glory account 
1	my exaltation and my whole delight 
1	that thou in me well pleased declarest thy will
1	fulfilled which to fulfil is all my bliss 
1	scepter and power thy giving i assume 
1	and gladlier shall resign when in the end
1	thou shalt be all in all and i in thee
1	for ever and in me all whom thou lovest 
1	but whom thou hatest i hate and can put on
1	thy terrours as i put thy mildness on 
1	image of thee in all things and shall soon 
1	armed with thy might rid heaven of these rebelled 
1	to their prepared ill mansion driven down 
1	to chains of darkness and the undying worm 
1	that from thy just obedience could revolt 
1	whom to obey is happiness entire 
1	then shall thy saints unmixed and from the impure
1	far separate circling thy holy mount 
1	unfeigned halleluiahs to thee sing 
1	hymns of high praise and i among them chief 
1	so said he o er his scepter bowing rose
1	from the right hand of glory where he sat 
1	and the third sacred morn began to shine 
1	dawning through heaven forth rushed with whirlwind sound
1	the chariot of paternal deity 
1	flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn 
1	itself instinct with spirit but convoyed
1	by four cherubick shapes four faces each
1	had wonderous as with stars their bodies all
1	and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels
1	of beryl and careering fires between 
1	over their heads a crystal firmament 
1	whereon a sapphire throne inlaid with pure
1	amber and colours of the showery arch 
1	he in celestial panoply all armed
1	of radiant urim work divinely wrought 
1	ascended at his right hand victory
1	sat eagle winged beside him hung his bow
1	and quiver with three bolted thunder stored 
1	and from about him fierce effusion rolled
1	of smoke and bickering flame and sparkles dire 
1	attended with ten thousand thousand saints 
1	he onward came far off his coming shone 
1	and twenty thousand i their number heard 
1	chariots of god half on each hand were seen 
1	he on the wings of cherub rode sublime
1	on the crystalline sky in sapphire throned 
1	illustrious far and wide but by his own
1	first seen them unexpected joy surprised 
1	when the great ensign of messiah blazed
1	aloft by angels borne his sign in heaven 
1	under whose conduct michael soon reduced
1	his army circumfused on either wing 
1	under their head imbodied all in one 
1	before him power divine his way prepared 
1	at his command the uprooted hills retired
1	each to his place they heard his voice and went
1	obsequious heaven his wonted face renewed 
1	and with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled 
1	this saw his hapless foes but stood obdured 
1	and to rebellious fight rallied their powers 
1	insensate hope conceiving from despair 
1	in heavenly spirits could such perverseness dwell 
1	but to convince the proud what signs avail 
1	or wonders move the obdurate to relent 
1	they hardened more by what might most reclaim 
1	grieving to see his glory at the sight
1	took envy and aspiring to his highth 
1	stood re embattled fierce by force or fraud
1	weening to prosper and at length prevail
1	against god and messiah or to fall
1	in universal ruin last and now
1	to final battle drew disdaining flight 
1	or faint retreat when the great son of god
1	to all his host on either hand thus spake 
1	stand still in bright array ye saints here stand 
1	ye angels armed this day from battle rest 
1	faithful hath been your warfare and of god
1	accepted fearless in his righteous cause 
1	and as ye have received so have ye done 
1	invincibly but of this cursed crew
1	the punishment to other hand belongs 
1	vengeance is his or whose he sole appoints 
1	number to this day s work is not ordained 
1	nor multitude stand only and behold
1	god s indignation on these godless poured
1	by me not you but me they have despised 
1	yet envied against me is all their rage 
1	because the father to whom in heaven s preme
1	kingdom and power and glory appertains 
1	hath honoured me according to his will 
1	therefore to me their doom he hath assigned 
1	that they may have their wish to try with me
1	in battle which the stronger proves they all 
1	or i alone against them since by strength
1	they measure all of other excellence
1	not emulous nor care who them excels 
1	nor other strife with them do i vouchsafe 
1	so spake the son and into terrour changed
1	his countenance too severe to be beheld 
1	and full of wrath bent on his enemies 
1	at once the four spread out their starry wings
1	with dreadful shade contiguous and the orbs
1	of his fierce chariot rolled as with the sound
1	of torrent floods or of a numerous host 
1	he on his impious foes right onward drove 
1	gloomy as night under his burning wheels
1	the stedfast empyrean shook throughout 
1	all but the throne itself of god full soon
1	among them he arrived in his right hand
1	grasping ten thousand thunders which he sent
1	before him such as in their souls infixed
1	plagues they astonished all resistance lost 
1	all courage down their idle weapons dropt 
1	o er shields and helms and helmed heads he rode
1	of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate 
1	that wished the mountains now might be again
1	thrown on them as a shelter from his ire 
1	nor less on either side tempestuous fell
1	his arrows from the fourfold visaged four
1	distinct with eyes and from the living wheels
1	distinct alike with multitude of eyes 
1	one spirit in them ruled and every eye
1	glared lightning and shot forth pernicious fire
1	among the accursed that withered all their strength 
1	and of their wonted vigour left them drained 
1	exhausted spiritless afflicted fallen 
1	yet half his strength he put not forth but checked
1	his thunder in mid volley for he meant
1	not to destroy but root them out of heaven 
1	the overthrown he raised and as a herd
1	of goats or timorous flock together thronged
1	drove them before him thunder struck pursued
1	with terrours and with furies to the bounds
1	and crystal wall of heaven which opening wide 
1	rolled inward and a spacious gap disclosed
1	into the wasteful deep the monstrous sight
1	struck them with horrour backward but far worse
1	urged them behind headlong themselves they threw
1	down from the verge of heaven eternal wrath
1	burnt after them to the bottomless pit 
1	hell heard the unsufferable noise hell saw
1	heaven ruining from heaven and would have fled
1	affrighted but strict fate had cast too deep
1	her dark foundations and too fast had bound 
1	nine days they fell confounded chaos roared 
1	and felt tenfold confusion in their fall
1	through his wild anarchy so huge a rout
1	incumbered him with ruin hell at last
1	yawning received them whole and on them closed 
1	hell their fit habitation fraught with fire
1	unquenchable the house of woe and pain 
1	disburdened heaven rejoiced and soon repaired
1	her mural breach returning whence it rolled 
1	sole victor from the expulsion of his foes 
1	messiah his triumphal chariot turned 
1	to meet him all his saints who silent stood
1	eye witnesses of his almighty acts 
1	with jubilee advanced and as they went 
1	shaded with branching palm each order bright 
1	sung triumph and him sung victorious king 
1	son heir and lord to him dominion given 
1	worthiest to reign he celebrated rode
1	triumphant through mid heaven into the courts
1	and temple of his mighty father throned
1	on high who into glory him received 
1	where now he sits at the right hand of bliss 
1	thus measuring things in heaven by things on earth 
1	at thy request and that thou mayest beware
1	by what is past to thee i have revealed
1	what might have else to human race been hid 
1	the discord which befel and war in heaven
1	among the angelick powers and the deep fall
1	of those too high aspiring who rebelled
1	with satan he who envies now thy state 
1	who now is plotting how he may seduce
1	thee also from obedience that with him
1	bereaved of happiness thou mayest partake
1	his punishment eternal misery 
1	which would be all his solace and revenge 
1	as a despite done against the most high 
1	thee once to gain companion of his woe 
1	but listen not to his temptations warn
1	thy weaker let it profit thee to have heard 
1	by terrible example the reward
1	of disobedience firm they might have stood 
1	yet fell remember and fear to transgress 
1	descend from heaven urania by that name
1	if rightly thou art called whose voice divine
1	following above the olympian hill i soar 
1	above the flight of pegasean wing 
1	the meaning not the name i call for thou
1	nor of the muses nine nor on the top
1	of old olympus dwellest but heavenly born 
1	before the hills appeared or fountain flowed 
1	thou with eternal wisdom didst converse 
1	wisdom thy sister and with her didst play
1	in presence of the almighty father pleased
1	with thy celestial song up led by thee
1	into the heaven of heavens i have presumed 
1	an earthly guest and drawn empyreal air 
1	thy tempering with like safety guided down
1	return me to my native element 
1	lest from this flying steed unreined as once
1	bellerophon though from a lower clime 
1	dismounted on the aleian field i fall 
1	erroneous there to wander and forlorn 
1	half yet remains unsung but narrower bound
1	within the visible diurnal sphere 
1	standing on earth not rapt above the pole 
1	more safe i sing with mortal voice unchanged
1	to hoarse or mute though fallen on evil days 
1	on evil days though fallen and evil tongues 
1	in darkness and with dangers compassed round 
1	and solitude yet not alone while thou
1	visitest my slumbers nightly or when morn
1	purples the east still govern thou my song 
1	urania and fit audience find though few 
1	but drive far off the barbarous dissonance
1	of bacchus and his revellers the race
1	of that wild rout that tore the thracian bard
1	in rhodope where woods and rocks had ears
1	to rapture till the savage clamour drowned
1	both harp and voice nor could the muse defend
1	her son so fail not thou who thee implores 
1	for thou art heavenly she an empty dream 
1	say goddess what ensued when raphael 
1	the affable arch angel had forewarned
1	adam by dire example to beware
1	apostasy by what befel in heaven
1	to those apostates lest the like befall
1	in paradise to adam or his race 
1	charged not to touch the interdicted tree 
1	if they transgress and slight that sole command 
1	so easily obeyed amid the choice
1	of all tastes else to please their appetite 
1	though wandering he with his consorted eve 
1	the story heard attentive and was filled
1	with admiration and deep muse to hear
1	of things so high and strange things to their thought
1	so unimaginable as hate in heaven 
1	and war so near the peace of god in bliss 
1	with such confusion but the evil soon
1	driven back redounded as a flood on those
1	from whom it sprung impossible to mix
1	with blessedness whence adam soon repealed
1	the doubts that in his heart arose and now
1	led on yet sinless with desire to know
1	what nearer might concern him how this world
1	of heaven and earth conspicuous first began 
1	when and whereof created for what cause 
1	what within eden or without was done
1	before his memory as one whose drouth
1	yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream 
1	whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites 
1	proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest 
1	great things and full of wonder in our ears 
1	far differing from this world thou hast revealed 
1	divine interpreter by favour sent
1	down from the empyrean to forewarn
1	us timely of what might else have been our loss 
1	unknown which human knowledge could not reach 
1	for which to the infinitely good we owe
1	immortal thanks and his admonishment
1	receive with solemn purpose to observe
1	immutably his sovran will the end
1	of what we are but since thou hast vouchsafed
1	gently for our instruction to impart
1	things above earthly thought which yet concerned
1	our knowing as to highest wisdom seemed 
1	deign to descend now lower and relate
1	what may no less perhaps avail us known 
1	how first began this heaven which we behold
1	distant so high with moving fires adorned
1	innumerable and this which yields or fills
1	all space the ambient air wide interfused
1	embracing round this floried earth what cause
1	moved the creator in his holy rest
1	through all eternity so late to build
1	in chaos and the work begun how soon
1	absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold
1	what we not to explore the secrets ask
1	of his eternal empire but the more
1	to magnify his works the more we know 
1	and the great light of day yet wants to run
1	much of his race though steep suspense in heaven 
1	held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears 
1	and longer will delay to hear thee tell
1	his generation and the rising birth
1	of nature from the unapparent deep 
1	or if the star of evening and the moon
1	haste to thy audience night with her will bring 
1	silence and sleep listening to thee will watch 
1	or we can bid his absence till thy song
1	end and dismiss thee ere the morning shine 
1	thus adam his illustrious guest besought 
1	and thus the godlike angel answered mild 
1	this also thy request with caution asked 
1	obtain though to recount almighty works
1	what words or tongue of seraph can suffice 
1	or heart of man suffice to comprehend 
1	yet what thou canst attain which best may serve
1	to glorify the maker and infer
1	thee also happier shall not be withheld
1	thy hearing such commission from above
1	i have received to answer thy desire
1	of knowledge within bounds beyond abstain
1	to ask nor let thine own inventions hope
1	things not revealed which the invisible king 
1	only omniscient hath suppressed in night 
1	to none communicable in earth or heaven 
1	enough is left besides to search and know 
1	but knowledge is as food and needs no less
1	her temperance over appetite to know
1	in measure what the mind may well contain 
1	oppresses else with surfeit and soon turns
1	wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind 
1	know then that after lucifer from heaven
1	 so call him brighter once amidst the host
1	of angels than that star the stars among 
1	fell with his flaming legions through the deep
1	into his place and the great son returned
1	victorious with his saints the omnipotent
1	eternal father from his throne beheld
1	their multitude and to his son thus spake 
1	at least our envious foe hath failed who thought
1	all like himself rebellious by whose aid
1	this inaccessible high strength the seat
1	of deity supreme us dispossessed 
1	he trusted to have seised and into fraud
1	drew many whom their place knows here no more 
1	yet far the greater part have kept i see 
1	their station heaven yet populous retains
1	number sufficient to possess her realms
1	though wide and this high temple to frequent
1	with ministeries due and solemn rites 
1	but lest his heart exalt him in the harm
1	already done to have dispeopled heaven 
1	my damage fondly deemed i can repair
1	that detriment if such it be to lose
1	self lost and in a moment will create
1	another world out of one man a race
1	of men innumerable there to dwell 
1	not here till by degrees of merit raised 
1	they open to themselves at length the way
1	up hither under long obedience tried 
1	and earth be changed to heaven and heaven to earth 
1	one kingdom joy and union without end 
1	mean while inhabit lax ye powers of heaven 
1	and thou my word begotten son by thee
1	this i perform speak thou and be it done 
1	my overshadowing spirit and might with thee
1	i send along ride forth and bid the deep
1	within appointed bounds be heaven and earth 
1	boundless the deep because i am who fill
1	infinitude nor vacuous the space 
1	though i uncircumscribed myself retire 
1	and put not forth my goodness which is free
1	to act or not necessity and chance
1	approach not me and what i will is fate 
1	so spake the almighty and to what he spake
1	his word the filial godhead gave effect 
1	immediate are the acts of god more swift
1	than time or motion but to human ears
1	cannot without process of speech be told 
1	so told as earthly notion can receive 
1	great triumph and rejoicing was in heaven 
1	when such was heard declared the almighty s will 
1	glory they sung to the most high good will
1	to future men and in their dwellings peace 
1	glory to him whose just avenging ire
1	had driven out the ungodly from his sight
1	and the habitations of the just to him
1	glory and praise whose wisdom had ordained
1	good out of evil to create instead
1	of spirits malign a better race to bring
1	into their vacant room and thence diffuse
1	his good to worlds and ages infinite 
1	so sang the hierarchies mean while the son
1	on his great expedition now appeared 
1	girt with omnipotence with radiance crowned
1	of majesty divine sapience and love
1	immense and all his father in him shone 
1	about his chariot numberless were poured
1	and virtues winged spirits and chariots winged
1	from the armoury of god where stand of old
1	myriads between two brazen mountains lodged
1	against a solemn day harnessed at hand 
1	celestial equipage and now came forth
1	spontaneous for within them spirit lived 
1	attendant on their lord heaven opened wide
1	her ever during gates harmonious sound
1	on golden hinges moving to let forth
1	the king of glory in his powerful word
1	and spirit coming to create new worlds 
1	on heavenly ground they stood and from the shore
1	they viewed the vast immeasurable abyss
1	outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild 
1	up from the bottom turned by furious winds
1	and surging waves as mountains to assault
1	heaven s highth and with the center mix the pole 
1	silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace 
1	said then the omnifick word your discord end 
1	nor staid but on the wings of cherubim
1	uplifted in paternal glory rode
1	far into chaos and the world unborn 
1	for chaos heard his voice him all his train
1	followed in bright procession to behold
1	creation and the wonders of his might 
1	then staid the fervid wheels and in his hand
1	he took the golden compasses prepared
1	in god s eternal store to circumscribe
1	this universe and all created things 
1	one foot he centered and the other turned
1	round through the vast profundity obscure 
1	and said thus far extend thus far thy bounds 
1	this be thy just circumference o world 
1	thus god the heaven created thus the earth 
1	matter unformed and void darkness profound
1	covered the abyss but on the watery calm
1	his brooding wings the spirit of god outspread 
1	and vital virtue infused and vital warmth
1	throughout the fluid mass but downward purged
1	the black tartareous cold infernal dregs 
1	adverse to life then founded then conglobed
1	like things to like the rest to several place
1	disparted and between spun out the air 
1	and earth self balanced on her center hung 
1	let there be light said god and forthwith light
1	ethereal first of things quintessence pure 
1	sprung from the deep and from her native east
1	to journey through the aery gloom began 
1	sphered in a radiant cloud for yet the sun
1	was not she in a cloudy tabernacle
1	sojourned the while god saw the light was good 
1	and light from darkness by the hemisphere
1	divided light the day and darkness night 
1	he named thus was the first day even and morn 
1	nor past uncelebrated nor unsung
1	by the celestial quires when orient light
1	exhaling first from darkness they beheld 
1	birth day of heaven and earth with joy and shout
1	the hollow universal orb they filled 
1	and touched their golden harps and hymning praised
1	god and his works creator him they sung 
1	both when first evening was and when first morn 
1	again god said let there be firmament
1	amid the waters and let it divide
1	the waters from the waters and god made
1	the firmament expanse of liquid pure 
1	transparent elemental air diffused
1	in circuit to the uttermost convex
1	of this great round partition firm and sure 
1	the waters underneath from those above
1	dividing for as earth so he the world
1	built on circumfluous waters calm in wide
1	crystalline ocean and the loud misrule
1	of chaos far removed lest fierce extremes
1	contiguous might distemper the whole frame 
1	and heaven he named the firmament so even
1	and morning chorus sung the second day 
1	the earth was formed but in the womb as yet
1	of waters embryon immature involved 
1	appeared not over all the face of earth
1	main ocean flowed not idle but with warm
1	prolifick humour softening all her globe 
1	fermented the great mother to conceive 
1	satiate with genial moisture when god said 
1	be gathered now ye waters under heaven
1	into one place and let dry land appear 
1	immediately the mountains huge appear
1	emergent and their broad bare backs upheave
1	into the clouds their tops ascend the sky 
1	so high as heaved the tumid hills so low
1	down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep 
1	capacious bed of waters thither they
1	hasted with glad precipitance uprolled 
1	as drops on dust conglobing from the dry 
1	part rise in crystal wall or ridge direct 
1	for haste such flight the great command impressed
1	on the swift floods as armies at the call
1	of trumpet for of armies thou hast heard 
1	troop to their standard so the watery throng 
1	wave rolling after wave where way they found 
1	if steep with torrent rapture if through plain 
1	soft ebbing nor withstood them rock or hill 
1	but they or under ground or circuit wide
1	with serpent errour wandering found their way 
1	and on the washy oose deep channels wore 
1	easy ere god had bid the ground be dry 
1	all but within those banks where rivers now
1	stream and perpetual draw their humid train 
1	the dry land earth and the great receptacle
1	of congregated waters he called seas 
1	and saw that it was good and said let the earth
1	put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed 
1	and fruit tree yielding fruit after her kind 
1	whose seed is in herself upon the earth 
1	he scarce had said when the bare earth till then
1	desart and bare unsightly unadorned 
1	brought forth the tender grass whose verdure clad
1	her universal face with pleasant green 
1	then herbs of every leaf that sudden flowered
1	opening their various colours and made gay
1	her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown 
1	forth flourished thick the clustering vine forth crept
1	the swelling gourd up stood the corny reed
1	embattled in her field and the humble shrub 
1	and bush with frizzled hair implicit last
1	rose as in dance the stately trees and spread
1	their branches hung with copious fruit or gemmed
1	their blossoms with high woods the hills were crowned 
1	with tufts the valleys and each fountain side 
1	with borders long the rivers that earth now
1	seemed like to heaven a seat where gods might dwell 
1	or wander with delight and love to haunt
1	her sacred shades though god had yet not rained
1	upon the earth and man to till the ground
1	none was but from the earth a dewy mist
1	went up and watered all the ground and each
1	plant of the field which ere it was in the earth 
1	god made and every herb before it grew
1	on the green stem god saw that it was good 
1	so even and morn recorded the third day 
1	again the almighty spake let there be lights
1	high in the expanse of heaven to divide
1	the day from night and let them be for signs 
1	for seasons and for days and circling years 
1	and let them be for lights as i ordain
1	their office in the firmament of heaven 
1	to give light on the earth and it was so 
1	and god made two great lights great for their use
1	to man the greater to have rule by day 
1	the less by night altern and made the stars 
1	and set them in the firmament of heaven
1	to illuminate the earth and rule the day
1	in their vicissitude and rule the night 
1	and light from darkness to divide god saw 
1	surveying his great work that it was good 
1	for of celestial bodies first the sun
1	a mighty sphere he framed unlightsome first 
1	though of ethereal mould then formed the moon
1	globose and every magnitude of stars 
1	and sowed with stars the heaven thick as a field 
1	of light by far the greater part he took 
1	transplanted from her cloudy shrine and placed
1	in the sun s orb made porous to receive
1	and drink the liquid light firm to retain
1	her gathered beams great palace now of light 
1	hither as to their fountain other stars
1	repairing in their golden urns draw light 
1	and hence the morning planet gilds her horns 
1	by tincture or reflection they augment
1	their small peculiar though from human sight
1	so far remote with diminution seen 
1	first in his east the glorious lamp was seen 
1	regent of day and all the horizon round
1	invested with bright rays jocund to run
1	his longitude through heaven s high road the gray
1	dawn and the pleiades before him danced 
1	shedding sweet influence less bright the moon 
1	but opposite in levelled west was set 
1	his mirrour with full face borrowing her light
1	from him for other light she needed none
1	in that aspect and still that distance keeps
1	till night then in the east her turn she shines 
1	revolved on heaven s great axle and her reign
1	with thousand lesser lights dividual holds 
1	with thousand thousand stars that then appeared
1	spangling the hemisphere then first adorned
1	with their bright luminaries that set and rose 
1	glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day 
1	and god said let the waters generate
1	reptile with spawn abundant living soul 
1	and let fowl fly above the earth with wings
1	displayed on the open firmament of heaven 
1	and god created the great whales and each
1	soul living each that crept which plenteously
1	the waters generated by their kinds 
1	and every bird of wing after his kind 
1	and saw that it was good and blessed them saying 
1	be fruitful multiply and in the seas 
1	and lakes and running streams the waters fill 
1	and let the fowl be multiplied on the earth 
1	forthwith the sounds and seas each creek and bay 
1	with fry innumerable swarm and shoals
1	of fish that with their fins and shining scales 
1	glide under the green wave in sculls that oft
1	bank the mid sea part single or with mate 
1	graze the sea weed their pasture and through groves
1	of coral stray or sporting with quick glance 
1	show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold 
1	or in their pearly shells at ease attend
1	moist nutriment or under rocks their food
1	in jointed armour watch on smooth the seal
1	and bended dolphins play part huge of bulk
1	wallowing unwieldy enormous in their gait 
1	tempest the ocean there leviathan 
1	hugest of living creatures on the deep
1	stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims 
1	and seems a moving land and at his gills
1	draws in and at his trunk spouts out a sea 
1	mean while the tepid caves and fens and shores 
1	their brood as numerous hatch from the egg that soon
1	bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
1	their callow young but feathered soon and fledge
1	they summed their pens and soaring the air sublime 
1	with clang despised the ground under a cloud
1	in prospect there the eagle and the stork
1	on cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build 
1	part loosely wing the region part more wise
1	in common ranged in figure wedge their way 
1	intelligent of seasons and set forth
1	their aery caravan high over seas
1	flying and over lands with mutual wing
1	easing their flight so steers the prudent crane
1	her annual voyage borne on winds the air
1	floats as they pass fanned with unnumbered plumes 
1	from branch to branch the smaller birds with song
1	solaced the woods and spread their painted wings
1	till even nor then the solemn nightingale
1	ceased warbling but all night tun d her soft lays 
1	others on silver lakes and rivers bathed
1	their downy breast the swan with arched neck 
1	between her white wings mantling proudly rows
1	her state with oary feet yet oft they quit
1	the dank and rising on stiff pennons tower
1	the mid aereal sky others on ground
1	walked firm the crested cock whose clarion sounds
1	the silent hours and the other whose gay train
1	adorns him coloured with the florid hue
1	of rainbows and starry eyes the waters thus
1	with fish replenished and the air with fowl 
1	evening and morn solemnized the fifth day 
1	the sixth and of creation last arose
1	with evening harps and matin when god said 
1	let the earth bring forth soul living in her kind 
1	cattle and creeping things and beast of the earth 
1	each in their kind the earth obeyed and straight
1	opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth
1	innumerous living creatures perfect forms 
1	limbed and full grown out of the ground up rose 
1	as from his lair the wild beast where he wons
1	in forest wild in thicket brake or den 
1	among the trees in pairs they rose they walked 
1	the cattle in the fields and meadows green 
1	those rare and solitary these in flocks
1	pasturing at once and in broad herds upsprung 
1	the grassy clods now calved now half appeared
1	the tawny lion pawing to get free
1	his hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds 
1	and rampant shakes his brinded mane the ounce 
1	the libbard and the tiger as the mole
1	rising the crumbled earth above them threw
1	in hillocks the swift stag from under ground
1	bore up his branching head scarce from his mould
1	behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved
1	his vastness fleeced the flocks and bleating rose 
1	as plants ambiguous between sea and land
1	the river horse and scaly crocodile 
1	at once came forth whatever creeps the ground 
1	insect or worm those waved their limber fans
1	for wings and smallest lineaments exact
1	in all the liveries decked of summer s pride
1	with spots of gold and purple azure and green 
1	these as a line their long dimension drew 
1	streaking the ground with sinuous trace not all
1	minims of nature some of serpent kind 
1	wonderous in length and corpulence involved
1	their snaky folds and added wings first crept
1	the parsimonious emmet provident
1	of future in small room large heart enclosed 
1	pattern of just equality perhaps
1	hereafter joined in her popular tribes
1	of commonalty swarming next appeared
1	the female bee that feeds her husband drone
1	deliciously and builds her waxen cells
1	with honey stored the rest are numberless 
1	and thou their natures knowest and gavest them names 
1	needless to thee repeated nor unknown
1	the serpent subtlest beast of all the field 
1	of huge extent sometimes with brazen eyes
1	and hairy mane terrifick though to thee
1	not noxious but obedient at thy call 
1	now heaven in all her glory shone and rolled
1	her motions as the great first mover s hand
1	first wheeled their course earth in her rich attire
1	consummate lovely smiled air water earth 
1	by fowl fish beast was flown was swum was walked 
1	frequent and of the sixth day yet remained 
1	there wanted yet the master work the end
1	of all yet done a creature who not prone
1	and brute as other creatures but endued
1	with sanctity of reason might erect
1	his stature and upright with front serene
1	govern the rest self knowing and from thence
1	magnanimous to correspond with heaven 
1	but grateful to acknowledge whence his good
1	descends thither with heart and voice and eyes
1	directed in devotion to adore
1	and worship god supreme who made him chief
1	of all his works therefore the omnipotent
1	eternal father for where is not he
1	present thus to his son audibly spake 
1	let us make now man in our image man
1	in our similitude and let them rule
1	over the fish and fowl of sea and air 
1	beast of the field and over all the earth 
1	and every creeping thing that creeps the ground 
1	this said he formed thee adam thee o man 
1	dust of the ground and in thy nostrils breathed
1	the breath of life in his own image he
1	created thee in the image of god
1	express and thou becamest a living soul 
1	male he created thee but thy consort
1	female for race then blessed mankind and said 
1	be fruitful multiply and fill the earth 
1	subdue it and throughout dominion hold
1	over fish of the sea and fowl of the air 
1	and every living thing that moves on the earth 
1	wherever thus created for no place
1	is yet distinct by name thence as thou knowest 
1	he brought thee into this delicious grove 
1	this garden planted with the trees of god 
1	delectable both to behold and taste 
1	and freely all their pleasant fruit for food
1	gave thee all sorts are here that all the earth yields 
1	variety without end but of the tree 
1	which tasted works knowledge of good and evil 
1	thou mayest not in the day thou eatest thou diest 
1	death is the penalty imposed beware 
1	and govern well thy appetite lest sin
1	surprise thee and her black attendant death 
1	here finished he and all that he had made
1	viewed and behold all was entirely good 
1	so even and morn accomplished the sixth day 
1	yet not till the creator from his work
1	desisting though unwearied up returned 
1	up to the heaven of heavens his high abode 
1	thence to behold this new created world 
1	the addition of his empire how it showed
1	in prospect from his throne how good how fair 
1	answering his great idea up he rode
1	followed with acclamation and the sound
1	symphonious of ten thousand harps that tuned
1	angelick harmonies the earth the air
1	resounded thou rememberest for thou heardst 
1	the heavens and all the constellations rung 
1	the planets in their station listening stood 
1	while the bright pomp ascended jubilant 
1	open ye everlasting gates they sung 
1	open ye heavens your living doors let in
1	the great creator from his work returned
1	magnificent his six days work a world 
1	open and henceforth oft for god will deign
1	to visit oft the dwellings of just men 
1	delighted and with frequent intercourse
1	thither will send his winged messengers
1	on errands of supernal grace so sung
1	the glorious train ascending he through heaven 
1	that opened wide her blazing portals led
1	to god s eternal house direct the way 
1	a broad and ample road whose dust is gold
1	and pavement stars as stars to thee appear 
1	seen in the galaxy that milky way 
1	which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
1	powdered with stars and now on earth the seventh
1	evening arose in eden for the sun
1	was set and twilight from the east came on 
1	forerunning night when at the holy mount
1	of heaven s high seated top the imperial throne
1	of godhead fixed for ever firm and sure 
1	the filial power arrived and sat him down
1	with his great father for he also went
1	invisible yet staid such privilege
1	hath omnipresence and the work ordained 
1	author and end of all things and from work
1	now resting blessed and hallowed the seventh day 
1	as resting on that day from all his work 
1	but not in silence holy kept the harp
1	had work and rested not the solemn pipe 
1	and dulcimer all organs of sweet stop 
1	all sounds on fret by string or golden wire 
1	tempered soft tunings intermixed with voice
1	choral or unison of incense clouds 
1	fuming from golden censers hid the mount 
1	creation and the six days acts they sung 
1	great are thy works jehovah infinite
1	thy power what thought can measure thee or tongue
1	relate thee greater now in thy return
1	than from the giant angels thee that day
1	thy thunders magnified but to create
1	is greater than created to destroy 
1	who can impair thee mighty king or bound
1	thy empire easily the proud attempt
1	of spirits apostate and their counsels vain 
1	thou hast repelled while impiously they thought
1	thee to diminish and from thee withdraw
1	the number of thy worshippers who seeks
1	to lessen thee against his purpose serves
1	to manifest the more thy might his evil
1	thou usest and from thence createst more good 
1	witness this new made world another heaven
1	from heaven gate not far founded in view
1	on the clear hyaline the glassy sea 
1	of amplitude almost immense with stars
1	numerous and every star perhaps a world
1	of destined habitation but thou knowest
1	their seasons among these the seat of men 
1	earth with her nether ocean circumfused 
1	their pleasant dwelling place thrice happy men 
1	and sons of men whom god hath thus advanced 
1	created in his image there to dwell
1	and worship him and in reward to rule
1	over his works on earth in sea or air 
1	and multiply a race of worshippers
1	holy and just thrice happy if they know
1	their happiness and persevere upright 
1	so sung they and the empyrean rung
1	with halleluiahs thus was sabbath kept 
1	and thy request think now fulfilled that asked
1	how first this world and face of things began 
1	and what before thy memory was done
1	from the beginning that posterity 
1	informed by thee might know if else thou seekest
1	aught not surpassing human measure say 
1	the angel ended and in adam s ear
1	so charming left his voice that he a while
1	thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear 
1	then as new waked thus gratefully replied 
1	what thanks sufficient or what recompence
1	equal have i to render thee divine
1	historian who thus largely hast allayed
1	the thirst i had of knowledge and vouchsafed
1	this friendly condescension to relate
1	things else by me unsearchable now heard
1	with wonder but delight and as is due 
1	with glory attributed to the high
1	creator something yet of doubt remains 
1	which only thy solution can resolve 
1	when i behold this goodly frame this world 
1	of heaven and earth consisting and compute
1	their magnitudes this earth a spot a grain 
1	an atom with the firmament compared
1	and all her numbered stars that seem to roll
1	spaces incomprehensible for such
1	their distance argues and their swift return
1	diurnal merely to officiate light
1	round this opacous earth this punctual spot 
1	one day and night in all her vast survey
1	useless besides reasoning i oft admire 
1	how nature wise and frugal could commit
1	such disproportions with superfluous hand
1	so many nobler bodies to create 
1	greater so manifold to this one use 
1	for aught appears and on their orbs impose
1	such restless revolution day by day
1	repeated while the sedentary earth 
1	that better might with far less compass move 
1	served by more noble than herself attains
1	her end without least motion and receives 
1	as tribute such a sumless journey brought
1	of incorporeal speed her warmth and light 
1	speed to describe whose swiftness number fails 
1	so spake our sire and by his countenance seemed
1	entering on studious thoughts abstruse which eve
1	perceiving where she sat retired in sight 
1	with lowliness majestick from her seat 
1	and grace that won who saw to wish her stay 
1	rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers 
1	to visit how they prospered bud and bloom 
1	her nursery they at her coming sprung 
1	and touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew 
1	yet went she not as not with such discourse
1	delighted or not capable her ear
1	of what was high such pleasure she reserved 
1	adam relating she sole auditress 
1	her husband the relater she preferred
1	chose rather he she knew would intermix
1	grateful digressions and solve high dispute
1	with conjugal caresses from his lip
1	not words alone pleased her o when meet now
1	such pairs in love and mutual honour joined 
1	with goddess like demeanour forth she went 
1	not unattended for on her as queen 
1	a pomp of winning graces waited still 
1	and from about her shot darts of desire
1	into all eyes to wish her still in sight 
1	and raphael now to adam s doubt proposed 
1	benevolent and facile thus replied 
1	to ask or search i blame thee not for heaven
1	is as the book of god before thee set 
1	wherein to read his wonderous works and learn
1	his seasons hours or days or months or years 
1	this to attain whether heaven move or earth 
1	imports not if thou reckon right the rest
1	from man or angel the great architect
1	did wisely to conceal and not divulge
1	his secrets to be scanned by them who ought
1	rather admire or if they list to try
1	conjecture he his fabrick of the heavens
1	hath left to their disputes perhaps to move
1	his laughter at their quaint opinions wide
1	hereafter when they come to model heaven
1	and calculate the stars how they will wield
1	the mighty frame how build unbuild contrive
1	to save appearances how gird the sphere
1	with centrick and eccentrick scribbled o er 
1	cycle and epicycle orb in orb 
1	already by thy reasoning this i guess 
1	who art to lead thy offspring and supposest
1	that bodies bright and greater should not serve
1	the less not bright nor heaven such journeys run 
1	earth sitting still when she alone receives
1	the benefit consider first that great
1	or bright infers not excellence the earth
1	though in comparison of heaven so small 
1	nor glistering may of solid good contain
1	more plenty than the sun that barren shines 
1	whose virtue on itself works no effect 
1	but in the fruitful earth there first received 
1	his beams unactive else their vigour find 
1	yet not to earth are those bright luminaries
1	officious but to thee earth s habitant 
1	and for the heaven s wide circuit let it speak
1	the maker s high magnificence who built
1	so spacious and his line stretched out so far 
1	that man may know he dwells not in his own 
1	an edifice too large for him to fill 
1	lodged in a small partition and the rest
1	ordained for uses to his lord best known 
1	the swiftness of those circles attribute 
1	though numberless to his omnipotence 
1	that to corporeal substances could add
1	speed almost spiritual me thou thinkest not slow 
1	who since the morning hour set out from heaven
1	where god resides and ere mid day arrived
1	in eden distance inexpressible
1	by numbers that have name but this i urge 
1	admitting motion in the heavens to show
1	invalid that which thee to doubt it moved 
1	not that i so affirm though so it seem
1	to thee who hast thy dwelling here on earth 
1	god to remove his ways from human sense 
1	placed heaven from earth so far that earthly sight 
1	if it presume might err in things too high 
1	and no advantage gain what if the sun
1	be center to the world and other stars 
1	by his attractive virtue and their own
1	incited dance about him various rounds 
1	their wandering course now high now low then hid 
1	progressive retrograde or standing still 
1	in six thou seest and what if seventh to these
1	the planet earth so stedfast though she seem 
1	insensibly three different motions move 
1	which else to several spheres thou must ascribe 
1	moved contrary with thwart obliquities 
1	or save the sun his labour and that swift
1	nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed 
1	invisible else above all stars the wheel
1	of day and night which needs not thy belief 
1	if earth industrious of herself fetch day
1	travelling east and with her part averse
1	from the sun s beam meet night her other part
1	still luminous by his ray what if that light 
1	sent from her through the wide transpicuous air 
1	to the terrestrial moon be as a star 
1	enlightening her by day as she by night
1	this earth reciprocal if land be there 
1	fields and inhabitants her spots thou seest
1	as clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce
1	fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
1	allotted there and other suns perhaps 
1	with their attendant moons thou wilt descry 
1	communicating male and female light 
1	which two great sexes animate the world 
1	stored in each orb perhaps with some that live 
1	for such vast room in nature unpossessed
1	by living soul desart and desolate 
1	only to shine yet scarce to contribute
1	each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far
1	down to this habitable which returns
1	light back to them is obvious to dispute 
1	but whether thus these things or whether not 
1	but whether the sun predominant in heaven 
1	rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun 
1	he from the east his flaming road begin 
1	or she from west her silent course advance 
1	with inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
1	on her soft axle while she paces even 
1	and bears thee soft with the smooth hair along 
1	sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid 
1	leave them to god above him serve and fear 
1	of other creatures as him pleases best 
1	wherever placed let him dispose joy thou
1	in what he gives to thee this paradise
1	and thy fair eve heaven is for thee too high
1	to know what passes there be lowly wise 
1	think only what concerns thee and thy being 
1	dream not of other worlds what creatures there
1	live in what state condition or degree 
1	contented that thus far hath been revealed
1	not of earth only but of highest heaven 
1	to whom thus adam cleared of doubt replied 
1	how fully hast thou satisfied me pure
1	intelligence of heaven angel serene 
1	and freed from intricacies taught to live
1	the easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts
1	to interrupt the sweet of life from which
1	god hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares 
1	and not molest us unless we ourselves
1	seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain 
1	but apt the mind or fancy is to rove
1	unchecked and of her roving is no end 
1	till warned or by experience taught she learn 
1	that not to know at large of things remote
1	from use obscure and subtle but to know
1	that which before us lies in daily life 
1	is the prime wisdom what is more is fume 
1	or emptiness or fond impertinence 
1	and renders us in things that most concern 
1	unpractised unprepared and still to seek 
1	therefore from this high pitch let us descend
1	a lower flight and speak of things at hand
1	useful whence haply mention may arise
1	of something not unseasonable to ask 
1	by sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned 
1	thee i have heard relating what was done
1	ere my remembrance now hear me relate
1	my story which perhaps thou hast not heard 
1	and day is not yet spent till then thou seest
1	how subtly to detain thee i devise 
1	inviting thee to hear while i relate 
1	fond were it not in hope of thy reply 
1	for while i sit with thee i seem in heaven 
1	and sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
1	than fruits of palm tree pleasantest to thirst
1	and hunger both from labour at the hour
1	of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill 
1	though pleasant but thy words with grace divine
1	imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety 
1	to whom thus raphael answered heavenly meek 
1	nor are thy lips ungraceful sire of men 
1	nor tongue ineloquent for god on thee
1	abundantly his gifts hath also poured
1	inward and outward both his image fair 
1	speaking or mute all comeliness and grace
1	attends thee and each word each motion forms 
1	nor less think we in heaven of thee on earth
1	than of our fellow servant and inquire
1	gladly into the ways of god with man 
1	for god we see hath honoured thee and set
1	on man his equal love say therefore on 
1	for i that day was absent as befel 
1	bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure 
1	far on excursion toward the gates of hell 
1	squared in full legion such command we had 
1	to see that none thence issued forth a spy 
1	or enemy while god was in his work 
1	lest he incensed at such eruption bold 
1	destruction with creation might have mixed 
1	not that they durst without his leave attempt 
1	but us he sends upon his high behests
1	for state as sovran king and to inure
1	our prompt obedience fast we found fast shut 
1	the dismal gates and barricadoed strong 
1	but long ere our approaching heard within
1	noise other than the sound of dance or song 
1	torment and loud lament and furious rage 
1	glad we returned up to the coasts of light
1	ere sabbath evening so we had in charge 
1	but thy relation now for i attend 
1	pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine 
1	so spake the godlike power and thus our sire 
1	for man to tell how human life began
1	is hard for who himself beginning knew
1	desire with thee still longer to converse
1	induced me as new waked from soundest sleep 
1	soft on the flowery herb i found me laid 
1	in balmy sweat which with his beams the sun
1	soon dried and on the reeking moisture fed 
1	straight toward heaven my wondering eyes i turned 
1	and gazed a while the ample sky till raised
1	by quick instinctive motion up i sprung 
1	as thitherward endeavouring and upright
1	stood on my feet about me round i saw
1	hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains 
1	and liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these 
1	creatures that lived and moved and walked or flew 
1	birds on the branches warbling all things smiled 
1	with fragrance and with joy my heart o erflowed 
1	myself i then perused and limb by limb
1	surveyed and sometimes went and sometimes ran
1	with supple joints as lively vigour led 
1	but who i was or where or from what cause 
1	knew not to speak i tried and forthwith spake 
1	my tongue obeyed and readily could name
1	whate er i saw thou sun said i fair light 
1	and thou enlightened earth so fresh and gay 
1	and ye that live and move fair creatures tell 
1	tell if ye saw how i came thus how here 
1	not of myself by some great maker then 
1	in goodness and in power pre eminent 
1	tell me how may i know him how adore 
1	from whom i have that thus i move and live 
1	and feel that i am happier than i know 
1	while thus i called and strayed i knew not whither 
1	from where i first drew air and first beheld
1	this happy light when answer none returned 
1	on a green shady bank profuse of flowers 
1	pensive i sat me down there gentle sleep
1	first found me and with soft oppression seised
1	my droused sense untroubled though i thought
1	i then was passing to my former state
1	insensible and forthwith to dissolve 
1	when suddenly stood at my head a dream 
1	whose inward apparition gently moved
1	my fancy to believe i yet had being 
1	and lived one came methought of shape divine 
1	and said thy mansion wants thee adam rise 
1	first man of men innumerable ordained
1	first father called by thee i come thy guide
1	to the garden of bliss thy seat prepared 
1	so saying by the hand he took me raised 
1	and over fields and waters as in air
1	smooth sliding without step last led me up
1	a woody mountain whose high top was plain 
1	a circuit wide enclosed with goodliest trees
1	planted with walks and bowers that what i saw
1	of earth before scarce pleasant seemed each tree 
1	loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye
1	tempting stirred in me sudden appetite
1	to pluck and eat whereat i waked and found
1	before mine eyes all real as the dream
1	had lively shadowed here had new begun
1	my wandering had not he who was my guide
1	up hither from among the trees appeared 
1	presence divine rejoicing but with awe 
1	in adoration at his feet i fell
1	submiss he reared me and whom thou soughtest i am 
1	said mildly author of all this thou seest
1	above or round about thee or beneath 
1	this paradise i give thee count it thine
1	to till and keep and of the fruit to eat 
1	of every tree that in the garden grows
1	eat freely with glad heart fear here no dearth 
1	but of the tree whose operation brings
1	knowledge of good and ill which i have set
1	the pledge of thy obedience and thy faith 
1	amid the garden by the tree of life 
1	remember what i warn thee shun to taste 
1	and shun the bitter consequence for know 
1	the day thou eatest thereof my sole command
1	transgressed inevitably thou shalt die 
1	from that day mortal and this happy state
1	shalt lose expelled from hence into a world
1	of woe and sorrow sternly he pronounced
1	the rigid interdiction which resounds
1	yet dreadful in mine ear though in my choice
1	not to incur but soon his clear aspect
1	returned and gracious purpose thus renewed 
1	 not only these fair bounds but all the earth
1	to thee and to thy race i give as lords
1	possess it and all things that therein live 
1	or live in sea or air beast fish and fowl 
1	in sign whereof each bird and beast behold
1	after their kinds i bring them to receive
1	from thee their names and pay thee fealty
1	with low subjection understand the same
1	of fish within their watery residence 
1	not hither summoned since they cannot change
1	their element to draw the thinner air 
1	as thus he spake each bird and beast behold
1	approaching two and two these cowering low
1	with blandishment each bird stooped on his wing 
1	i named them as they passed and understood
1	their nature with such knowledge god endued
1	my sudden apprehension but in these
1	i found not what methought i wanted still 
1	and to the heavenly vision thus presumed 
1	o by what name for thou above all these 
1	above mankind or aught than mankind higher 
1	surpassest far my naming how may i
1	adore thee author of this universe 
1	and all this good to man for whose well being
1	so amply and with hands so liberal 
1	thou hast provided all things but with me
1	i see not who partakes in solitude
1	what happiness who can enjoy alone 
1	or all enjoying what contentment find 
1	thus i presumptuous and the vision bright 
1	as with a smile more brightened thus replied 
1	what callest thou solitude is not the earth
1	with various living creatures and the air
1	replenished and all these at thy command
1	to come and play before thee knowest thou not
1	their language and their ways they also know 
1	and reason not contemptibly with these
1	find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large 
1	so spake the universal lord and seemed
1	so ordering i with leave of speech implored 
1	and humble deprecation thus replied 
1	let not my words offend thee heavenly power 
1	my maker be propitious while i speak 
1	hast thou not made me here thy substitute 
1	and these inferiour far beneath me set 
1	among unequals what society
1	can sort what harmony or true delight 
1	which must be mutual in proportion due
1	given and received but in disparity
1	the one intense the other still remiss 
1	cannot well suit with either but soon prove
1	tedious alike of fellowship i speak
1	such as i seek fit to participate
1	all rational delight wherein the brute
1	cannot be human consort they rejoice
1	each with their kind lion with lioness 
1	so fitly them in pairs thou hast combined 
1	much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl
1	so well converse nor with the ox the ape 
1	worse then can man with beast and least of all 
1	whereto the almighty answered not displeased 
1	a nice and subtle happiness i see 
1	thou to thyself proposest in the choice
1	of thy associates adam and wilt taste
1	no pleasure though in pleasure solitary 
1	what thinkest thou then of me and this my state 
1	seem i to thee sufficiently possessed
1	of happiness or not who am alone
1	from all eternity for none i know
1	second to me or like equal much less 
1	how have i then with whom to hold converse 
1	save with the creatures which i made and those
1	to me inferiour infinite descents
1	beneath what other creatures are to thee 
1	he ceased i lowly answered to attain
1	the highth and depth of thy eternal ways
1	all human thoughts come short supreme of things 
1	thou in thyself art perfect and in thee
1	is no deficience found not so is man 
1	but in degree the cause of his desire
1	by conversation with his like to help
1	or solace his defects no need that thou
1	shouldst propagate already infinite 
1	and through all numbers absolute though one 
1	but man by number is to manifest
1	his single imperfection and beget
1	like of his like his image multiplied 
1	in unity defective which requires
1	collateral love and dearest amity 
1	thou in thy secresy although alone 
1	best with thyself accompanied seekest not
1	social communication yet so pleased 
1	canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt
1	of union or communion deified 
1	i by conversing cannot these erect
1	from prone nor in their ways complacence find 
1	thus i emboldened spake and freedom used
1	permissive and acceptance found which gained
1	this answer from the gracious voice divine 
1	thus far to try thee adam i was pleased 
1	and find thee knowing not of beasts alone 
1	which thou hast rightly named but of thyself 
1	expressing well the spirit within thee free 
1	my image not imparted to the brute 
1	whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
1	good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike 
1	and be so minded still i ere thou spakest 
1	knew it not good for man to be alone 
1	and no such company as then thou sawest
1	intended thee for trial only brought 
1	to see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet 
1	what next i bring shall please thee be assured 
1	thy likeness thy fit help thy other self 
1	thy wish exactly to thy heart s desire 
1	he ended or i heard no more for now
1	my earthly by his heavenly overpowered 
1	which it had long stood under strained to the highth
1	in that celestial colloquy sublime 
1	as with an object that excels the sense
1	dazzled and spent sunk down and sought repair
1	of sleep which instantly fell on me called
1	by nature as in aid and closed mine eyes 
1	mine eyes he closed but open left the cell
1	of fancy my internal sight by which 
1	abstract as in a trance methought i saw 
1	though sleeping where i lay and saw the shape
1	still glorious before whom awake i stood 
1	who stooping opened my left side and took
1	from thence a rib with cordial spirits warm 
1	and life blood streaming fresh wide was the wound 
1	but suddenly with flesh filled up and healed 
1	the rib he formed and fashioned with his hands 
1	under his forming hands a creature grew 
1	man like but different sex so lovely fair 
1	that what seemed fair in all the world seemed now
1	mean or in her summed up in her contained
1	and in her looks which from that time infused
1	sweetness into my heart unfelt before 
1	and into all things from her air inspired
1	the spirit of love and amorous delight 
1	she disappeared and left me dark i waked
1	to find her or for ever to deplore
1	her loss and other pleasures all abjure 
1	when out of hope behold her not far off 
1	such as i saw her in my dream adorned
1	with what all earth or heaven could bestow
1	to make her amiable on she came 
1	led by her heavenly maker though unseen 
1	and guided by his voice nor uninformed
1	of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites 
1	grace was in all her steps heaven in her eye 
1	in every gesture dignity and love 
1	i overjoyed could not forbear aloud 
1	this turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled
1	thy words creator bounteous and benign 
1	giver of all things fair but fairest this
1	of all thy gifts nor enviest i now see
1	bone of my bone flesh of my flesh myself
1	before me woman is her name of man
1	extracted for this cause he shall forego
1	father and mother and to his wife adhere 
1	and they shall be one flesh one heart one soul 
1	she heard me thus and though divinely brought 
1	yet innocence and virgin modesty 
1	her virtue and the conscience of her worth 
1	that would be wooed and not unsought be won 
1	not obvious not obtrusive but retired 
1	the more desirable or to say all 
1	nature herself though pure of sinful thought 
1	wrought in her so that seeing me she turned 
1	i followed her she what was honour knew 
1	and with obsequious majesty approved
1	my pleaded reason to the nuptial bower
1	i led her blushing like the morn all heaven 
1	and happy constellations on that hour
1	shed their selectest influence the earth
1	gave sign of gratulation and each hill 
1	joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs
1	whispered it to the woods and from their wings
1	flung rose flung odours from the spicy shrub 
1	disporting till the amorous bird of night
1	sung spousal and bid haste the evening star
1	on his hill top to light the bridal lamp 
1	thus have i told thee all my state and brought
1	my story to the sum of earthly bliss 
1	which i enjoy and must confess to find
1	in all things else delight indeed but such
1	as used or not works in the mind no change 
1	nor vehement desire these delicacies
1	i mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers 
1	walks and the melody of birds but here
1	far otherwise transported i behold 
1	transported touch here passion first i felt 
1	commotion strange in all enjoyments else
1	superiour and unmoved here only weak
1	against the charm of beauty s powerful glance 
1	or nature failed in me and left some part
1	not proof enough such object to sustain 
1	or from my side subducting took perhaps
1	more than enough at least on her bestowed
1	too much of ornament in outward show
1	elaborate of inward less exact 
1	for well i understand in the prime end
1	of nature her the inferiour in the mind
1	and inward faculties which most excel 
1	in outward also her resembling less
1	his image who made both and less expressing
1	the character of that dominion given
1	o er other creatures yet when i approach
1	her loveliness so absolute she seems
1	and in herself complete so well to know
1	her own that what she wills to do or say 
1	seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best 
1	all higher knowledge in her presence falls
1	degraded wisdom in discourse with her
1	loses discountenanced and like folly shows 
1	authority and reason on her wait 
1	as one intended first not after made
1	occasionally and to consummate all 
1	greatness of mind and nobleness their seat
1	build in her loveliest and create an awe
1	about her as a guard angelick placed 
1	to whom the angel with contracted brow 
1	accuse not nature she hath done her part 
1	do thou but thine and be not diffident
1	of wisdom she deserts thee not if thou
1	dismiss not her when most thou needest her nigh 
1	by attributing overmuch to things
1	less excellent as thou thyself perceivest 
1	for what admirest thou what transports thee so 
1	an outside fair no doubt and worthy well
1	thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love 
1	not thy subjection weigh with her thyself 
1	then value oft times nothing profits more
1	than self esteem grounded on just and right
1	well managed of that skill the more thou knowest 
1	the more she will acknowledge thee her head 
1	and to realities yield all her shows 
1	made so adorn for thy delight the more 
1	so awful that with honour thou mayest love
1	thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise 
1	but if the sense of touch whereby mankind
1	is propagated seem such dear delight
1	beyond all other think the same vouchsafed
1	to cattle and each beast which would not be
1	to them made common and divulged if aught
1	therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
1	the soul of man or passion in him move 
1	what higher in her society thou findest
1	attractive human rational love still 
1	in loving thou dost well in passion not 
1	wherein true love consists not love refines
1	the thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat
1	in reason and is judicious is the scale
1	by which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend 
1	not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause 
1	among the beasts no mate for thee was found 
1	to whom thus half abashed adam replied 
1	neither her outside formed so fair nor aught
1	in procreation common to all kinds 
1	 though higher of the genial bed by far 
1	and with mysterious reverence i deem 
1	so much delights me as those graceful acts 
1	those thousand decencies that daily flow
1	from all her words and actions mixed with love
1	and sweet compliance which declare unfeigned
1	union of mind or in us both one soul 
1	harmony to behold in wedded pair
1	more grateful than harmonious sound to the ear 
1	yet these subject not i to thee disclose
1	what inward thence i feel not therefore foiled 
1	who meet with various objects from the sense
1	variously representing yet still free 
1	approve the best and follow what i approve 
1	to love thou blamest me not for love thou sayest 
1	leads up to heaven is both the way and guide 
1	bear with me then if lawful what i ask 
1	love not the heavenly spirits and how their love
1	express they by looks only or do they mix
1	irradiance virtual or immediate touch 
1	to whom the angel with a smile that glowed
1	celestial rosy red love s proper hue 
1	answered let it suffice thee that thou knowest
1	us happy and without love no happiness 
1	whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest 
1	 and pure thou wert created we enjoy
1	in eminence and obstacle find none
1	of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars 
1	easier than air with air if spirits embrace 
1	total they mix union of pure with pure
1	desiring nor restrained conveyance need 
1	as flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul 
1	but i can now no more the parting sun
1	beyond the earth s green cape and verdant isles
1	hesperian sets my signal to depart 
1	be strong live happy and love but first of all 
1	him whom to love is to obey and keep
1	his great command take heed lest passion sway
1	thy judgement to do aught which else free will
1	would not admit thine and of all thy sons 
1	the weal or woe in thee is placed beware 
1	i in thy persevering shall rejoice 
1	and all the blest stand fast to stand or fall
1	free in thine own arbitrement it lies 
1	perfect within no outward aid require 
1	and all temptation to transgress repel 
1	so saying he arose whom adam thus
1	followed with benediction since to part 
1	go heavenly guest ethereal messenger 
1	sent from whose sovran goodness i adore 
1	gentle to me and affable hath been
1	thy condescension and shall be honoured ever
1	with grateful memory thou to mankind
1	be good and friendly still and oft return 
1	so parted they the angel up to heaven
1	from the thick shade and adam to his bower 
1	no more of talk where god or angel guest
1	with man as with his friend familiar us d 
1	to sit indulgent and with him partake
1	rural repast permitting him the while
1	venial discourse unblam d i now must change
1	those notes to tragick foul distrust and breach
1	disloyal on the part of man revolt 
1	and disobedience on the part of heaven
1	now alienated distance and distaste 
1	anger and just rebuke and judgement given 
1	that brought into this world a world of woe 
1	sin and her shadow death and misery
1	death s harbinger sad task yet argument
1	not less but more heroick than the wrath
1	of stern achilles on his foe pursued
1	thrice fugitive about troy wall or rage
1	of turnus for lavinia disespous d 
1	or neptune s ire or juno s that so long

1	and dictates to me slumbering or inspires

1	since first this subject for heroick song
1	pleas d me long choosing and beginning late

1	the sun was sunk and after him the star
1	of hesperus whose office is to bring
1	twilight upon the earth short arbiter
1	 twixt day and night and now from end to end
1	night s hemisphere had veil d the horizon round 
1	when satan who late fled before the threats
1	of gabriel out of eden now improv d
1	in meditated fraud and malice bent
1	on man s destruction maugre what might hap
1	of heavier on himself fearless returned
1	by night he fled and at midnight returned
1	from compassing the earth cautious of day 
1	since uriel regent of the sun descried
1	his entrance and foreworned the cherubim
1	that kept their watch thence full of anguish driven 
1	the space of seven continued nights he rode
1	with darkness thrice the equinoctial line
1	he circled four times crossed the car of night
1	from pole to pole traversing each colure 
1	on the eighth returned and on the coast averse
1	from entrance or cherubick watch by stealth
1	found unsuspected way there was a place 
1	now not though sin not time first wrought the change 
1	where tigris at the foot of paradise 
1	into a gulf shot under ground till part
1	rose up a fountain by the tree of life 
1	in with the river sunk and with it rose
1	satan involved in rising mist then sought
1	where to lie hid sea he had searched and land 
1	from eden over pontus and the pool
1	maeotis up beyond the river ob 
1	downward as far antarctick and in length 
1	west from orontes to the ocean barred
1	at darien thence to the land where flows
1	ganges and indus thus the orb he roamed
1	with narrow search and with inspection deep
1	considered every creature which of all
1	most opportune might serve his wiles and found
1	the serpent subtlest beast of all the field 
1	him after long debate irresolute
1	of thoughts revolved his final sentence chose
1	fit vessel fittest imp of fraud in whom
1	to enter and his dark suggestions hide
1	from sharpest sight for in the wily snake
1	whatever sleights none would suspicious mark 
1	as from his wit and native subtlety
1	proceeding which in other beasts observed 
1	doubt might beget of diabolick power
1	active within beyond the sense of brute 
1	thus he resolved but first from inward grief
1	his bursting passion into plaints thus poured 
1	more justly seat worthier of gods as built
1	with second thoughts reforming what was old 
1	o earth how like to heaven if not preferred
1	for what god after better worse would build 
1	terrestrial heaven danced round by other heavens
1	that shine yet bear their bright officious lamps 
1	light above light for thee alone as seems 
1	in thee concentring all their precious beams
1	of sacred influence as god in heaven
1	is center yet extends to all so thou 
1	centring receivest from all those orbs in thee 
1	not in themselves all their known virtue appears
1	productive in herb plant and nobler birth
1	of creatures animate with gradual life
1	of growth sense reason all summed up in man 
1	with what delight could i have walked thee round 
1	if i could joy in aught sweet interchange
1	of hill and valley rivers woods and plains 
1	now land now sea and shores with forest crowned 
1	rocks dens and caves but i in none of these
1	find place or refuge and the more i see
1	pleasures about me so much more i feel
1	torment within me as from the hateful siege
1	of contraries all good to me becomes
1	bane and in heaven much worse would be my state 
1	but neither here seek i no nor in heaven
1	to dwell unless by mastering heaven s supreme 
1	nor hope to be myself less miserable
1	by what i seek but others to make such
1	as i though thereby worse to me redound 
1	for only in destroying i find ease
1	to my relentless thoughts and him destroyed 
1	or won to what may work his utter loss 
1	for whom all this was made all this will soon
1	follow as to him linked in weal or woe 
1	in woe then that destruction wide may range 
1	to me shall be the glory sole among
1	the infernal powers in one day to have marred
1	what he almighty styled six nights and days
1	continued making and who knows how long
1	before had been contriving though perhaps
1	not longer than since i in one night freed
1	from servitude inglorious well nigh half
1	the angelick name and thinner left the throng
1	of his adorers he to be avenged 
1	and to repair his numbers thus impaired 
1	whether such virtue spent of old now failed
1	more angels to create if they at least
1	are his created or to spite us more 
1	determined to advance into our room
1	a creature formed of earth and him endow 
1	exalted from so base original 
1	with heavenly spoils our spoils what he decreed 
1	he effected man he made and for him built
1	magnificent this world and earth his seat 
1	him lord pronounced and o indignity 
1	subjected to his service angel wings 
1	and flaming ministers to watch and tend
1	their earthly charge of these the vigilance
1	i dread and to elude thus wrapt in mist
1	of midnight vapour glide obscure and pry
1	in every bush and brake where hap may find
1	the serpent sleeping in whose mazy folds
1	to hide me and the dark intent i bring 
1	o foul descent that i who erst contended
1	with gods to sit the highest am now constrained
1	into a beast and mixed with bestial slime 
1	this essence to incarnate and imbrute 
1	that to the highth of deity aspired 
1	but what will not ambition and revenge
1	descend to who aspires must down as low
1	as high he soared obnoxious first or last 
1	to basest things revenge at first though sweet 
1	bitter ere long back on itself recoils 
1	let it i reck not so it light well aimed 
1	since higher i fall short on him who next
1	provokes my envy this new favourite
1	of heaven this man of clay son of despite 
1	whom us the more to spite his maker raised
1	from dust spite then with spite is best repaid 
1	so saying through each thicket dank or dry 
1	like a black mist low creeping he held on
1	his midnight search where soonest he might find
1	the serpent him fast sleeping soon he found
1	in labyrinth of many a round self rolled 
1	his head the midst well stored with subtile wiles 
1	not yet in horrid shade or dismal den 
1	nor nocent yet but on the grassy herb 
1	fearless unfeared he slept in at his mouth
1	the devil entered and his brutal sense 
1	in heart or head possessing soon inspired
1	with act intelligential but his sleep
1	disturbed not waiting close the approach of morn 
1	now when as sacred light began to dawn
1	in eden on the humid flowers that breathed
1	their morning incense when all things that breathe 
1	from the earth s great altar send up silent praise
1	to the creator and his nostrils fill
1	with grateful smell forth came the human pair 
1	and joined their vocal worship to the quire
1	of creatures wanting voice that done partake
1	the season prime for sweetest scents and airs 
1	then commune how that day they best may ply
1	their growing work for much their work out grew
1	the hands dispatch of two gardening so wide 
1	and eve first to her husband thus began 
1	adam well may we labour still to dress
1	this garden still to tend plant herb and flower 
1	our pleasant task enjoined but till more hands
1	aid us the work under our labour grows 
1	luxurious by restraint what we by day
1	lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind 
1	one night or two with wanton growth derides
1	tending to wild thou therefore now advise 
1	or bear what to my mind first thoughts present 
1	let us divide our labours thou where choice
1	leads thee or where most needs whether to wind
1	the woodbine round this arbour or direct
1	the clasping ivy where to climb while i 
1	in yonder spring of roses intermixed
1	with myrtle find what to redress till noon 
1	for while so near each other thus all day
1	our task we choose what wonder if so near
1	looks intervene and smiles or object new
1	casual discourse draw on which intermits
1	our day s work brought to little though begun
1	early and the hour of supper comes unearned 
1	to whom mild answer adam thus returned 
1	sole eve associate sole to me beyond
1	compare above all living creatures dear 
1	well hast thou motioned well thy thoughts employed 
1	how we might best fulfil the work which here
1	god hath assigned us nor of me shalt pass
1	unpraised for nothing lovelier can be found
1	in woman than to study houshold good 
1	and good works in her husband to promote 
1	yet not so strictly hath our lord imposed
1	labour as to debar us when we need
1	refreshment whether food or talk between 
1	food of the mind or this sweet intercourse
1	of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow 
1	to brute denied and are of love the food 
1	love not the lowest end of human life 
1	for not to irksome toil but to delight 
1	he made us and delight to reason joined 
1	these paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands
1	will keep from wilderness with ease as wide
1	as we need walk till younger hands ere long
1	assist us but if much converse perhaps
1	thee satiate to short absence i could yield 
1	for solitude sometimes is best society 
1	and short retirement urges sweet return 
1	but other doubt possesses me lest harm
1	befall thee severed from me for thou knowest
1	what hath been warned us what malicious foe
1	envying our happiness and of his own
1	despairing seeks to work us woe and shame
1	by sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand
1	watches no doubt with greedy hope to find
1	his wish and best advantage us asunder 
1	hopeless to circumvent us joined where each
1	to other speedy aid might lend at need 
1	whether his first design be to withdraw
1	our fealty from god or to disturb
1	conjugal love than which perhaps no bliss
1	enjoyed by us excites his envy more 
1	or this or worse leave not the faithful side
1	that gave thee being still shades thee and protects 
1	the wife where danger or dishonour lurks 
1	safest and seemliest by her husband stays 
1	who guards her or with her the worst endures 
1	to whom the virgin majesty of eve 
1	as one who loves and some unkindness meets 
1	with sweet austere composure thus replied 
1	offspring of heaven and earth and all earth s lord 
1	that such an enemy we have who seeks
1	our ruin both by thee informed i learn 
1	and from the parting angel over heard 
1	as in a shady nook i stood behind 
1	just then returned at shut of evening flowers 
1	but that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
1	to god or thee because we have a foe
1	may tempt it i expected not to hear 
1	his violence thou fearest not being such
1	as we not capable of death or pain 
1	can either not receive or can repel 
1	his fraud is then thy fear which plain infers
1	thy equal fear that my firm faith and love
1	can by his fraud be shaken or seduced 
1	thoughts which how found they harbour in thy breast 
1	adam mis thought of her to thee so dear 
1	to whom with healing words adam replied 
1	daughter of god and man immortal eve 
1	for such thou art from sin and blame entire 
1	not diffident of thee do i dissuade
1	thy absence from my sight but to avoid
1	the attempt itself intended by our foe 
1	for he who tempts though in vain at least asperses
1	the tempted with dishonour foul supposed
1	not incorruptible of faith not proof
1	against temptation thou thyself with scorn
1	and anger wouldst resent the offered wrong 
1	though ineffectual found misdeem not then 
1	if such affront i labour to avert
1	from thee alone which on us both at once
1	the enemy though bold will hardly dare 
1	or daring first on me the assault shall light 
1	nor thou his malice and false guile contemn 
1	subtle he needs must be who could seduce
1	angels nor think superfluous other s aid 
1	i from the influence of thy looks receive
1	access in every virtue in thy sight
1	more wise more watchful stronger if need were
1	of outward strength while shame thou looking on 
1	shame to be overcome or over reached 
1	would utmost vigour raise and raised unite 
1	why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
1	when i am present and thy trial choose
1	with me best witness of thy virtue tried 
1	so spake domestick adam in his care
1	and matrimonial love but eve who thought
1	less attributed to her faith sincere 
1	thus her reply with accent sweet renewed 
1	if this be our condition thus to dwell
1	in narrow circuit straitened by a foe 
1	subtle or violent we not endued
1	single with like defence wherever met 
1	how are we happy still in fear of harm 
1	but harm precedes not sin only our foe 
1	tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
1	of our integrity his foul esteem
1	sticks no dishonour on our front but turns
1	foul on himself then wherefore shunned or feared
1	by us who rather double honour gain
1	from his surmise proved false find peace within 
1	favour from heaven our witness from the event 
1	and what is faith love virtue unassayed
1	alone without exteriour help sustained 
1	let us not then suspect our happy state
1	left so imperfect by the maker wise 
1	as not secure to single or combined 
1	frail is our happiness if this be so 
1	and eden were no eden thus exposed 
1	to whom thus adam fervently replied 
1	o woman best are all things as the will
1	of god ordained them his creating hand
1	nothing imperfect or deficient left
1	of all that he created much less man 
1	or aught that might his happy state secure 
1	secure from outward force within himself
1	the danger lies yet lies within his power 
1	against his will he can receive no harm 
1	but god left free the will for what obeys
1	reason is free and reason he made right 
1	but bid her well be ware and still erect 
1	lest by some fair appearing good surprised 
1	she dictate false and mis inform the will
1	to do what god expressly hath forbid 
1	not then mistrust but tender love enjoins 
1	that i should mind thee oft and mind thou me 
1	firm we subsist yet possible to swerve 
1	since reason not impossibly may meet
1	some specious object by the foe suborned 
1	and fall into deception unaware 
1	not keeping strictest watch as she was warned 
1	seek not temptation then which to avoid
1	were better and most likely if from me
1	thou sever not trial will come unsought 
1	wouldst thou approve thy constancy approve
1	first thy obedience the other who can know 
1	not seeing thee attempted who attest 
1	but if thou think trial unsought may find
1	us both securer than thus warned thou seemest 
1	go for thy stay not free absents thee more 
1	go in thy native innocence rely
1	on what thou hast of virtue summon all 
1	for god towards thee hath done his part do thine 
1	so spake the patriarch of mankind but eve
1	persisted yet submiss though last replied 
1	with thy permission then and thus forewarned
1	chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
1	touched only that our trial when least sought 
1	may find us both perhaps far less prepared 
1	the willinger i go nor much expect
1	a foe so proud will first the weaker seek 
1	so bent the more shall shame him his repulse 
1	thus saying from her husband s hand her hand
1	soft she withdrew and like a wood nymph light 
1	oread or dryad or of delia s train 
1	betook her to the groves but delia s self
1	in gait surpassed and goddess like deport 
1	though not as she with bow and quiver armed 
1	but with such gardening tools as art yet rude 
1	guiltless of fire had formed or angels brought 
1	to pales or pomona thus adorned 
1	likest she seemed pomona when she fled
1	vertumnus or to ceres in her prime 
1	yet virgin of proserpina from jove 
1	her long with ardent look his eye pursued
1	delighted but desiring more her stay 
1	oft he to her his charge of quick return
1	repeated she to him as oft engaged
1	to be returned by noon amid the bower 
1	and all things in best order to invite
1	noontide repast or afternoon s repose 
1	o much deceived much failing hapless eve 
1	of thy presumed return event perverse 
1	thou never from that hour in paradise
1	foundst either sweet repast or sound repose 
1	such ambush hid among sweet flowers and shades 
1	waited with hellish rancour imminent
1	to intercept thy way or send thee back
1	despoiled of innocence of faith of bliss 
1	for now and since first break of dawn the fiend 
1	mere serpent in appearance forth was come 
1	and on his quest where likeliest he might find
1	the only two of mankind but in them
1	the whole included race his purposed prey 
1	in bower and field he sought where any tuft
1	of grove or garden plot more pleasant lay 
1	their tendance or plantation for delight 
1	by fountain or by shady rivulet
1	he sought them both but wished his hap might find
1	eve separate he wished but not with hope
1	of what so seldom chanced when to his wish 
1	beyond his hope eve separate he spies 
1	veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood 
1	half spied so thick the roses blushing round
1	about her glowed oft stooping to support
1	each flower of slender stalk whose head though gay
1	carnation purple azure or specked with gold 
1	hung drooping unsustained them she upstays
1	gently with myrtle band mindless the while
1	herself though fairest unsupported flower 
1	from her best prop so far and storm so nigh 
1	nearer he drew and many a walk traversed
1	of stateliest covert cedar pine or palm 
1	then voluble and bold now hid now seen 
1	among thick woven arborets and flowers
1	imbordered on each bank the hand of eve 
1	spot more delicious than those gardens feigned
1	or of revived adonis or renowned
1	alcinous host of old laertes son 
1	or that not mystick where the sapient king
1	much he the place admired the person more 
1	as one who long in populous city pent 
1	where houses thick and sewers annoy the air 
1	forth issuing on a summer s morn to breathe
1	among the pleasant villages and farms
1	adjoined from each thing met conceives delight 
1	the smell of grain or tedded grass or kine 
1	or dairy each rural sight each rural sound 
1	if chance with nymph like step fair virgin pass 
1	what pleasing seemed for her now pleases more 
1	she most and in her look sums all delight 
1	such pleasure took the serpent to behold
1	this flowery plat the sweet recess of eve
1	thus early thus alone her heavenly form
1	angelick but more soft and feminine 
1	her graceful innocence her every air
1	of gesture or least action overawed
1	his malice and with rapine sweet bereaved
1	his fierceness of the fierce intent it brought 
1	that space the evil one abstracted stood
1	from his own evil and for the time remained
1	stupidly good of enmity disarmed 
1	of guile of hate of envy of revenge 
1	but the hot hell that always in him burns 
1	though in mid heaven soon ended his delight 
1	and tortures him now more the more he sees
1	of pleasure not for him ordained then soon
1	fierce hate he recollects and all his thoughts
1	of mischief gratulating thus excites 
1	thoughts whither have ye led me with what sweet
1	compulsion thus transported to forget
1	what hither brought us hate not love nor hope
1	of paradise for hell hope here to taste
1	of pleasure but all pleasure to destroy 
1	save what is in destroying other joy
1	to me is lost then let me not let pass
1	occasion which now smiles behold alone
1	the woman opportune to all attempts 
1	her husband for i view far round not nigh 
1	whose higher intellectual more i shun 
1	and strength of courage haughty and of limb
1	heroick built though of terrestrial mould 
1	foe not informidable exempt from wound 
1	i not so much hath hell debased and pain
1	enfeebled me to what i was in heaven 
1	she fair divinely fair fit love for gods 
1	not terrible though terrour be in love
1	and beauty not approached by stronger hate 
1	hate stronger under show of love well feigned 
1	the way which to her ruin now i tend 
1	so spake the enemy of mankind enclosed
1	in serpent inmate bad and toward eve
1	addressed his way not with indented wave 
1	prone on the ground as since but on his rear 
1	circular base of rising folds that towered
1	fold above fold a surging maze his head
1	crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes 
1	with burnished neck of verdant gold erect
1	amidst his circling spires that on the grass
1	floated redundant pleasing was his shape
1	and lovely never since of serpent kind
1	lovelier not those that in illyria changed 
1	in epidaurus nor to which transformed
1	ammonian jove or capitoline was seen 
1	he with olympias this with her who bore
1	scipio the highth of rome with tract oblique
1	at first as one who sought access but feared
1	to interrupt side long he works his way 
1	as when a ship by skilful steersmen wrought
1	nigh river s mouth or foreland where the wind
1	veers oft as oft so steers and shifts her sail 
1	so varied he and of his tortuous train
1	curled many a wanton wreath in sight of eve 
1	to lure her eye she busied heard the sound
1	of rusling leaves but minded not as used
1	to such disport before her through the field 
1	from every beast more duteous at her call 
1	than at circean call the herd disguised 
1	he bolder now uncalled before her stood 
1	but as in gaze admiring oft he bowed
1	his turret crest and sleek enamelled neck 
1	fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod 
1	the eye of eve to mark his play he glad
1	of her attention gained with serpent tongue
1	organick or impulse of vocal air 
1	his fraudulent temptation thus began 
1	wonder not sovran mistress if perhaps
1	thou canst who art sole wonder much less arm
1	thy looks the heaven of mildness with disdain 
1	displeased that i approach thee thus and gaze
1	insatiate i thus single nor have feared
1	thy awful brow more awful thus retired 
1	fairest resemblance of thy maker fair 
1	thee all things living gaze on all things thine
1	by gift and thy celestial beauty adore
1	with ravishment beheld there best beheld 
1	where universally admired but here
1	in this enclosure wild these beasts among 
1	beholders rude and shallow to discern
1	half what in thee is fair one man except 
1	who sees thee and what is one who should be seen
1	a goddess among gods adored and served
1	by angels numberless thy daily train 
1	so glozed the tempter and his proem tuned 
1	into the heart of eve his words made way 
1	though at the voice much marvelling at length 
1	not unamazed she thus in answer spake 
1	what may this mean language of man pronounced
1	by tongue of brute and human sense expressed 
1	the first at least of these i thought denied
1	to beasts whom god on their creation day 
1	created mute to all articulate sound 
1	the latter i demur for in their looks
1	much reason and in their actions oft appears 
1	thee serpent subtlest beast of all the field
1	i knew but not with human voice endued 
1	redouble then this miracle and say 
1	how camest thou speakable of mute and how
1	to me so friendly grown above the rest
1	of brutal kind that daily are in sight 
1	say for such wonder claims attention due 
1	to whom the guileful tempter thus replied 
1	empress of this fair world resplendent eve 
1	easy to me it is to tell thee all
1	what thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed 
1	i was at first as other beasts that graze
1	the trodden herb of abject thoughts and low 
1	as was my food nor aught but food discerned
1	or sex and apprehended nothing high 
1	till on a day roving the field i chanced
1	a goodly tree far distant to behold
1	loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed 
1	ruddy and gold i nearer drew to gaze 
1	when from the boughs a savoury odour blown 
1	grateful to appetite more pleased my sense
1	than smell of sweetest fennel or the teats
1	of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even 
1	unsucked of lamb or kid that tend their play 
1	to satisfy the sharp desire i had
1	of tasting those fair apples i resolved
1	not to defer hunger and thirst at once 
1	powerful persuaders quickened at the scent
1	of that alluring fruit urged me so keen 
1	about the mossy trunk i wound me soon 
1	for high from ground the branches would require
1	thy utmost reach or adam s round the tree
1	all other beasts that saw with like desire
1	longing and envying stood but could not reach 
1	amid the tree now got where plenty hung
1	tempting so nigh to pluck and eat my fill
1	i spared not for such pleasure till that hour 
1	at feed or fountain never had i found 
1	sated at length ere long i might perceive
1	strange alteration in me to degree
1	of reason in my inward powers and speech
1	wanted not long though to this shape retained 
1	thenceforth to speculations high or deep
1	i turned my thoughts and with capacious mind
1	considered all things visible in heaven 
1	or earth or middle all things fair and good 
1	but all that fair and good in thy divine
1	semblance and in thy beauty s heavenly ray 
1	united i beheld no fair to thine
1	equivalent or second which compelled
1	me thus though importune perhaps to come
1	and gaze and worship thee of right declared
1	sovran of creatures universal dame 
1	so talked the spirited sly snake and eve 
1	yet more amazed unwary thus replied 
1	serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt
1	the virtue of that fruit in thee first proved 
1	but say where grows the tree from hence how far 
1	for many are the trees of god that grow
1	in paradise and various yet unknown
1	to us in such abundance lies our choice 
1	as leaves a greater store of fruit untouched 
1	still hanging incorruptible till men
1	grow up to their provision and more hands
1	help to disburden nature of her birth 
1	to whom the wily adder blithe and glad 
1	empress the way is ready and not long 
1	beyond a row of myrtles on a flat 
1	fast by a fountain one small thicket past
1	of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept
1	my conduct i can bring thee thither soon
1	lead then said eve he leading swiftly rolled
1	in tangles and made intricate seem straight 
1	to mischief swift hope elevates and joy
1	brightens his crest as when a wandering fire 
1	compact of unctuous vapour which the night
1	condenses and the cold environs round 
1	kindled through agitation to a flame 
1	which oft they say some evil spirit attends 
1	hovering and blazing with delusive light 
1	misleads the amazed night wanderer from his way
1	to bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool 
1	there swallowed up and lost from succour far 
1	so glistered the dire snake and into fraud
1	led eve our credulous mother to the tree
1	of prohibition root of all our woe 
1	which when she saw thus to her guide she spake 
1	serpent we might have spared our coming hither 
1	fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess 
1	the credit of whose virtue rest with thee 
1	wonderous indeed if cause of such effects 
1	but of this tree we may not taste nor touch 
1	god so commanded and left that command
1	sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
1	law to ourselves our reason is our law 
1	to whom the tempter guilefully replied 
1	indeed hath god then said that of the fruit
1	of all these garden trees ye shall not eat 
1	yet lords declared of all in earth or air 
1	to whom thus eve yet sinless of the fruit
1	of each tree in the garden we may eat 
1	but of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
1	the garden god hath said ye shall not eat
1	thereof nor shall ye touch it lest ye die 
1	she scarce had said though brief when now more bold
1	the tempter but with show of zeal and love
1	to man and indignation at his wrong 
1	new part puts on and as to passion moved 
1	fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act
1	raised as of some great matter to begin 
1	as when of old some orator renowned 
1	in athens or free rome where eloquence
1	flourished since mute to some great cause addressed 
1	stood in himself collected while each part 
1	motion each act won audience ere the tongue 
1	sometimes in highth began as no delay
1	of preface brooking through his zeal of right 
1	so standing moving or to highth up grown 
1	the tempter all impassioned thus began 
1	o sacred wise and wisdom giving plant 
1	mother of science now i feel thy power
1	within me clear not only to discern
1	things in their causes but to trace the ways
1	of highest agents deemed however wise 
1	queen of this universe do not believe
1	those rigid threats of death ye shall not die 
1	how should you by the fruit it gives you life
1	to knowledge by the threatener look on me 
1	me who have touched and tasted yet both live 
1	and life more perfect have attained than fate
1	meant me by venturing higher than my lot 
1	shall that be shut to man which to the beast
1	is open or will god incense his ire
1	for such a petty trespass and not praise
1	rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain
1	of death denounced whatever thing death be 
1	deterred not from achieving what might lead
1	to happier life knowledge of good and evil 
1	of good how just of evil if what is evil
1	be real why not known since easier shunned 
1	god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just 
1	not just not god not feared then nor obeyed 
1	your fear itself of death removes the fear 
1	why then was this forbid why but to awe 
1	why but to keep ye low and ignorant 
1	his worshippers he knows that in the day
1	ye eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear 
1	yet are but dim shall perfectly be then
1	opened and cleared and ye shall be as gods 
1	knowing both good and evil as they know 
1	that ye shall be as gods since i as man 
1	internal man is but proportion meet 
1	i of brute human ye of human gods 
1	so ye shall die perhaps by putting off
1	human to put on gods death to be wished 
1	though threatened which no worse than this can bring 
1	and what are gods that man may not become
1	as they participating god like food 
1	the gods are first and that advantage use
1	on our belief that all from them proceeds 
1	i question it for this fair earth i see 
1	warmed by the sun producing every kind 
1	them nothing if they all things who enclosed
1	knowledge of good and evil in this tree 
1	that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
1	wisdom without their leave and wherein lies
1	the offence that man should thus attain to know 
1	what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
1	impart against his will if all be his 
1	or is it envy and can envy dwell
1	in heavenly breasts these these and many more
1	causes import your need of this fair fruit 
1	goddess humane reach then and freely taste 
1	he ended and his words replete with guile 
1	into her heart too easy entrance won 
1	fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold
1	might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
1	yet rung of his persuasive words impregned
1	with reason to her seeming and with truth 
1	mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked
1	an eager appetite raised by the smell
1	so savoury of that fruit which with desire 
1	inclinable now grown to touch or taste 
1	solicited her longing eye yet first
1	pausing a while thus to herself she mused 
1	great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits 
1	though kept from man and worthy to be admired 
1	whose taste too long forborn at first assay
1	gave elocution to the mute and taught
1	the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise 
1	thy praise he also who forbids thy use 
1	conceals not from us naming thee the tree
1	of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil 
1	forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
1	commends thee more while it infers the good
1	by thee communicated and our want 
1	for good unknown sure is not had or had
1	and yet unknown is as not had at all 
1	in plain then what forbids he but to know 
1	forbids us good forbids us to be wise 
1	such prohibitions bind not but if death
1	bind us with after bands what profits then
1	our inward freedom in the day we eat
1	of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die 
1	how dies the serpent he hath eaten and lives 
1	and knows and speaks and reasons and discerns 
1	irrational till then for us alone
1	was death invented or to us denied
1	this intellectual food for beasts reserved 
1	for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
1	hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
1	the good befallen him author unsuspect 
1	friendly to man far from deceit or guile 
1	what fear i then rather what know to fear
1	under this ignorance of good and evil 
1	of god or death of law or penalty 
1	here grows the cure of all this fruit divine 
1	fair to the eye inviting to the taste 
1	of virtue to make wise what hinders then
1	of man s first disobedience and the fruit
1	to reach and feed at once both body and mind 
1	so saying her rash hand in evil hour
1	forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she eat 
1	earth felt the wound and nature from her seat 
1	sighing through all her works gave signs of woe 
1	that all was lost back to the thicket slunk
1	the guilty serpent and well might for eve 
1	intent now wholly on her taste nought else
1	regarded such delight till then as seemed 
1	in fruit she never tasted whether true
1	or fancied so through expectation high
1	of knowledge not was godhead from her thought 
1	greedily she ingorged without restraint 
1	and knew not eating death satiate at length 
1	and hightened as with wine jocund and boon 
1	thus to herself she pleasingly began 
1	o sovran virtuous precious of all trees
1	in paradise of operation blest
1	to sapience hitherto obscured infamed 
1	and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
1	created but henceforth my early care 
1	not without song each morning and due praise 
1	shall tend thee and the fertile burden ease
1	of thy full branches offered free to all 
1	till dieted by thee i grow mature
1	in knowledge as the gods who all things know 
1	though others envy what they cannot give 
1	for had the gift been theirs it had not here
1	thus grown experience next to thee i owe 
1	best guide not following thee i had remained
1	in ignorance thou openest wisdom s way 
1	and givest access though secret she retire 
1	and i perhaps am secret heaven is high 
1	high and remote to see from thence distinct
1	each thing on earth and other care perhaps
1	may have diverted from continual watch
1	our great forbidder safe with all his spies
1	about him but to adam in what sort
1	shall i appear shall i to him make known
1	as yet my change and give him to partake
1	full happiness with me or rather not 
1	but keeps the odds of knowledge in my power
1	without copartner so to add what wants
1	in female sex the more to draw his love 
1	and render me more equal and perhaps 
1	a thing not undesirable sometime
1	superiour for inferiour who is free
1	this may be well but what if god have seen 
1	and death ensue then i shall be no more 
1	and adam wedded to another eve 
1	shall live with her enjoying i extinct 
1	a death to think confirmed then i resolve 
1	adam shall share with me in bliss or woe 
1	so dear i love him that with him all deaths
1	i could endure without him live no life 
1	so saying from the tree her step she turned 
1	but first low reverence done as to the power
1	that dwelt within whose presence had infused
1	into the plant sciential sap derived
1	from nectar drink of gods adam the while 
1	waiting desirous her return had wove
1	of choicest flowers a garland to adorn
1	her tresses and her rural labours crown 
1	as reapers oft are wont their harvest queen 
1	great joy he promised to his thoughts and new
1	solace in her return so long delayed 
1	yet oft his heart divine of something ill 
1	misgave him he the faltering measure felt 
1	and forth to meet her went the way she took
1	that morn when first they parted by the tree
1	of knowledge he must pass there he her met 
1	scarce from the tree returning in her hand
1	a bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled 
1	new gathered and ambrosial smell diffused 
1	to him she hasted in her face excuse
1	came prologue and apology too prompt 
1	which with bland words at will she thus addressed 
1	hast thou not wondered adam at my stay 
1	thee i have missed and thought it long deprived
1	thy presence agony of love till now
1	not felt nor shall be twice for never more
1	mean i to try what rash untried i sought 
1	the pain of absence from thy sight but strange
1	hath been the cause and wonderful to hear 
1	this tree is not as we are told a tree
1	of danger tasted nor to evil unknown
1	opening the way but of divine effect
1	to open eyes and make them gods who taste 
1	and hath been tasted such the serpent wise 
1	or not restrained as we or not obeying 
1	hath eaten of the fruit and is become 
1	not dead as we are threatened but thenceforth
1	endued with human voice and human sense 
1	reasoning to admiration and with me
1	persuasively hath so prevailed that i
1	have also tasted and have also found
1	the effects to correspond opener mine eyes 
1	dim erst dilated spirits ampler heart 
1	and growing up to godhead which for thee
1	chiefly i sought without thee can despise 
1	for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss 
1	tedious unshared with thee and odious soon 
1	thou therefore also taste that equal lot
1	may join us equal joy as equal love 
1	lest thou not tasting different degree
1	disjoin us and i then too late renounce
1	deity for thee when fate will not permit 
1	thus eve with countenance blithe her story told 
1	but in her cheek distemper flushing glowed 
1	on the other side adam soon as he heard
1	the fatal trespass done by eve amazed 
1	astonied stood and blank while horrour chill
1	ran through his veins and all his joints relaxed 
1	from his slack hand the garland wreathed for eve
1	down dropt and all the faded roses shed 
1	speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
1	first to himself he inward silence broke 
1	o fairest of creation last and best
1	of all god s works creature in whom excelled
1	whatever can to sight or thought be formed 
1	holy divine good amiable or sweet 
1	how art thou lost how on a sudden lost 
1	defaced deflowered and now to death devote 
1	rather how hast thou yielded to transgress
1	the strict forbiddance how to violate
1	the sacred fruit forbidden some cursed fraud
1	of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown 
1	and me with thee hath ruined for with thee
1	certain my resolution is to die 
1	how can i live without thee how forego
1	thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined 
1	to live again in these wild woods forlorn 
1	should god create another eve and i
1	another rib afford yet loss of thee
1	would never from my heart no no i feel
1	the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh 
1	bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
1	mine never shall be parted bliss or woe 
1	so having said as one from sad dismay
1	recomforted and after thoughts disturbed
1	submitting to what seemed remediless 
1	thus in calm mood his words to eve he turned 
1	bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous eve 
1	and peril great provoked who thus hast dared 
1	had it been only coveting to eye
1	that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence 
1	much more to taste it under ban to touch 
1	but past who can recall or done undo 
1	perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
1	is not so heinous now foretasted fruit 
1	profaned first by the serpent by him first
1	made common and unhallowed ere our taste 
1	nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives 
1	lives as thou saidst and gains to live as man 
1	higher degree of life inducement strong
1	to us as likely tasting to attain
1	proportional ascent which cannot be
1	but to be gods or angels demi gods 
1	nor can i think that god creator wise 
1	though threatening will in earnest so destroy
1	us his prime creatures dignified so high 
1	set over all his works which in our fall 
1	for us created needs with us must fail 
1	dependant made so god shall uncreate 
1	be frustrate do undo and labour lose 
1	not well conceived of god who though his power
1	creation could repeat yet would be loth
1	us to abolish lest the adversary
1	triumph and say fickle their state whom god
1	most favours who can please him long me first
1	he ruined now mankind whom will he next 
1	matter of scorn not to be given the foe 
1	however i with thee have fixed my lot 
1	certain to undergo like doom if death
1	consort with thee death is to me as life 
1	so forcible within my heart i feel
1	the bond of nature draw me to my own 
1	my own in thee for what thou art is mine 
1	our state cannot be severed we are one 
1	one flesh to lose thee were to lose myself 
1	so adam and thus eve to him replied 
1	o glorious trial of exceeding love 
1	illustrious evidence example high 
1	engaging me to emulate but short
1	of thy perfection how shall i attain 
1	adam from whose dear side i boast me sprung 
1	and gladly of our union hear thee speak 
1	one heart one soul in both whereof good proof
1	this day affords declaring thee resolved 
1	rather than death or aught than death more dread 
1	shall separate us linked in love so dear 
1	to undergo with me one guilt one crime 
1	if any be of tasting this fair fruit 
1	whose virtue for of good still good proceeds 
1	direct or by occasion hath presented
1	this happy trial of thy love which else
1	so eminently never had been known 
1	were it i thought death menaced would ensue
1	this my attempt i would sustain alone
1	the worst and not persuade thee rather die
1	deserted than oblige thee with a fact
1	pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured
1	remarkably so late of thy so true 
1	so faithful love unequalled but i feel
1	far otherwise the event not death but life
1	augmented opened eyes new hopes new joys 
1	taste so divine that what of sweet before
1	hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh 
1	on my experience adam freely taste 
1	and fear of death deliver to the winds 
1	so saying she embraced him and for joy
1	tenderly wept much won that he his love
1	had so ennobled as of choice to incur
1	divine displeasure for her sake or death 
1	in recompence for such compliance bad
1	such recompence best merits from the bough
1	she gave him of that fair enticing fruit
1	with liberal hand he scrupled not to eat 
1	against his better knowledge not deceived 
1	but fondly overcome with female charm 
1	earth trembled from her entrails as again
1	in pangs and nature gave a second groan 
1	sky loured and muttering thunder some sad drops
1	wept at completing of the mortal sin
1	original while adam took no thought 
1	eating his fill nor eve to iterate
1	her former trespass feared the more to sooth
1	him with her loved society that now 
1	as with new wine intoxicated both 
1	they swim in mirth and fancy that they feel
1	divinity within them breeding wings 
1	wherewith to scorn the earth but that false fruit
1	far other operation first displayed 
1	carnal desire inflaming he on eve
1	began to cast lascivious eyes she him
1	as wantonly repaid in lust they burn 
1	till adam thus gan eve to dalliance move 
1	eve now i see thou art exact of taste 
1	and elegant of sapience no small part 
1	since to each meaning savour we apply 
1	and palate call judicious i the praise
1	yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed 
1	much pleasure we have lost while we abstained
1	from this delightful fruit nor known till now
1	true relish tasting if such pleasure be
1	in things to us forbidden it might be wished 
1	for this one tree had been forbidden ten 
1	but come so well refreshed now let us play 
1	as meet is after such delicious fare 
1	for never did thy beauty since the day
1	i saw thee first and wedded thee adorned
1	with all perfections so inflame my sense
1	with ardour to enjoy thee fairer now
1	than ever bounty of this virtuous tree 
1	so said he and forbore not glance or toy
1	of amorous intent well understood
1	of eve whose eye darted contagious fire 
1	her hand he seised and to a shady bank 
1	thick over head with verdant roof imbowered 
1	he led her nothing loth flowers were the couch 
1	pansies and violets and asphodel 
1	and hyacinth earth s freshest softest lap 
1	there they their fill of love and love s disport
1	took largely of their mutual guilt the seal 
1	the solace of their sin till dewy sleep
1	oppressed them wearied with their amorous play 
1	soon as the force of that fallacious fruit 
1	that with exhilarating vapour bland
1	about their spirits had played and inmost powers
1	made err was now exhaled and grosser sleep 
1	bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
1	incumbered now had left them up they rose
1	as from unrest and each the other viewing 
1	soon found their eyes how opened and their minds
1	how darkened innocence that as a veil
1	had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone 
1	just confidence and native righteousness 
1	and honour from about them naked left
1	to guilty shame he covered but his robe
1	uncovered more so rose the danite strong 
1	herculean samson from the harlot lap
1	of philistean dalilah and waked
1	shorn of his strength they destitute and bare
1	of all their virtue silent and in face
1	confounded long they sat as strucken mute 
1	till adam though not less than eve abashed 
1	at length gave utterance to these words constrained 
1	o eve in evil hour thou didst give ear
1	to that false worm of whomsoever taught
1	to counterfeit man s voice true in our fall 
1	false in our promised rising since our eyes
1	opened we find indeed and find we know
1	both good and evil good lost and evil got 
1	bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know 
1	which leaves us naked thus of honour void 
1	of innocence of faith of purity 
1	our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained 
1	and in our faces evident the signs
1	of foul concupiscence whence evil store 
1	even shame the last of evils of the first
1	be sure then how shall i behold the face
1	henceforth of god or angel erst with joy
1	and rapture so oft beheld those heavenly shapes
1	will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze
1	insufferably bright o might i here
1	in solitude live savage in some glade
1	obscured where highest woods impenetrable
1	to star or sun light spread their umbrage broad
1	and brown as evening cover me ye pines 
1	ye cedars with innumerable boughs
1	hide me where i may never see them more 
1	but let us now as in bad plight devise
1	what best may for the present serve to hide
1	the parts of each from other that seem most
1	to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen 
1	some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sewed 
1	and girded on our loins may cover round
1	those middle parts that this new comer shame 
1	there sit not and reproach us as unclean 
1	so counselled he and both together went
1	into the thickest wood there soon they chose
1	the fig tree not that kind for fruit renowned 
1	but such as at this day to indians known 
1	in malabar or decan spreads her arms
1	branching so broad and long that in the ground
1	the bended twigs take root and daughters grow
1	about the mother tree a pillared shade
1	high over arched and echoing walks between 
1	there oft the indian herdsman shunning heat 
1	shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds
1	at loop holes cut through thickest shade those leaves
1	they gathered broad as amazonian targe 
1	and with what skill they had together sewed 
1	to gird their waist vain covering if to hide
1	their guilt and dreaded shame o how unlike
1	to that first naked glory such of late
1	columbus found the american so girt
1	with feathered cincture naked else and wild
1	among the trees on isles and woody shores 
1	thus fenced and as they thought their shame in part
1	covered but not at rest or ease of mind 
1	they sat them down to weep nor only tears
1	rained at their eyes but high winds worse within
1	began to rise high passions anger hate 
1	mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore
1	their inward state of mind calm region once
1	and full of peace now tost and turbulent 
1	for understanding ruled not and the will
1	heard not her lore both in subjection now
1	to sensual appetite who from beneath
1	usurping over sovran reason claimed
1	superiour sway from thus distempered breast 
1	adam estranged in look and altered style 
1	speech intermitted thus to eve renewed 
1	would thou hadst hearkened to my words and staid
1	with me as i besought thee when that strange
1	desire of wandering this unhappy morn 
1	i know not whence possessed thee we had then
1	remained still happy not as now despoiled
1	of all our good shamed naked miserable 
1	let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
1	the faith they owe when earnestly they seek
1	such proof conclude they then begin to fail 
1	to whom soon moved with touch of blame thus eve 
1	what words have passed thy lips adam severe 
1	imputest thou that to my default or will
1	of wandering as thou callest it which who knows
1	but might as ill have happened thou being by 
1	or to thyself perhaps hadst thou been there 
1	or here the attempt thou couldst not have discerned
1	fraud in the serpent speaking as he spake 
1	no ground of enmity between us known 
1	why he should mean me ill or seek to harm 
1	was i to have never parted from thy side 
1	as good have grown there still a lifeless rib 
1	being as i am why didst not thou the head 
1	command me absolutely not to go 
1	going into such danger as thou saidst 
1	too facile then thou didst not much gainsay 
1	nay didst permit approve and fair dismiss 
1	hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent 
1	neither had i transgressed nor thou with me 
1	to whom then first incensed adam replied 
1	is this the love is this the recompence
1	of mine to thee ingrateful eve expressed
1	immutable when thou wert lost not i 
1	who might have lived and joyed immortal bliss 
1	yet willingly chose rather death with thee 
1	and am i now upbraided as the cause
1	of thy transgressing not enough severe 
1	it seems in thy restraint what could i more
1	i warned thee i admonished thee foretold
1	the danger and the lurking enemy
1	that lay in wait beyond this had been force 
1	and force upon free will hath here no place 
1	but confidence then bore thee on secure
1	either to meet no danger or to find
1	matter of glorious trial and perhaps
1	i also erred in overmuch admiring
1	what seemed in thee so perfect that i thought
1	no evil durst attempt thee but i rue
1	the errour now which is become my crime 
1	and thou the accuser thus it shall befall
1	him who to worth in women overtrusting 
1	lets her will rule restraint she will not brook 
1	and left to herself if evil thence ensue 
1	she first his weak indulgence will accuse 
1	thus they in mutual accusation spent
1	the fruitless hours but neither self condemning 
1	and of their vain contest appeared no end 
1	mean while the heinous and despiteful act
1	of satan done in paradise and how
1	he in the serpent had perverted eve 
1	her husband she to taste the fatal fruit 
1	was known in heaven for what can scape the eye
1	of god all seeing or deceive his heart
1	omniscient who in all things wise and just 
1	hindered not satan to attempt the mind
1	of man with strength entire and free will armed 
1	complete to have discovered and repulsed
1	whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend 
1	for still they knew and ought to have still remembered 
1	the high injunction not to taste that fruit 
1	whoever tempted which they not obeying 
1	 incurred what could they less the penalty 
1	and manifold in sin deserved to fall 
1	up into heaven from paradise in haste
1	the angelick guards ascended mute and sad 
1	for man for of his state by this they knew 
1	much wondering how the subtle fiend had stolen
1	entrance unseen soon as the unwelcome news
1	from earth arrived at heaven gate displeased
1	all were who heard dim sadness did not spare
1	that time celestial visages yet mixed
1	with pity violated not their bliss 
1	about the new arrived in multitudes
1	the ethereal people ran to hear and know
1	how all befel they towards the throne supreme 
1	accountable made haste to make appear 
1	with righteous plea their utmost vigilance
1	and easily approved when the most high
1	eternal father from his secret cloud 
1	amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice 
1	assembled angels and ye powers returned
1	from unsuccessful charge be not dismayed 
1	nor troubled at these tidings from the earth 
1	which your sincerest care could not prevent 
1	foretold so lately what would come to pass 
1	when first this tempter crossed the gulf from hell 
1	i told ye then he should prevail and speed
1	on his bad errand man should be seduced 
1	and flattered out of all believing lies
1	against his maker no decree of mine
1	concurring to necessitate his fall 
1	or touch with lightest moment of impulse
1	his free will to her own inclining left
1	in even scale but fallen he is and now
1	what rests but that the mortal sentence pass
1	on his transgression death denounced that day 
1	which he presumes already vain and void 
1	because not yet inflicted as he feared 
1	by some immediate stroke but soon shall find
1	forbearance no acquittance ere day end 
1	justice shall not return as bounty scorned 
1	but whom send i to judge them whom but thee 
1	vicegerent son to thee i have transferred
1	all judgement whether in heaven or earth or hell 
1	easy it may be seen that i intend
1	mercy colleague with justice sending thee
1	man s friend his mediator his designed
1	both ransom and redeemer voluntary 
1	and destined man himself to judge man fallen 
1	so spake the father and unfolding bright
1	toward the right hand his glory on the son
1	blazed forth unclouded deity he full
1	resplendent all his father manifest
1	expressed and thus divinely answered mild 
1	father eternal thine is to decree 
1	mine both in heaven and earth to do thy will
1	supreme that thou in me thy son beloved 
1	mayest ever rest well pleased i go to judge
1	on earth these thy transgressours but thou knowest 
1	whoever judged the worst on me must light 
1	when time shall be for so i undertook
1	before thee and not repenting this obtain
1	of right that i may mitigate their doom
1	on me derived yet i shall temper so
1	justice with mercy as may illustrate most
1	them fully satisfied and thee appease 
1	attendance none shall need nor train where none
1	are to behold the judgement but the judged 
1	those two the third best absent is condemned 
1	convict by flight and rebel to all law 
1	conviction to the serpent none belongs 
1	thus saying from his radiant seat he rose
1	of high collateral glory him thrones and powers 
1	princedoms and dominations ministrant 
1	accompanied to heaven gate from whence
1	eden and all the coast in prospect lay 
1	down he descended straight the speed of gods
1	time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged 
1	now was the sun in western cadence low
1	from noon and gentle airs due at their hour 
1	to fan the earth now waked and usher in
1	the evening cool when he from wrath more cool 
1	came the mild judge and intercessour both 
1	to sentence man the voice of god they heard
1	now walking in the garden by soft winds
1	brought to their ears while day declined they heard 
1	and from his presence hid themselves among
1	the thickest trees both man and wife till god 
1	approaching thus to adam called aloud 
1	where art thou adam wont with joy to meet
1	my coming seen far off i miss thee here 
1	not pleased thus entertained with solitude 
1	where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought 
1	or come i less conspicuous or what change
1	absents thee or what chance detains come forth 
1	he came and with him eve more loth though first
1	to offend discountenanced both and discomposed 
1	love was not in their looks either to god 
1	or to each other but apparent guilt 
1	and shame and perturbation and despair 
1	anger and obstinacy and hate and guile 
1	whence adam faltering long thus answered brief 
1	i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
1	afraid being naked hid myself to whom
1	the gracious judge without revile replied 
1	my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not feared 
1	but still rejoiced how is it now become
1	so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who
1	hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree 
1	whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat 
1	to whom thus adam sore beset replied 
1	o heaven in evil strait this day i stand
1	before my judge either to undergo
1	myself the total crime or to accuse
1	my other self the partner of my life 
1	whose failing while her faith to me remains 
1	i should conceal and not expose to blame
1	by my complaint but strict necessity
1	subdues me and calamitous constraint 
1	lest on my head both sin and punishment 
1	however insupportable be all
1	devolved though should i hold my peace yet thou
1	wouldst easily detect what i conceal 
1	this woman whom thou madest to be my help 
1	and gavest me as thy perfect gift so good 
1	so fit so acceptable so divine 
1	that from her hand i could suspect no ill 
1	and what she did whatever in itself 
1	her doing seemed to justify the deed 
1	she gave me of the tree and i did eat 
1	to whom the sovran presence thus replied 
1	was she thy god that her thou didst obey
1	before his voice or was she made thy guide 
1	superiour or but equal that to her
1	thou didst resign thy manhood and the place
1	wherein god set thee above her made of thee 
1	and for thee whose perfection far excelled
1	hers in all real dignity adorned
1	she was indeed and lovely to attract
1	thy love not thy subjection and her gifts
1	were such as under government well seemed 
1	unseemly to bear rule which was thy part
1	and person hadst thou known thyself aright 
1	so having said he thus to eve in few 
1	say woman what is this which thou hast done 
1	to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelmed 
1	confessing soon yet not before her judge
1	bold or loquacious thus abashed replied 
1	the serpent me beguiled and i did eat 
1	which when the lord god heard without delay
1	to judgement he proceeded on the accused
1	serpent though brute unable to transfer
1	the guilt on him who made him instrument
1	of mischief and polluted from the end
1	of his creation justly then accursed 
1	as vitiated in nature more to know
1	concerned not man since he no further knew 
1	nor altered his offence yet god at last
1	to satan first in sin his doom applied 
1	though in mysterious terms judged as then best 
1	and on the serpent thus his curse let fall 
1	because thou hast done this thou art accursed
1	above all cattle each beast of the field 
1	upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go 
1	and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life 
1	between thee and the woman i will put
1	enmity and between thine and her seed 
1	her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel 
1	so spake this oracle then verified
1	when jesus son of mary second eve 
1	saw satan fall like lightning down from heaven 
1	prince of the air then rising from his grave
1	spoiled principalities and powers triumphed
1	in open show and with ascension bright 
1	captivity led captive through the air 
1	the realm itself of satan long usurped 
1	whom he shall tread at last under our feet 
1	even he who now foretold his fatal bruise 
1	and to the woman thus his sentence turned 
1	thy sorrow i will greatly multiply
1	by thy conception children thou shalt bring
1	in sorrow forth and to thy husband s will
1	thine shall submit he over thee shall rule 
1	on adam last thus judgement he pronounced 
1	because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife 
1	and eaten of the tree concerning which
1	i charged thee saying thou shalt not eat thereof 
1	cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
1	shalt eat thereof all the days of thy life 
1	thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
1	unbid and thou shalt eat the herb of the field 
1	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread 
1	till thou return unto the ground for thou
1	out of the ground wast taken know thy birth 
1	for dust thou art and shalt to dust return 
1	so judged he man both judge and saviour sent 
1	and the instant stroke of death denounced that day 
1	removed far off then pitying how they stood
1	before him naked to the air that now
1	must suffer change disdained not to begin
1	thenceforth the form of servant to assume 
1	as when he washed his servants feet so now 
1	as father of his family he clad
1	their nakedness with skins of beasts or slain 
1	or as the snake with youthful coat repaid 
1	and thought not much to clothe his enemies 
1	nor he their outward only with the skins
1	of beasts but inward nakedness much more 
1	opprobrious with his robe of righteousness 
1	arraying covered from his father s sight 
1	to him with swift ascent he up returned 
1	into his blissful bosom reassumed
1	in glory as of old to him appeased
1	all though all knowing what had passed with man
1	recounted mixing intercession sweet 
1	mean while ere thus was sinned and judged on earth 
1	within the gates of hell sat sin and death 
1	in counterview within the gates that now
1	stood open wide belching outrageous flame
1	far into chaos since the fiend passed through 
1	sin opening who thus now to death began 
1	o son why sit we here each other viewing
1	idly while satan our great author thrives
1	in other worlds and happier seat provides
1	for us his offspring dear it cannot be
1	but that success attends him if mishap 
1	ere this he had returned with fury driven
1	by his avengers since no place like this
1	can fit his punishment or their revenge 
1	methinks i feel new strength within me rise 
1	wings growing and dominion given me large
1	beyond this deep whatever draws me on 
1	or sympathy or some connatural force 
1	powerful at greatest distance to unite 
1	with secret amity things of like kind 
1	by secretest conveyance thou my shade
1	inseparable must with me along 
1	for death from sin no power can separate 
1	but lest the difficulty of passing back
1	stay his return perhaps over this gulf
1	impassable impervious let us try
1	adventurous work yet to thy power and mine
1	not unagreeable to found a path
1	over this main from hell to that new world 
1	where satan now prevails a monument
1	of merit high to all the infernal host 
1	easing their passage hence for intercourse 
1	or transmigration as their lot shall lead 
1	nor can i miss the way so strongly drawn
1	by this new felt attraction and instinct 
1	whom thus the meager shadow answered soon 
1	go whither fate and inclination strong 
1	leads thee i shall not lag behind nor err
1	the way thou leading such a scent i draw
1	of carnage prey innumerable and taste
1	the savour of death from all things there that live 
1	nor shall i to the work thou enterprisest
1	be wanting but afford thee equal aid 
1	so saying with delight he snuffed the smell
1	of mortal change on earth as when a flock
1	of ravenous fowl though many a league remote 
1	against the day of battle to a field 
1	where armies lie encamped come flying lured
1	with scent of living carcasses designed
1	for death the following day in bloody fight 
1	so scented the grim feature and upturned
1	his nostril wide into the murky air 
1	sagacious of his quarry from so far 
1	then both from out hell gates into the waste
1	wide anarchy of chaos damp and dark 
1	flew diverse and with power their power was great 
1	hovering upon the waters what they met
1	solid or slimy as in raging sea
1	tost up and down together crouded drove 
1	from each side shoaling towards the mouth of hell 
1	as when two polar winds blowing adverse
1	upon the cronian sea together drive
1	mountains of ice that stop the imagined way
1	beyond petsora eastward to the rich
1	cathaian coast the aggregated soil
1	death with his mace petrifick cold and dry 
1	as with a trident smote and fixed as firm
1	as delos floating once the rest his look
1	bound with gorgonian rigour not to move 
1	and with asphaltick slime broad as the gate 
1	deep to the roots of hell the gathered beach
1	they fastened and the mole immense wrought on
1	over the foaming deep high arched a bridge
1	of length prodigious joining to the wall
1	immoveable of this now fenceless world 
1	forfeit to death from hence a passage broad 
1	smooth easy inoffensive down to hell 
1	so if great things to small may be compared 
1	xerxes the liberty of greece to yoke 
1	from susa his memnonian palace high 
1	came to the sea and over hellespont
1	bridging his way europe with asia joined 
1	and scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves 
1	now had they brought the work by wonderous art
1	pontifical a ridge of pendant rock 
1	over the vexed abyss following the track
1	of satan to the self same place where he
1	first lighted from his wing and landed safe
1	from out of chaos to the outside bare
1	of this round world with pins of adamant
1	and chains they made all fast too fast they made
1	and durable and now in little space
1	the confines met of empyrean heaven 
1	and of this world and on the left hand hell
1	with long reach interposed three several ways
1	in sight to each of these three places led 
1	and now their way to earth they had descried 
1	to paradise first tending when behold 
1	satan in likeness of an angel bright 
1	betwixt the centaur and the scorpion steering
1	his zenith while the sun in aries rose 
1	disguised he came but those his children dear
1	their parent soon discerned though in disguise 
1	he after eve seduced unminded slunk
1	into the wood fast by and changing shape 
1	to observe the sequel saw his guileful act
1	by eve though all unweeting seconded
1	upon her husband saw their shame that sought
1	vain covertures but when he saw descend
1	the son of god to judge them terrified
1	he fled not hoping to escape but shun
1	the present fearing guilty what his wrath
1	might suddenly inflict that past returned
1	by night and listening where the hapless pair
1	sat in their sad discourse and various plaint 
1	thence gathered his own doom which understood
1	not instant but of future time with joy
1	and tidings fraught to hell he now returned 
1	and at the brink of chaos near the foot
1	of this new wonderous pontifice unhoped
1	met who to meet him came his offspring dear 
1	great joy was at their meeting and at sight
1	of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased 
1	long he admiring stood till sin his fair
1	enchanting daughter thus the silence broke 
1	o parent these are thy magnifick deeds 
1	thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own 
1	thou art their author and prime architect 
1	for i no sooner in my heart divined 
1	my heart which by a secret harmony
1	still moves with thine joined in connexion sweet 
1	that thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks
1	now also evidence but straight i felt 
1	though distant from thee worlds between yet felt 
1	that i must after thee with this thy son 
1	such fatal consequence unites us three 
1	hell could no longer hold us in our bounds 
1	nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure
1	detain from following thy illustrious track 
1	thou hast achieved our liberty confined
1	within hell gates till now thou us impowered
1	to fortify thus far and overlay 
1	with this portentous bridge the dark abyss 
1	thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won
1	what thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained
1	with odds what war hath lost and fully avenged
1	our foil in heaven here thou shalt monarch reign 
1	there didst not there let him still victor sway 
1	as battle hath adjudged from this new world
1	retiring by his own doom alienated 
1	and henceforth monarchy with thee divide
1	of all things parted by the empyreal bounds 
1	his quadrature from thy orbicular world 
1	or try thee now more dangerous to his throne 
1	whom thus the prince of darkness answered glad 
1	fair daughter and thou son and grandchild both 
1	high proof ye now have given to be the race
1	of satan for i glory in the name 
1	antagonist of heaven s almighty king 
1	amply have merited of me of all
1	the infernal empire that so near heaven s door
1	triumphal with triumphal act have met 
1	mine with this glorious work and made one realm 
1	hell and this world one realm one continent
1	of easy thorough fare therefore while i
1	descend through darkness on your road with ease 
1	to my associate powers them to acquaint
1	with these successes and with them rejoice 
1	you two this way among these numerous orbs 
1	all yours right down to paradise descend 
1	there dwell and reign in bliss thence on the earth
1	dominion exercise and in the air 
1	chiefly on man sole lord of all declared 
1	him first make sure your thrall and lastly kill 
1	my substitutes i send ye and create
1	plenipotent on earth of matchless might
1	issuing from me on your joint vigour now
1	my hold of this new kingdom all depends 
1	through sin to death exposed by my exploit 
1	if your joint power prevail the affairs of hell
1	no detriment need fear go and be strong 
1	so saying he dismissed them they with speed
1	their course through thickest constellations held 
1	spreading their bane the blasted stars looked wan 
1	and planets planet struck real eclipse
1	then suffered the other way satan went down
1	the causey to hell gate on either side
1	disparted chaos overbuilt exclaimed 
1	and with rebounding surge the bars assailed 
1	that scorned his indignation through the gate 
1	wide open and unguarded satan passed 
1	and all about found desolate for those 
1	appointed to sit there had left their charge 
1	flown to the upper world the rest were all
1	far to the inland retired about the walls
1	of pandemonium city and proud seat
1	of lucifer so by allusion called
1	of that bright star to satan paragoned 
1	there kept their watch the legions while the grand
1	in council sat solicitous what chance
1	might intercept their emperour sent so he
1	departing gave command and they observed 
1	as when the tartar from his russian foe 
1	by astracan over the snowy plains 
1	retires or bactrin sophi from the horns
1	of turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond
1	the realm of aladule in his retreat
1	to tauris or casbeen so these the late
1	heaven banished host left desart utmost hell
1	many a dark league reduced in careful watch
1	round their metropolis and now expecting
1	each hour their great adventurer from the search
1	of foreign worlds he through the midst unmarked 
1	in show plebeian angel militant
1	of lowest order passed and from the door
1	of that plutonian hall invisible
1	ascended his high throne which under state
1	of richest texture spread at the upper end
1	was placed in regal lustre down a while
1	he sat and round about him saw unseen 
1	at last as from a cloud his fulgent head
1	and shape star bright appeared or brighter clad
1	with what permissive glory since his fall
1	was left him or false glitter all amazed
1	at that so sudden blaze the stygian throng
1	bent their aspect and whom they wished beheld 
1	their mighty chief returned loud was the acclaim 
1	forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers 
1	raised from their dark divan and with like joy
1	congratulant approached him who with hand
1	silence and with these words attention won 
1	for in possession such not only of right 
1	i call ye and declare ye now returned
1	successful beyond hope to lead ye forth
1	triumphant out of this infernal pit
1	abominable accursed the house of woe 
1	and dungeon of our tyrant now possess 
1	as lords a spacious world to our native heaven
1	little inferiour by my adventure hard
1	with peril great achieved long were to tell
1	what i have done what suffered with what pain
1	voyaged th unreal vast unbounded deep
1	of horrible confusion over which
1	by sin and death a broad way now is paved 
1	to expedite your glorious march but i
1	toiled out my uncouth passage forced to ride
1	the untractable abyss plunged in the womb
1	of unoriginal night and chaos wild 
1	that jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed
1	my journey strange with clamorous uproar
1	protesting fate supreme thence how i found
1	the new created world which fame in heaven
1	long had foretold a fabrick wonderful
1	of absolute perfection therein man
1	placed in a paradise by our exile
1	made happy him by fraud i have seduced
1	from his creator and the more to encrease
1	your wonder with an apple he thereat
1	offended worth your laughter hath given up
1	both his beloved man and all his world 
1	to sin and death a prey and so to us 
1	without our hazard labour or alarm 
1	to range in and to dwell and over man
1	to rule as over all he should have ruled 
1	true is me also he hath judged or rather
1	me not but the brute serpent in whose shape
1	man i deceived that which to me belongs 
1	is enmity which he will put between
1	me and mankind i am to bruise his heel 
1	his seed when is not set shall bruise my head 
1	a world who would not purchase with a bruise 
1	or much more grievous pain ye have the account
1	of my performance what remains ye gods 
1	but up and enter now into full bliss 
1	so having said a while he stood expecting
1	their universal shout and high applause 
1	to fill his ear when contrary he hears
1	on all sides from innumerable tongues 
1	a dismal universal hiss the sound
1	of publick scorn he wondered but not long
1	had leisure wondering at himself now more 
1	his visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare 
1	his arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining
1	each other till supplanted down he fell
1	a monstrous serpent on his belly prone 
1	reluctant but in vain a greater power
1	now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned 
1	according to his doom he would have spoke 
1	but hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
1	to forked tongue for now were all transformed
1	alike to serpents all as accessories
1	to his bold riot dreadful was the din
1	of hissing through the hall thick swarming now
1	with complicated monsters head and tail 
1	scorpion and asp and amphisbaena dire 
1	cerastes horned hydrus and elops drear 
1	and dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil
1	bedropt with blood of gorgon or the isle
1	ophiusa but still greatest he the midst 
1	now dragon grown larger than whom the sun
1	ingendered in the pythian vale or slime 
1	huge python and his power no less he seemed
1	above the rest still to retain they all
1	him followed issuing forth to the open field 
1	where all yet left of that revolted rout 
1	heaven fallen in station stood or just array 
1	sublime with expectation when to see
1	in triumph issuing forth their glorious chief 
1	they saw but other sight instead a croud
1	of ugly serpents horrour on them fell 
1	and horrid sympathy for what they saw 
1	they felt themselves now changing down their arms 
1	down fell both spear and shield down they as fast 
1	and the dire hiss renewed and the dire form
1	catched by contagion like in punishment 
1	as in their crime thus was the applause they meant 
1	turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame
1	cast on themselves from their own mouths there stood
1	a grove hard by sprung up with this their change 
1	his will who reigns above to aggravate
1	their penance laden with fair fruit like that
1	which grew in paradise the bait of eve
1	used by the tempter on that prospect strange
1	their earnest eyes they fixed imagining
1	for one forbidden tree a multitude
1	now risen to work them further woe or shame 
1	yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce 
1	though to delude them sent could not abstain 
1	but on they rolled in heaps and up the trees
1	climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks
1	that curled megaera greedily they plucked
1	the fruitage fair to sight like that which grew
1	near that bituminous lake where sodom flamed 
1	this more delusive not the touch but taste
1	deceived they fondly thinking to allay
1	their appetite with gust instead of fruit
1	chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste
1	with spattering noise rejected oft they assayed 
1	hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft 
1	with hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws 
1	with soot and cinders filled so oft they fell
1	into the same illusion not as man
1	whom they triumphed once lapsed thus were they plagued
1	and worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss 
1	till their lost shape permitted they resumed 
1	yearly enjoined some say to undergo 
1	this annual humbling certain numbered days 
1	to dash their pride and joy for man seduced 
1	however some tradition they dispersed
1	among the heathen of their purchase got 
1	and fabled how the serpent whom they called
1	ophion with eurynome the wide 
1	encroaching eve perhaps had first the rule
1	of high olympus thence by saturn driven
1	and ops ere yet dictaean jove was born 
1	mean while in paradise the hellish pair
1	too soon arrived sin there in power before 
1	once actual now in body and to dwell
1	habitual habitant behind her death 
1	close following pace for pace not mounted yet
1	on his pale horse to whom sin thus began 
1	second of satan sprung all conquering death 
1	what thinkest thou of our empire now though earned
1	with travel difficult not better far
1	than still at hell s dark threshold to have sat watch 
1	unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved 
1	whom thus the sin born monster answered soon 
1	to me who with eternal famine pine 
1	there best where most with ravine i may meet 
1	which here though plenteous all too little seems
1	to stuff this maw this vast unhide bound corps 
1	to whom the incestuous mother thus replied 
1	thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers 
1	feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl 
1	no homely morsels and whatever thing
1	the sithe of time mows down devour unspared 
1	till i in man residing through the race 
1	his thoughts his looks words actions all infect 
1	and season him thy last and sweetest prey 
1	this said they both betook them several ways 
1	both to destroy or unimmortal make
1	all kinds and for destruction to mature
1	sooner or later which the almighty seeing 
1	from his transcendent seat the saints among 
1	to those bright orders uttered thus his voice 
1	see with what heat these dogs of hell advance
1	to waste and havock yonder world which i
1	so fair and good created and had still
1	kept in that state had not the folly of man
1	let in these wasteful furies who impute
1	folly to me so doth the prince of hell
1	and his adherents that with so much ease
1	i suffer them to enter and possess
1	a place so heavenly and conniving seem
1	to gratify my scornful enemies 
1	that laugh as if transported with some fit
1	of passion i to them had quitted all 
1	at random yielded up to their misrule 
1	and know not that i called and drew them thither 
1	my hell hounds to lick up the draff and filth
1	which man s polluting sin with taint hath shed
1	on what was pure til crammed and gorged nigh burst
1	with sucked and glutted offal at one sling
1	of thy victorious arm well pleasing son 
1	both sin and death and yawning grave at last 
1	through chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of hell
1	for ever and seal up his ravenous jaws 
1	then heaven and earth renewed shall be made pure
1	to sanctity that shall receive no stain 
1	till then the curse pronounced on both precedes 
1	he ended and the heavenly audience loud
1	sung halleluiah as the sound of seas 
1	through multitude that sung just are thy ways 
1	righteous are thy decrees on all thy works 
1	who can extenuate thee next to the son 
1	destined restorer of mankind by whom
1	new heaven and earth shall to the ages rise 
1	or down from heaven descend such was their song 
1	while the creator calling forth by name
1	his mighty angels gave them several charge 
1	as sorted best with present things the sun
1	had first his precept so to move so shine 
1	as might affect the earth with cold and heat
1	scarce tolerable and from the north to call
1	decrepit winter from the south to bring
1	solstitial summer s heat to the blanc moon
1	her office they prescribed to the other five
1	their planetary motions and aspects 
1	in sextile square and trine and opposite 
1	of noxious efficacy and when to join
1	in synod unbenign and taught the fixed
1	their influence malignant when to shower 
1	which of them rising with the sun or falling 
1	should prove tempestuous to the winds they set
1	their corners when with bluster to confound
1	sea air and shore the thunder when to roll
1	with terrour through the dark aereal hall 
1	some say he bid his angels turn ascanse
1	the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more 
1	from the sun s axle they with labour pushed
1	oblique the centrick globe some say the sun
1	was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
1	like distant breadth to taurus with the seven
1	up to the tropick crab thence down amain
1	as deep as capricorn to bring in change
1	of seasons to each clime else had the spring
1	perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers 
1	equal in days and nights except to those
1	beyond the polar circles to them day
1	had unbenighted shone while the low sun 
1	to recompense his distance in their sight
1	had rounded still the horizon and not known
1	or east or west which had forbid the snow
1	from cold estotiland and south as far
1	beneath magellan at that tasted fruit
1	the sun as from thyestean banquet turned
1	his course intended else how had the world
1	inhabited though sinless more than now 
1	avoided pinching cold and scorching heat 
1	these changes in the heavens though slow produced
1	like change on sea and land sideral blast 
1	vapour and mist and exhalation hot 
1	corrupt and pestilent now from the north
1	of norumbega and the samoed shore 
1	bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice 
1	and snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw 
1	boreas and caecias and argestes loud 
1	and thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn 
1	with adverse blast upturns them from the south
1	notus and afer black with thunderous clouds
1	from serraliona thwart of these as fierce 
1	forth rush the levant and the ponent winds 
1	eurus and zephyr with their lateral noise 
1	sirocco and libecchio thus began
1	outrage from lifeless things but discord first 
1	daughter of sin among the irrational
1	death introduced through fierce antipathy 
1	beast now with beast gan war and fowl with fowl 
1	and fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving 
1	devoured each other nor stood much in awe
1	of man but fled him or with countenance grim 
1	glared on him passing these were from without
1	the growing miseries which adam saw
1	already in part though hid in gloomiest shade 
1	to sorrow abandoned but worse felt within 
1	and in a troubled sea of passion tost 
1	thus to disburden sought with sad complaint 
1	o miserable of happy is this the end
1	of this new glorious world and me so late
1	the glory of that glory who now become
1	accursed of blessed hide me from the face
1	of god whom to behold was then my highth
1	of happiness yet well if here would end
1	the misery i deserved it and would bear
1	my own deservings but this will not serve 
1	all that i eat or drink or shall beget 
1	is propagated curse o voice once heard
1	delightfully encrease and multiply 
1	now death to hear for what can i encrease 
1	or multiply but curses on my head 
1	who of all ages to succeed but feeling
1	the evil on him brought by me will curse
1	my head ill fare our ancestor impure 
1	for this we may thank adam but his thanks
1	shall be the execration so besides
1	mine own that bide upon me all from me
1	shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound 
1	on me as on their natural center light
1	heavy though in their place o fleeting joys
1	of paradise dear bought with lasting woes 
1	did i request thee maker from my clay
1	to mould me man did i solicit thee
1	from darkness to promote me or here place
1	in this delicious garden as my will
1	concurred not to my being it were but right
1	and equal to reduce me to my dust 
1	desirous to resign and render back
1	all i received unable to perform
1	thy terms too hard by which i was to hold
1	the good i sought not to the loss of that 
1	sufficient penalty why hast thou added
1	the sense of endless woes inexplicable
1	thy justice seems yet to say truth too late
1	i thus contest then should have been refused
1	those terms whatever when they were proposed 
1	thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good 
1	then cavil the conditions and though god
1	made thee without thy leave what if thy son
1	prove disobedient and reproved retort 
1	 wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not 
1	wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
1	that proud excuse yet him not thy election 
1	but natural necessity begot 
1	god made thee of choice his own and of his own
1	to serve him thy reward was of his grace 
1	thy punishment then justly is at his will 
1	be it so for i submit his doom is fair 
1	that dust i am and shall to dust return 
1	o welcome hour whenever why delays
1	his hand to execute what his decree
1	fixed on this day why do i overlive 
1	why am i mocked with death and lengthened out
1	to deathless pain how gladly would i meet
1	mortality my sentence and be earth
1	insensible how glad would lay me down
1	as in my mother s lap there i should rest 
1	and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
1	would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
1	to me and to my offspring would torment me
1	with cruel expectation yet one doubt
1	pursues me still lest all i cannot die 
1	lest that pure breath of life the spirit of man
1	which god inspired cannot together perish
1	with this corporeal clod then in the grave 
1	or in some other dismal place who knows
1	but i shall die a living death o thought
1	horrid if true yet why it was but breath
1	of life that sinned what dies but what had life
1	and sin the body properly had neither 
1	all of me then shall die let this appease
1	the doubt since human reach no further knows 
1	for though the lord of all be infinite 
1	is his wrath also be it man is not so 
1	but mortal doomed how can he exercise
1	wrath without end on man whom death must end 
1	can he make deathless death that were to make
1	strange contradiction which to god himself
1	impossible is held as argument
1	of weakness not of power will he draw out 
1	for anger s sake finite to infinite 
1	in punished man to satisfy his rigour 
1	satisfied never that were to extend
1	his sentence beyond dust and nature s law 
1	by which all causes else according still
1	to the reception of their matter act 
1	not to the extent of their own sphere but say
1	that death be not one stroke as i supposed 
1	bereaving sense but endless misery
1	from this day onward which i feel begun
1	both in me and without me and so last
1	to perpetuity ay me that fear
1	comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
1	on my defenceless head both death and i
1	am found eternal and incorporate both 
1	nor i on my part single in me all
1	posterity stands cursed fair patrimony
1	that i must leave ye sons o were i able
1	to waste it all myself and leave ye none 
1	so disinherited how would you bless
1	me now your curse ah why should all mankind 
1	for one man s fault thus guiltless be condemned 
1	it guiltless but from me what can proceed 
1	but all corrupt both mind and will depraved
1	not to do only but to will the same
1	with me how can they then acquitted stand
1	in sight of god him after all disputes 
1	forced i absolve all my evasions vain 
1	and reasonings though through mazes lead me still
1	but to my own conviction first and last
1	on me me only as the source and spring
1	of all corruption all the blame lights due 
1	so might the wrath fond wish couldst thou support
1	that burden heavier than the earth to bear 
1	than all the world much heavier though divided
1	with that bad woman thus what thou desirest 
1	and what thou fearest alike destroys all hope
1	of refuge and concludes thee miserable
1	beyond all past example and future 
1	to satan only like both crime and doom 
1	o conscience into what abyss of fears
1	and horrours hast thou driven me out of which
1	i find no way from deep to deeper plunged 
1	thus adam to himself lamented loud 
1	through the still night not now as ere man fell 
1	wholesome and cool and mild but with black air
1	accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom 
1	which to his evil conscience represented
1	all things with double terrour on the ground
1	outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft
1	cursed his creation death as oft accused
1	the day of his offence why comes not death 
1	said he with one thrice acceptable stroke
1	to end me shall truth fail to keep her word 
1	justice divine not hasten to be just 
1	but death comes not at call justice divine
1	mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries 
1	o woods o fountains hillocks dales and bowers 
1	with other echo late i taught your shades
1	to answer and resound far other song 
1	whom thus afflicted when sad eve beheld 
1	desolate where she sat approaching nigh 
1	soft words to his fierce passion she assayed 
1	but her with stern regard he thus repelled 
1	out of my sight thou serpent that name best
1	befits thee with him leagued thyself as false
1	and hateful nothing wants but that thy shape 
1	like his and colour serpentine may show
1	thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
1	henceforth lest that too heavenly form pretended
1	to hellish falshood snare them but for thee
1	i had persisted happy had not thy pride
1	and wandering vanity when least was safe 
1	rejected my forewarning and disdained
1	not to be trusted longing to be seen 
1	though by the devil himself him overweening
1	to over reach but with the serpent meeting 
1	fooled and beguiled by him thou i by thee
1	to trust thee from my side imagined wise 
1	constant mature proof against all assaults 
1	and understood not all was but a show 
1	rather than solid virtue all but a rib
1	crooked by nature bent as now appears 
1	more to the part sinister from me drawn 
1	well if thrown out as supernumerary
1	to my just number found o why did god 
1	creator wise that peopled highest heaven
1	with spirits masculine create at last
1	this novelty on earth this fair defect
1	of nature and not fill the world at once
1	with men as angels without feminine 
1	or find some other way to generate
1	mankind this mischief had not been befallen 
1	and more that shall befall innumerable
1	disturbances on earth through female snares 
1	and strait conjunction with this sex for either
1	he never shall find out fit mate but such
1	as some misfortune brings him or mistake 
1	or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
1	through her perverseness but shall see her gained
1	by a far worse or if she love withheld
1	by parents or his happiest choice too late
1	shall meet already linked and wedlock bound
1	to a fell adversary his hate or shame 
1	which infinite calamity shall cause
1	to human life and houshold peace confound 
1	he added not and from her turned but eve 
1	not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing
1	and tresses all disordered at his feet
1	fell humble and embracing them besought
1	his peace and thus proceeded in her plaint 
1	forsake me not thus adam witness heaven
1	what love sincere and reverence in my heart
1	i bear thee and unweeting have offended 
1	unhappily deceived thy suppliant
1	i beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not 
1	whereon i live thy gentle looks thy aid 
1	thy counsel in this uttermost distress 
1	my only strength and stay forlorn of thee 
1	whither shall i betake me where subsist 
1	while yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps 
1	between us two let there be peace both joining 
1	as joined in injuries one enmity
1	against a foe by doom express assigned us 
1	that cruel serpent on me exercise not
1	thy hatred for this misery befallen 
1	on me already lost me than thyself
1	more miserable both have sinned but thou
1	against god only i against god and thee 
1	and to the place of judgement will return 
1	there with my cries importune heaven that all
1	the sentence from thy head removed may light
1	on me sole cause to thee of all this woe 
1	me me only just object of his ire 
1	she ended weeping and her lowly plight 
1	immoveable till peace obtained from fault
1	acknowledged and deplored in adam wrought
1	commiseration soon his heart relented
1	towards her his life so late and sole delight 
1	now at his feet submissive in distress 
1	creature so fair his reconcilement seeking 
1	his counsel whom she had displeased his aid 
1	as one disarmed his anger all he lost 
1	and thus with peaceful words upraised her soon 
1	unwary and too desirous as before 
1	so now of what thou knowest not who desirest
1	the punishment all on thyself alas 
1	bear thine own first ill able to sustain
1	his full wrath whose thou feelest as yet least part 
1	and my displeasure bearest so ill if prayers
1	could alter high decrees i to that place
1	would speed before thee and be louder heard 
1	that on my head all might be visited 
1	thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven 
1	to me committed and by me exposed 
1	but rise let us no more contend nor blame
1	each other blamed enough elsewhere but strive
1	in offices of love how we may lighten
1	each other s burden in our share of woe 
1	since this day s death denounced if aught i see 
1	will prove no sudden but a slow paced evil 
1	a long day s dying to augment our pain 
1	and to our seed o hapless seed derived 
1	to whom thus eve recovering heart replied 
1	adam by sad experiment i know
1	how little weight my words with thee can find 
1	found so erroneous thence by just event
1	found so unfortunate nevertheless 
1	restored by thee vile as i am to place
1	of new acceptance hopeful to regain
1	thy love the sole contentment of my heart
1	living or dying from thee i will not hide
1	what thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen 
1	tending to some relief of our extremes 
1	or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable 
1	as in our evils and of easier choice 
1	if care of our descent perplex us most 
1	which must be born to certain woe devoured
1	by death at last and miserable it is
1	to be to others cause of misery 
1	our own begotten and of our loins to bring
1	into this cursed world a woeful race 
1	that after wretched life must be at last
1	food for so foul a monster in thy power
1	it lies yet ere conception to prevent
1	the race unblest to being yet unbegot 
1	childless thou art childless remain so death
1	shall be deceived his glut and with us two
1	be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw 
1	but if thou judge it hard and difficult 
1	conversing looking loving to abstain
1	from love s due rights nuptial embraces sweet 
1	and with desire to languish without hope 
1	before the present object languishing
1	with like desire which would be misery
1	and torment less than none of what we dread 
1	then both ourselves and seed at once to free
1	from what we fear for both let us make short 
1	let us seek death or he not found supply
1	with our own hands his office on ourselves 
1	why stand we longer shivering under fears 
1	that show no end but death and have the power 
1	of many ways to die the shortest choosing 
1	destruction with destruction to destroy 
1	she ended here or vehement despair
1	broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts
1	had entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale 
1	but adam with such counsel nothing swayed 
1	to better hopes his more attentive mind
1	labouring had raised and thus to eve replied 
1	eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
1	to argue in thee something more sublime
1	and excellent than what thy mind contemns 
1	but self destruction therefore sought refutes
1	that excellence thought in thee and implies 
1	not thy contempt but anguish and regret
1	for loss of life and pleasure overloved 
1	or if thou covet death as utmost end
1	of misery so thinking to evade
1	the penalty pronounced doubt not but god
1	hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so
1	to be forestalled much more i fear lest death 
1	so snatched will not exempt us from the pain
1	we are by doom to pay rather such acts
1	of contumacy will provoke the highest
1	to make death in us live then let us seek
1	some safer resolution which methinks
1	i have in view calling to mind with heed
1	part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise
1	the serpent s head piteous amends unless
1	be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe 
1	satan who in the serpent hath contrived
1	against us this deceit to crush his head
1	would be revenge indeed which will be lost
1	by death brought on ourselves or childless days
1	resolved as thou proposest so our foe
1	shal scape his punishment ordained and we
1	instead shall double ours upon our heads 
1	no more be mentioned then of violence
1	against ourselves and wilful barrenness 
1	that cuts us off from hope and savours only
1	rancour and pride impatience and despite 
1	reluctance against god and his just yoke
1	laid on our necks remember with what mild
1	and gracious temper he both heard and judged 
1	without wrath or reviling we expected
1	immediate dissolution which we thought
1	was meant by death that day when lo to thee
1	pains only in child bearing were foretold 
1	and bringing forth soon recompensed with joy 
1	fruit of thy womb on me the curse aslope
1	glanced on the ground with labour i must earn
1	my bread what harm idleness had been worse 
1	my labour will sustain me and lest cold
1	or heat should injure us his timely care
1	hath unbesought provided and his hands
1	clothed us unworthy pitying while he judged 
1	how much more if we pray him will his ear
1	be open and his heart to pity incline 
1	and teach us further by what means to shun
1	the inclement seasons rain ice hail and snow 
1	which now the sky with various face begins
1	to show us in this mountain while the winds
1	blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks
1	of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek
1	some better shroud some better warmth to cherish
1	our limbs benummed ere this diurnal star
1	leave cold the night how we his gathered beams
1	reflected may with matter sere foment 
1	or by collision of two bodies grind
1	the air attrite to fire as late the clouds
1	justling or pushed with winds rude in their shock 
1	tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driven down
1	kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine 
1	and sends a comfortable heat from far 
1	which might supply the sun such fire to use 
1	and what may else be remedy or cure
1	to evils which our own misdeeds have wrought 
1	he will instruct us praying and of grace
1	beseeching him so as we need not fear
1	to pass commodiously this life sustained
1	by him with many comforts till we end
1	in dust our final rest and native home 
1	what better can we do than to the place
1	repairing where he judged us prostrate fall
1	before him reverent and there confess
1	humbly our faults and pardon beg with tears
1	watering the ground and with our sighs the air
1	frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
1	of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek 
1	undoubtedly he will relent and turn
1	from his displeasure in whose look serene 
1	when angry most he seemed and most severe 
1	what else but favour grace and mercy shone 
1	so spake our father penitent nor eve
1	felt less remorse they forthwith to the place
1	repairing where he judged them prostrate fell
1	before him reverent and both confessed
1	humbly their faults and pardon begged with tears
1	watering the ground and with their sighs the air
1	frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
1	of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek 
1	thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
1	praying for from the mercy seat above
1	prevenient grace descending had removed
1	the stony from their hearts and made new flesh
1	regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed
1	unutterable which the spirit of prayer
1	inspired and winged for heaven with speedier flight
1	than loudest oratory yet their port
1	not of mean suitors nor important less
1	seemed their petition than when the ancient pair
1	in fables old less ancient yet than these 
1	deucalion and chaste pyrrha to restore
1	the race of mankind drowned before the shrine
1	of themis stood devout to heaven their prayers
1	flew up nor missed the way by envious winds
1	blown vagabond or frustrate in they passed
1	dimensionless through heavenly doors then clad
1	with incense where the golden altar fumed 
1	by their great intercessour came in sight
1	before the father s throne them the glad son
1	presenting thus to intercede began 
1	see father what first fruits on earth are sprung
1	from thy implanted grace in man these sighs
1	and prayers which in this golden censer mixed
1	with incense i thy priest before thee bring 
1	fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed
1	sown with contrition in his heart than those
1	which his own hand manuring all the trees
1	of paradise could have produced ere fallen
1	from innocence now therefore bend thine ear
1	to supplication hear his sighs though mute 
1	unskilful with what words to pray let me
1	interpret for him me his advocate
1	and propitiation all his works on me 
1	good or not good ingraft my merit those
1	shall perfect and for these my death shall pay 
1	accept me and in me from these receive
1	the smell of peace toward mankind let him live
1	before thee reconciled at least his days
1	numbered though sad till death his doom which i
1	to mitigate thus plead not to reverse 
1	to better life shall yield him where with me
1	all my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss 
1	made one with me as i with thee am one 
1	to whom the father without cloud serene 
1	all thy request for man accepted son 
1	obtain all thy request was my decree 
1	but longer in that paradise to dwell 
1	the law i gave to nature him forbids 
1	those pure immortal elements that know 
1	no gross no unharmonious mixture foul 
1	eject him tainted now and purge him off 
1	as a distemper gross to air as gross 
1	and mortal food as may dispose him best
1	for dissolution wrought by sin that first
1	distempered all things and of incorrupt
1	corrupted i at first with two fair gifts
1	created him endowed with happiness 
1	and immortality that fondly lost 
1	this other served but to eternize woe 
1	till i provided death so death becomes
1	his final remedy and after life 
1	tried in sharp tribulation and refined
1	by faith and faithful works to second life 
1	waked in the renovation of the just 
1	resigns him up with heaven and earth renewed 
1	but let us call to synod all the blest 
1	through heaven s wide bounds from them i will not hide
1	my judgements how with mankind i proceed 
1	as how with peccant angels late they saw 
1	and in their state though firm stood more confirmed 
1	he ended and the son gave signal high
1	to the bright minister that watched he blew
1	his trumpet heard in oreb since perhaps
1	when god descended and perhaps once more
1	to sound at general doom the angelick blast
1	filled all the regions from their blisful bowers
1	of amarantine shade fountain or spring 
1	by the waters of life where er they sat
1	in fellowships of joy the sons of light
1	hasted resorting to the summons high 
1	and took their seats till from his throne supreme
1	the almighty thus pronounced his sovran will 
1	o sons like one of us man is become
1	to know both good and evil since his taste
1	of that defended fruit but let him boast
1	his knowledge of good lost and evil got 
1	happier had it sufficed him to have known
1	good by itself and evil not at all 
1	he sorrows now repents and prays contrite 
1	my motions in him longer than they move 
1	his heart i know how variable and vain 
1	self left lest therefore his now bolder hand
1	reach also of the tree of life and eat 
1	and live for ever dream at least to live
1	for ever to remove him i decree 
1	and send him from the garden forth to till
1	the ground whence he was taken fitter soil 
1	michael this my behest have thou in charge 
1	take to thee from among the cherubim
1	thy choice of flaming warriours lest the fiend 
1	or in behalf of man or to invade
1	vacant possession some new trouble raise 
1	haste thee and from the paradise of god
1	without remorse drive out the sinful pair 
1	from hallowed ground the unholy and denounce
1	to them and to their progeny from thence
1	perpetual banishment yet lest they faint
1	at the sad sentence rigorously urged 
1	 for i behold them softened and with tears
1	bewailing their excess all terrour hide 
1	if patiently thy bidding they obey 
1	dismiss them not disconsolate reveal
1	to adam what shall come in future days 
1	as i shall thee enlighten intermix
1	my covenant in the woman s seed renewed 
1	so send them forth though sorrowing yet in peace 
1	and on the east side of the garden place 
1	where entrance up from eden easiest climbs 
1	cherubick watch and of a sword the flame
1	wide waving all approach far off to fright 
1	and guard all passage to the tree of life 
1	lest paradise a receptacle prove
1	to spirits foul and all my trees their prey 
1	with whose stolen fruit man once more to delude 
1	he ceased and the arch angelick power prepared
1	for swift descent with him the cohort bright
1	of watchful cherubim four faces each
1	had like a double janus all their shape
1	spangled with eyes more numerous than those
1	of argus and more wakeful than to drouse 
1	charmed with arcadian pipe the pastoral reed
1	of hermes or his opiate rod mean while 
1	to re salute the world with sacred light 
1	leucothea waked and with fresh dews imbalmed
1	the earth when adam and first matron eve
1	had ended now their orisons and found
1	strength added from above new hope to spring
1	out of despair joy but with fear yet linked 
1	which thus to eve his welcome words renewed 
1	eve easily my faith admit that all
1	the good which we enjoy from heaven descends 
1	but that from us aught should ascend to heaven
1	so prevalent as to concern the mind
1	of god high blest or to incline his will 
1	hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer
1	or one short sigh of human breath upborne
1	even to the seat of god for since i sought
1	by prayer the offended deity to appease 
1	kneeled and before him humbled all my heart 
1	methought i saw him placable and mild 
1	bending his ear persuasion in me grew
1	that i was heard with favour peace returned
1	home to my breast and to my memory
1	his promise that thy seed shall bruise our foe 
1	which then not minded in dismay yet now
1	assures me that the bitterness of death
1	is past and we shall live whence hail to thee 
1	eve rightly called mother of all mankind 
1	mother of all things living since by thee
1	man is to live and all things live for man 
1	to whom thus eve with sad demeanour meek 
1	ill worthy i such title should belong
1	to me transgressour who for thee ordained
1	a help became thy snare to me reproach
1	rather belongs distrust and all dispraise 
1	but infinite in pardon was my judge 
1	that i who first brought death on all am graced
1	the source of life next favourable thou 
1	who highly thus to entitle me vouchsaf st 
1	far other name deserving but the field
1	to labour calls us now with sweat imposed 
1	though after sleepless night for see the morn 
1	all unconcerned with our unrest begins
1	her rosy progress smiling let us forth 
1	i never from thy side henceforth to stray 
1	where er our day s work lies though now enjoined
1	laborious till day droop while here we dwell 
1	what can be toilsome in these pleasant walks 
1	here let us live though in fallen state content 
1	so spake so wished much humbled eve but fate
1	subscribed not nature first gave signs impressed
1	on bird beast air air suddenly eclipsed 
1	after short blush of morn nigh in her sight
1	the bird of jove stooped from his aery tour 
1	two birds of gayest plume before him drove 
1	down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods 
1	first hunter then pursued a gentle brace 
1	goodliest of all the forest hart and hind 
1	direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight 
1	adam observed and with his eye the chase
1	pursuing not unmoved to eve thus spake 
1	o eve some further change awaits us nigh 
1	which heaven by these mute signs in nature shows
1	forerunners of his purpose or to warn
1	us haply too secure of our discharge
1	from penalty because from death released
1	some days how long and what till then our life 
1	who knows or more than this that we are dust 
1	and thither must return and be no more 
1	why else this double object in our sight
1	of flight pursued in the air and o er the ground 
1	one way the self same hour why in the east
1	darkness ere day s mid course and morning light
1	more orient in yon western cloud that draws
1	o er the blue firmament a radiant white 
1	and slow descends with something heavenly fraught 
1	he erred not for by this the heavenly bands
1	down from a sky of jasper lighted now
1	in paradise and on a hill made halt 
1	a glorious apparition had not doubt
1	and carnal fear that day dimmed adam s eye 
1	not that more glorious when the angels met
1	jacob in mahanaim where he saw
1	the field pavilioned with his guardians bright 
1	nor that which on the flaming mount appeared
1	in dothan covered with a camp of fire 
1	against the syrian king who to surprise
1	one man assassin like had levied war 
1	war unproclaimed the princely hierarch
1	in their bright stand there left his powers to seise
1	possession of the garden he alone 
1	to find where adam sheltered took his way 
1	not unperceived of adam who to eve 
1	while the great visitant approached thus spake 
1	eve now expect great tidings which perhaps
1	of us will soon determine or impose
1	new laws to be observed for i descry 
1	from yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill 
1	one of the heavenly host and by his gait 
1	none of the meanest some great potentate
1	or of the thrones above such majesty
1	invests him coming yet not terrible 
1	that i should fear nor sociably mild 
1	as raphael that i should much confide 
1	but solemn and sublime whom not to offend 
1	with reverence i must meet and thou retire 
1	he ended and the arch angel soon drew nigh 
1	not in his shape celestial but as man
1	clad to meet man over his lucid arms
1	a military vest of purple flowed 
1	livelier than meliboean or the grain
1	of sarra worn by kings and heroes old
1	in time of truce iris had dipt the woof 
1	his starry helm unbuckled showed him prime
1	in manhood where youth ended by his side 
1	as in a glistering zodiack hung the sword 
1	satan s dire dread and in his hand the spear 
1	adam bowed low he kingly from his state
1	inclined not but his coming thus declared 
1	adam heaven s high behest no preface needs 
1	sufficient that thy prayers are heard and death 
1	then due by sentence when thou didst transgress 
1	defeated of his seisure many days
1	given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent 
1	and one bad act with many deeds well done
1	mayest cover well may then thy lord appeased 
1	redeem thee quite from death s rapacious claim 
1	but longer in this paradise to dwell
1	permits not to remove thee i am come 
1	and send thee from the garden forth to till
1	the ground whence thou wast taken fitter soil 
1	he added not for adam at the news
1	heart struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood 
1	that all his senses bound eve who unseen
1	yet all had heard with audible lament
1	discovered soon the place of her retire 
1	o unexpected stroke worse than of death 
1	must i thus leave thee paradise thus leave
1	thee native soil these happy walks and shades 
1	fit haunt of gods where i had hope to spend 
1	quiet though sad the respite of that day
1	that must be mortal to us both o flowers 
1	that never will in other climate grow 
1	my early visitation and my last
1	at even which i bred up with tender hand
1	from the first opening bud and gave ye names 
1	who now shall rear ye to the sun or rank
1	your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount 
1	thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned
1	with what to sight or smell was sweet from thee
1	how shall i part and whither wander down
1	into a lower world to this obscure
1	and wild how shall we breathe in other air
1	less pure accustomed to immortal fruits 
1	whom thus the angel interrupted mild 
1	lament not eve but patiently resign
1	what justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart 
1	thus over fond on that which is not thine 
1	thy going is not lonely with thee goes
1	thy husband whom to follow thou art bound 
1	where he abides think there thy native soil 
1	adam by this from the cold sudden damp
1	recovering and his scattered spirits returned 
1	to michael thus his humble words addressed 
1	celestial whether among the thrones or named
1	of them the highest for such of shape may seem
1	prince above princes gently hast thou told
1	thy message which might else in telling wound 
1	and in performing end us what besides
1	of sorrow and dejection and despair 
1	our frailty can sustain thy tidings bring 
1	departure from this happy place our sweet
1	recess and only consolation left
1	familiar to our eyes all places else
1	inhospitable appear and desolate 
1	nor knowing us nor known and if by prayer
1	incessant i could hope to change the will
1	of him who all things can i would not cease
1	to weary him with my assiduous cries 
1	but prayer against his absolute decree
1	no more avails than breath against the wind 
1	blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth 
1	therefore to his great bidding i submit 
1	this most afflicts me that departing hence 
1	as from his face i shall be hid deprived
1	his blessed countenance here i could frequent
1	with worship place by place where he vouchsafed
1	presence divine and to my sons relate 
1	on this mount he appeared under this tree
1	stood visible among these pines his voice
1	i heard here with him at this fountain talked 
1	so many grateful altars i would rear
1	of grassy turf and pile up every stone
1	of lustre from the brook in memory 
1	or monument to ages and theron
1	offer sweet smelling gums and fruits and flowers 
1	in yonder nether world where shall i seek
1	his bright appearances or foot step trace 
1	for though i fled him angry yet recalled
1	to life prolonged and promised race i now
1	gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
1	of glory and far off his steps adore 
1	to whom thus michael with regard benign 
1	adam thou knowest heaven his and all the earth 
1	not this rock only his omnipresence fills
1	land sea and air and every kind that lives 
1	fomented by his virtual power and warmed 
1	all the earth he gave thee to possess and rule 
1	no despicable gift surmise not then
1	his presence to these narrow bounds confined
1	of paradise or eden this had been
1	perhaps thy capital seat from whence had spread
1	all generations and had hither come
1	from all the ends of the earth to celebrate
1	and reverence thee their great progenitor 
1	but this pre eminence thou hast lost brought down
1	to dwell on even ground now with thy sons 
1	yet doubt not but in valley and in plain 
1	god is as here and will be found alike
1	present and of his presence many a sign
1	still following thee still compassing thee round
1	with goodness and paternal love his face
1	express and of his steps the track divine 
1	which that thou mayest believe and be confirmed
1	ere thou from hence depart know i am sent
1	to show thee what shall come in future days
1	to thee and to thy offspring good with bad
1	expect to hear supernal grace contending
1	with sinfulness of men thereby to learn
1	true patience and to temper joy with fear
1	and pious sorrow equally inured
1	by moderation either state to bear 
1	prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead
1	safest thy life and best prepared endure
1	thy mortal passage when it comes ascend
1	this hill let eve for i have drenched her eyes 
1	here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest 
1	as once thou sleptst while she to life was formed 
1	to whom thus adam gratefully replied 
1	ascend i follow thee safe guide the path
1	thou leadest me and to the hand of heaven submit 
1	however chastening to the evil turn
1	my obvious breast arming to overcome
1	by suffering and earn rest from labour won 
1	if so i may attain so both ascend
1	in the visions of god it was a hill 
1	of paradise the highest from whose top
1	the hemisphere of earth in clearest ken 
1	stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay 
1	not higher that hill nor wider looking round 
1	whereon for different cause the tempter set
1	our second adam in the wilderness 
1	to show him all earth s kingdoms and their glory 
1	his eye might there command wherever stood
1	city of old or modern fame the seat
1	of mightiest empire from the destined walls
1	of cambalu seat of cathaian can 
1	and samarchand by oxus temir s throne 
1	to paquin of sinaean kings and thence
1	to agra and lahor of great mogul 
1	down to the golden chersonese or where
1	the persian in ecbatan sat or since
1	in hispahan or where the russian ksar
1	turchestan born nor could his eye not ken
1	the empire of negus to his utmost port
1	ercoco and the less maritim kings
1	and sofala thought ophir to the realm
1	of congo and angola farthest south 
1	or thence from niger flood to atlas mount
1	the kingdoms of almansor fez and sus 
1	on europe thence and where rome was to sway
1	the world in spirit perhaps he also saw
1	rich mexico the seat of montezume 
1	and cusco in peru the richer seat
1	of atabalipa and yet unspoiled
1	guiana whose great city geryon s sons
1	call el dorado but to nobler sights
1	michael from adam s eyes the film removed 
1	which that false fruit that promised clearer sight
1	had bred then purged with euphrasy and rue
1	the visual nerve for he had much to see 
1	and from the well of life three drops instilled 
1	so deep the power of these ingredients pierced 
1	even to the inmost seat of mental sight 
1	that adam now enforced to close his eyes 
1	sunk down and all his spirits became entranced 
1	but him the gentle angel by the hand
1	soon raised and his attention thus recalled 
1	adam now ope thine eyes and first behold
1	the effects which thy original crime hath wrought
1	in some to spring from thee who never touched
1	the excepted tree nor with the snake conspired 
1	nor sinned thy sin yet from that sin derive
1	corruption to bring forth more violent deeds 
1	his eyes he opened and beheld a field 
1	part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves
1	new reaped the other part sheep walks and folds 
1	i the midst an altar as the land mark stood 
1	rustick of grassy sord thither anon
1	a sweaty reaper from his tillage brought
1	first fruits the green ear and the yellow sheaf 
1	unculled as came to hand a shepherd next 
1	more meek came with the firstlings of his flock 
1	choicest and best then sacrificing laid
1	the inwards and their fat with incense strowed 
1	on the cleft wood and all due rights performed 
1	his offering soon propitious fire from heaven
1	consumed with nimble glance and grateful steam 
1	the other s not for his was not sincere 
1	whereat he inly raged and as they talked 
1	smote him into the midriff with a stone
1	that beat out life he fell and deadly pale 
1	groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused 
1	much at that sight was adam in his heart
1	dismayed and thus in haste to the angel cried 
1	o teacher some great mischief hath befallen
1	to that meek man who well had sacrificed 
1	is piety thus and pure devotion paid 
1	to whom michael thus he also moved replied 
1	these two are brethren adam and to come
1	out of thy loins the unjust the just hath slain 
1	for envy that his brother s offering found
1	from heaven acceptance but the bloody fact
1	will be avenged and the other s faith approved 
1	lose no reward though here thou see him die 
1	rolling in dust and gore to which our sire 
1	alas both for the deed and for the cause 
1	but have i now seen death is this the way
1	i must return to native dust o sight
1	of terrour foul and ugly to behold 
1	horrid to think how horrible to feel 
1	to whom thus michael death thou hast seen
1	in his first shape on man but many shapes
1	of death and many are the ways that lead
1	to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense
1	more terrible at the entrance than within 
1	some as thou sawest by violent stroke shall die 
1	by fire flood famine by intemperance more
1	in meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring
1	diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
1	before thee shall appear that thou mayest know
1	what misery the inabstinence of eve
1	shall bring on men immediately a place
1	before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark 
1	a lazar house it seemed wherein were laid
1	numbers of all diseased all maladies
1	of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms
1	of heart sick agony all feverous kinds 
1	convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs 
1	intestine stone and ulcer colick pangs 
1	demoniack phrenzy moaping melancholy 
1	and moon struck madness pining atrophy 
1	marasmus and wide wasting pestilence 
1	dropsies and asthmas and joint racking rheums 
1	dire was the tossing deep the groans despair
1	tended the sick busiest from couch to couch 
1	and over them triumphant death his dart
1	shook but delayed to strike though oft invoked
1	with vows as their chief good and final hope 
1	sight so deform what heart of rock could long
1	dry eyed behold adam could not but wept 
1	though not of woman born compassion quelled
1	his best of man and gave him up to tears
1	a space till firmer thoughts restrained excess 
1	and scarce recovering words his plaint renewed 
1	o miserable mankind to what fall
1	degraded to what wretched state reserved 
1	better end here unborn why is life given
1	to be thus wrested from us rather why
1	obtruded on us thus who if we knew
1	what we receive would either no accept
1	life offered or soon beg to lay it down 
1	glad to be so dismissed in peace can thus
1	the image of god in man created once
1	so goodly and erect though faulty since 
1	to such unsightly sufferings be debased
1	under inhuman pains why should not man 
1	retaining still divine similitude
1	in part from such deformities be free 
1	and for his maker s image sake exempt 
1	their maker s image answered michael then
1	forsook them when themselves they vilified
1	to serve ungoverned appetite and took
1	his image whom they served a brutish vice 
1	inductive mainly to the sin of eve 
1	therefore so abject is their punishment 
1	disfiguring not god s likeness but their own 
1	or if his likeness by themselves defaced 
1	while they pervert pure nature s healthful rules
1	to loathsome sickness worthily since they
1	god s image did not reverence in themselves 
1	i yield it just said adam and submit 
1	but is there yet no other way besides
1	these painful passages how we may come
1	to death and mix with our connatural dust 
1	there is said michael if thou well observe
1	the rule of not too much by temperance taught 
1	in what thou eatest and drinkest seeking from thence
1	due nourishment not gluttonous delight 
1	till many years over thy head return 
1	so mayest thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop
1	into thy mother s lap or be with ease
1	gathered nor harshly plucked for death mature 
1	this is old age but then thou must outlive
1	thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change
1	to withered weak and gray thy senses then 
1	obtuse all taste of pleasure must forego 
1	to what thou hast and for the air of youth 
1	hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reign
1	a melancholy damp of cold and dry
1	to weigh thy spirits down and last consume
1	the balm of life to whom our ancestor 
1	henceforth i fly not death nor would prolong
1	life much bent rather how i may be quit 
1	fairest and easiest of this cumbrous charge 
1	which i must keep till my appointed day
1	of rendering up and patiently attend
1	my dissolution michael replied 
1	nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livest
1	live well how long or short permit to heaven 
1	and now prepare thee for another sight 
1	he looked and saw a spacious plain whereon
1	were tents of various hue by some were herds
1	of cattle grazing others whence the sound
1	of instruments that made melodious chime 
1	was heard of harp and organ and who moved
1	their stops and chords was seen his volant touch 
1	instinct through all proportions low and high 
1	fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue 
1	in other part stood one who at the forge
1	labouring two massy clods of iron and brass
1	had melted whether found where casual fire
1	had wasted woods on mountain or in vale 
1	down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot
1	to some cave s mouth or whether washed by stream
1	from underground the liquid ore he drained
1	into fit moulds prepared from which he formed
1	first his own tools then what might else be wrought
1	fusil or graven in metal after these 
1	but on the hither side a different sort
1	from the high neighbouring hills which was their seat 
1	down to the plain descended by their guise
1	just men they seemed and all their study bent
1	to worship god aright and know his works
1	not hid nor those things last which might preserve
1	freedom and peace to men they on the plain
1	long had not walked when from the tents behold 
1	a bevy of fair women richly gay
1	in gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung
1	soft amorous ditties and in dance came on 
1	the men though grave eyed them and let their eyes
1	rove without rein till in the amorous net
1	fast caught they liked and each his liking chose 
1	and now of love they treat till the evening star 
1	love s harbinger appeared then all in heat
1	they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke
1	hymen then first to marriage rites invoked 
1	with feast and musick all the tents resound 
1	such happy interview and fair event
1	of love and youth not lost songs garlands flowers 
1	and charming symphonies attached the heart
1	of adam soon inclined to admit delight 
1	the bent of nature which he thus expressed 
1	true opener of mine eyes prime angel blest 
1	much better seems this vision and more hope
1	of peaceful days portends than those two past 
1	those were of hate and death or pain much worse 
1	here nature seems fulfilled in all her ends 
1	to whom thus michael judge not what is best
1	by pleasure though to nature seeming meet 
1	created as thou art to nobler end
1	holy and pure conformity divine 
1	those tents thou sawest so pleasant were the tents
1	of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race
1	who slew his brother studious they appear
1	of arts that polish life inventers rare 
1	unmindful of their maker though his spirit
1	taught them but they his gifts acknowledged none 
1	yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget 
1	for that fair female troop thou sawest that seemed
1	of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay 
1	yet empty of all good wherein consists
1	woman s domestick honour and chief praise 
1	bred only and completed to the taste
1	of lustful appetence to sing to dance 
1	to dress and troll the tongue and roll the eye 
1	to these that sober race of men whose lives
1	religious titled them the sons of god 
1	shall yield up all their virtue all their fame
1	ignobly to the trains and to the smiles
1	of these fair atheists and now swim in joy 
1	erelong to swim at large and laugh for which
1	the world erelong a world of tears must weep 
1	to whom thus adam of short joy bereft 
1	o pity and shame that they who to live well
1	entered so fair should turn aside to tread
1	paths indirect or in the mid way faint 
1	but still i see the tenour of man s woe
1	holds on the same from woman to begin 
1	from man s effeminate slackness it begins 
1	said the angel who should better hold his place
1	by wisdom and superiour gifts received 
1	but now prepare thee for another scene 
1	he looked and saw wide territory spread
1	before him towns and rural works between 
1	cities of men with lofty gates and towers 
1	concourse in arms fierce faces threatening war 
1	giants of mighty bone and bold emprise 
1	part wield their arms part curb the foaming steed 
1	single or in array of battle ranged
1	both horse and foot nor idly mustering stood 
1	one way a band select from forage drives
1	a herd of beeves fair oxen and fair kine 
1	from a fat meadow ground or fleecy flock 
1	ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain 
1	their booty scarce with life the shepherds fly 
1	but call in aid which makes a bloody fray 
1	with cruel tournament the squadrons join 
1	where cattle pastured late now scattered lies
1	with carcasses and arms the ensanguined field 
1	deserted others to a city strong
1	lay siege encamped by battery scale and mine 
1	assaulting others from the wall defend
1	with dart and javelin stones and sulphurous fire 
1	on each hand slaughter and gigantick deeds 
1	in other part the sceptered heralds call
1	to council in the city gates anon
1	gray headed men and grave with warriours mixed 
1	assemble and harangues are heard but soon 
1	in factious opposition till at last 
1	of middle age one rising eminent
1	in wise deport spake much of right and wrong 
1	of justice or religion truth and peace 
1	and judgement from above him old and young
1	exploded and had seized with violent hands 
1	had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
1	unseen amid the throng so violence
1	proceeded and oppression and sword law 
1	through all the plain and refuge none was found 
1	adam was all in tears and to his guide
1	lamenting turned full sad o what are these 
1	death s ministers not men who thus deal death
1	inhumanly to men and multiply
1	ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
1	his brother for of whom such massacre
1	make they but of their brethren men of men
1	but who was that just man whom had not heaven
1	rescued had in his righteousness been lost 
1	to whom thus michael these are the product
1	of those ill mated marriages thou sawest 
1	where good with bad were matched who of themselves
1	abhor to join and by imprudence mixed 
1	produce prodigious births of body or mind 
1	such were these giants men of high renown 
1	for in those days might only shall be admired 
1	and valour and heroick virtue called 
1	to overcome in battle and subdue
1	nations and bring home spoils with infinite
1	man slaughter shall be held the highest pitch
1	of human glory and for glory done
1	of triumph to be styled great conquerours
1	patrons of mankind gods and sons of gods 
1	destroyers rightlier called and plagues of men 
1	thus fame shall be achieved renown on earth 
1	and what most merits fame in silence hid 
1	but he the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst
1	the only righteous in a world preverse 
1	and therefore hated therefore so beset
1	with foes for daring single to be just 
1	and utter odious truth that god would come
1	to judge them with his saints him the most high
1	rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
1	did as thou sawest receive to walk with god
1	high in salvation and the climes of bliss 
1	exempt from death to show thee what reward
1	awaits the good the rest what punishment 
1	which now direct thine eyes and soon behold 
1	he looked and saw the face of things quite changed 
1	the brazen throat of war had ceased to roar 
1	all now was turned to jollity and game 
1	to luxury and riot feast and dance 
1	marrying or prostituting as befel 
1	rape or adultery where passing fair
1	allured them thence from cups to civil broils 
1	at length a reverend sire among them came 
1	and of their doings great dislike declared 
1	and testified against their ways he oft
1	frequented their assemblies whereso met 
1	triumphs or festivals and to them preached
1	conversion and repentance as to souls
1	in prison under judgements imminent 
1	but all in vain which when he saw he ceased
1	contending and removed his tents far off 
1	then from the mountain hewing timber tall 
1	began to build a vessel of huge bulk 
1	measured by cubit length and breadth and highth 
1	smeared round with pitch and in the side a door
1	contrived and of provisions laid in large 
1	for man and beast when lo a wonder strange 
1	of every beast and bird and insect small 
1	came sevens and pairs and entered in as taught
1	their order last the sire and his three sons 
1	with their four wives and god made fast the door 
1	mean while the south wind rose and with black wings
1	wide hovering all the clouds together drove
1	from under heaven the hills to their supply
1	vapour and exhalation dusk and moist 
1	sent up amain and now the thickened sky
1	like a dark ceiling stood down rushed the rain
1	impetuous and continued till the earth
1	no more was seen the floating vessel swum
1	uplifted and secure with beaked prow
1	rode tilting o er the waves all dwellings else
1	flood overwhelmed and them with all their pomp
1	deep under water rolled sea covered sea 
1	sea without shore and in their palaces 
1	where luxury late reigned sea monsters whelped
1	and stabled of mankind so numerous late 
1	all left in one small bottom swum imbarked 
1	how didst thou grieve then adam to behold
1	the end of all thy offspring end so sad 
1	depopulation thee another flood 
1	of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned 
1	and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reared
1	by the angel on thy feet thou stoodest at last 
1	though comfortless as when a father mourns
1	his children all in view destroyed at once 
1	and scarce to the angel utter dst thus thy plaint 
1	o visions ill foreseen better had i
1	lived ignorant of future so had borne
1	my part of evil only each day s lot
1	enough to bear those now that were dispensed
1	the burden of many ages on me light
1	at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth
1	abortive to torment me ere their being 
1	with thought that they must be let no man seek
1	henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
1	him or his children evil he may be sure 
1	which neither his foreknowing can prevent 
1	and he the future evil shall no less
1	in apprehension than in substance feel 
1	grievous to bear but that care now is past 
1	man is not whom to warn those few escaped
1	famine and anguish will at last consume 
1	wandering that watery desart i had hope 
1	when violence was ceased and war on earth 
1	all would have then gone well peace would have crowned
1	with length of happy days the race of man 
1	but i was far deceived for now i see
1	peace to corrupt no less than war to waste 
1	how comes it thus unfold celestial guide 
1	and whether here the race of man will end 
1	to whom thus michael those whom last thou sawest
1	in triumph and luxurious wealth are they
1	first seen in acts of prowess eminent
1	and great exploits but of true virtue void 
1	who having spilt much blood and done much wast
1	subduing nations and achieved thereby
1	fame in the world high titles and rich prey 
1	shall change their course to pleasure ease and sloth 
1	surfeit and lust till wantonness and pride
1	raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace 
1	the conquered also and enslaved by war 
1	shall with their freedom lost all virtue lose
1	and fear of god from whom their piety feigned
1	in sharp contest of battle found no aid
1	against invaders therefore cooled in zeal 
1	thenceforth shall practice how to live secure 
1	worldly or dissolute on what their lords
1	shall leave them to enjoy for the earth shall bear
1	more than enough that temperance may be tried 
1	so all shall turn degenerate all depraved 
1	justice and temperance truth and faith forgot 
1	one man except the only son of light
1	in a dark age against example good 
1	against allurement custom and a world
1	offended fearless of reproach and scorn 
1	or violence he of their wicked ways
1	shall them admonish and before them set
1	the paths of righteousness how much more safe
1	and full of peace denouncing wrath to come
1	on their impenitence and shall return
1	of them derided but of god observed
1	the one just man alive by his command
1	shall build a wonderous ark as thou beheldst 
1	to save himself and houshold from amidst
1	a world devote to universal wrack 
1	no sooner he with them of man and beast
1	select for life shall in the ark be lodged 
1	and sheltered round but all the cataracts
1	of heaven set open on the earth shall pour
1	rain day and night all fountains of the deep 
1	broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp
1	beyond all bounds till inundation rise
1	above the highest hills then shall this mount
1	of paradise by might of waves be moved
1	out of his place pushed by the horned flood 
1	with all his verdure spoiled and trees adrift 
1	down the great river to the opening gulf 
1	and there take root an island salt and bare 
1	the haunt of seals and orcs and sea mews clang 
1	to teach thee that god attributes to place
1	no sanctity if none be thither brought
1	by men who there frequent or therein dwell 
1	and now what further shall ensue behold 
1	he looked and saw the ark hull on the flood 
1	which now abated for the clouds were fled 
1	driven by a keen north wind that blowing dry 
1	wrinkled the face of deluge as decayed 
1	and the clear sun on his wide watery glass
1	gazed hot and of the fresh wave largely drew 
1	as after thirst which made their flowing shrink
1	from standing lake to tripping ebb that stole
1	with soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt
1	his sluces as the heaven his windows shut 
1	the ark no more now floats but seems on ground 
1	fast on the top of some high mountain fixed 
1	and now the tops of hills as rocks appear 
1	with clamour thence the rapid currents drive 
1	towards the retreating sea their furious tide 
1	forthwith from out the ark a raven flies 
1	and after him the surer messenger 
1	a dove sent forth once and again to spy
1	green tree or ground whereon his foot may light 
1	the second time returning in his bill
1	an olive leaf he brings pacifick sign 
1	anon dry ground appears and from his ark
1	the ancient sire descends with all his train 
1	then with uplifted hands and eyes devout 
1	grateful to heaven over his head beholds
1	a dewy cloud and in the cloud a bow
1	conspicuous with three lifted colours gay 
1	betokening peace from god and covenant new 
1	whereat the heart of adam erst so sad 
1	greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth 
1	o thou who future things canst represent
1	as present heavenly instructer i revive
1	at this last sight assured that man shall live 
1	with all the creatures and their seed preserve 
1	far less i now lament for one whole world
1	of wicked sons destroyed than i rejoice
1	for one man found so perfect and so just 
1	that god vouchsafes to raise another world
1	from him and all his anger to forget 
1	but say what mean those coloured streaks in heaven
1	distended as the brow of god appeased 
1	or serve they as a flowery verge to bind
1	the fluid skirts of that same watery cloud 
1	lest it again dissolve and shower the earth 
1	to whom the arch angel dextrously thou aimest 
1	so willingly doth god remit his ire 
1	though late repenting him of man depraved 
1	grieved at his heart when looking down he saw
1	the whole earth filled with violence and all flesh
1	corrupting each their way yet those removed 
1	such grace shall one just man find in his sight 
1	that he relents not to blot out mankind 
1	and makes a covenant never to destroy
1	the earth again by flood nor let the sea
1	surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world 
1	with man therein or beast but when he brings
1	over the earth a cloud will therein set
1	his triple coloured bow whereon to look 
1	and call to mind his covenant day and night 
1	seed time and harvest heat and hoary frost 
1	shall hold their course till fire purge all things new 
1	both heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell 
1	as one who in his journey bates at noon 
1	though bent on speed so here the arch angel paused
1	betwixt the world destroyed and world restored 
1	if adam aught perhaps might interpose 
1	then with transition sweet new speech resumes 
1	thus thou hast seen one world begin and end 
1	and man as from a second stock proceed 
1	much thou hast yet to see but i perceive
1	thy mortal sight to fail objects divine
1	must needs impair and weary human sense 
1	henceforth what is to come i will relate 
1	thou therefore give due audience and attend 
1	this second source of men while yet but few 
1	and while the dread of judgement past remains
1	fresh in their minds fearing the deity 
1	with some regard to what is just and right
1	shall lead their lives and multiply apace 
1	labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop 
1	corn wine and oil and from the herd or flock 
1	oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid 
1	with large wine offerings poured and sacred feast 
1	shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell
1	long time in peace by families and tribes 
1	under paternal rule till one shall rise
1	of proud ambitious heart who not content
1	with fair equality fraternal state 
1	will arrogate dominion undeserved
1	over his brethren and quite dispossess
1	concord and law of nature from the earth 
1	hunting and men not beasts shall be his game 
1	with war and hostile snare such as refuse
1	subjection to his empire tyrannous 
1	a mighty hunter thence he shall be styled
1	before the lord as in despite of heaven 
1	or from heaven claiming second sovranty 
1	and from rebellion shall derive his name 
1	though of rebellion others he accuse 
1	he with a crew whom like ambition joins
1	with him or under him to tyrannize 
1	marching from eden towards the west shall find
1	the plain wherein a black bituminous gurge
1	boils out from under ground the mouth of hell 
1	of brick and of that stuff they cast to build
1	a city and tower whose top may reach to heaven 
1	and get themselves a name lest far dispersed
1	in foreign lands their memory be lost 
1	regardless whether good or evil fame 
1	but god who oft descends to visit men
1	unseen and through their habitations walks
1	to mark their doings them beholding soon 
1	comes down to see their city ere the tower
1	obstruct heaven towers and in derision sets
1	upon their tongues a various spirit to rase
1	quite out their native language and instead 
1	to sow a jangling noise of words unknown 
1	forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud 
1	among the builders each to other calls
1	not understood till hoarse and all in rage 
1	as mocked they storm great laughter was in heaven 
1	and looking down to see the hubbub strange 
1	and hear the din thus was the building left
1	ridiculous and the work confusion named 
1	whereto thus adam fatherly displeased 
1	o execrable son so to aspire
1	above his brethren to himself assuming
1	authority usurped from god not given 
1	he gave us only over beast fish fowl 
1	dominion absolute that right we hold
1	by his donation but man over men
1	he made not lord such title to himself
1	reserving human left from human free 
1	but this usurper his encroachment proud
1	stays not on man to god his tower intends
1	siege and defiance wretched man what food
1	will he convey up thither to sustain
1	himself and his rash army where thin air
1	above the clouds will pine his entrails gross 
1	and famish him of breath if not of bread 
1	to whom thus michael justly thou abhorrest
1	that son who on the quiet state of men
1	such trouble brought affecting to subdue
1	rational liberty yet know withal 
1	since thy original lapse true liberty
1	is lost which always with right reason dwells
1	twinned and from her hath no dividual being 
1	reason in man obscured or not obeyed 
1	immediately inordinate desires 
1	and upstart passions catch the government
1	from reason and to servitude reduce
1	man till then free therefore since he permits
1	within himself unworthy powers to reign
1	over free reason god in judgement just 
1	subjects him from without to violent lords 
1	who oft as undeservedly enthrall
1	his outward freedom tyranny must be 
1	though to the tyrant thereby no excuse 
1	yet sometimes nations will decline so low
1	from virtue which is reason that no wrong 
1	but justice and some fatal curse annexed 
1	deprives them of their outward liberty 
1	their inward lost witness the irreverent son
1	of him who built the ark who for the shame
1	done to his father heard this heavy curse 
1	servant of servants on his vicious race 
1	thus will this latter as the former world 
1	still tend from bad to worse till god at last 
1	wearied with their iniquities withdraw
1	his presence from among them and avert
1	his holy eyes resolving from thenceforth
1	to leave them to their own polluted ways 
1	and one peculiar nation to select
1	from all the rest of whom to be invoked 
1	a nation from one faithful man to spring 
1	him on this side euphrates yet residing 
1	bred up in idol worship o that men
1	 canst thou believe should be so stupid grown 
1	while yet the patriarch lived who scaped the flood 
1	as to forsake the living god and fall
1	to worship their own work in wood and stone
1	for gods yet him god the most high vouchsafes
1	to call by vision from his father s house 
1	his kindred and false gods into a land
1	which he will show him and from him will raise
1	a mighty nation and upon him shower
1	his benediction so that in his seed
1	all nations shall be blest he straight obeys 
1	not knowing to what land yet firm believes 
1	i see him but thou canst not with what faith
1	he leaves his gods his friends and native soil 
1	ur of chaldaea passing now the ford
1	to haran after him a cumbrous train
1	of herds and flocks and numerous servitude 
1	not wandering poor but trusting all his wealth
1	with god who called him in a land unknown 
1	canaan he now attains i see his tents
1	pitched about sechem and the neighbouring plain
1	of moreh there by promise he receives
1	gift to his progeny of all that land 
1	from hameth northward to the desart south 
1	 things by their names i call though yet unnamed 
1	from hermon east to the great western sea 
1	mount hermon yonder sea each place behold
1	in prospect as i point them on the shore
1	mount carmel here the double founted stream 
1	jordan true limit eastward but his sons
1	shall dwell to senir that long ridge of hills 
1	this ponder that all nations of the earth
1	shall in his seed be blessed by that seed
1	is meant thy great deliverer who shall bruise
1	the serpent s head whereof to thee anon
1	plainlier shall be revealed this patriarch blest 
1	whom faithful abraham due time shall call 
1	a son and of his son a grand child leaves 
1	like him in faith in wisdom and renown 
1	the grandchild with twelve sons increased departs
1	from canaan to a land hereafter called
1	see where it flows disgorging at seven mouths
1	into the sea to sojourn in that land
1	he comes invited by a younger son
1	in time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds
1	raise him to be the second in that realm
1	of pharaoh there he dies and leaves his race
1	growing into a nation and now grown
1	suspected to a sequent king who seeks
1	to stop their overgrowth as inmate guests
1	too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves
1	inhospitably and kills their infant males 
1	till by two brethren these two brethren call
1	moses and aaron sent from god to claim
1	his people from enthralment they return 
1	with glory and spoil back to their promised land 
1	but first the lawless tyrant who denies
1	to know their god or message to regard 
1	must be compelled by signs and judgements dire 
1	to blood unshed the rivers must be turned 
1	frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill
1	with loathed intrusion and fill all the land 
1	his cattle must of rot and murren die 
1	botches and blains must all his flesh emboss 
1	and all his people thunder mixed with hail 
1	and wheel on the earth devouring where it rolls 
1	what it devours not herb or fruit or grain 
1	a darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
1	must eat and on the ground leave nothing green 
1	darkness must overshadow all his bounds 
1	palpable darkness and blot out three days 
1	last with one midnight stroke all the first born
1	the river dragon tamed at length submits
1	to let his sojourners depart and oft
1	humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice
1	more hardened after thaw till in his rage
1	pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea
1	swallows him with his host but them lets pass 
1	as on dry land between two crystal walls 
1	awed by the rod of moses so to stand
1	divided till his rescued gain their shore 
1	such wondrous power god to his saint will lend 
1	though present in his angel who shall go
1	before them in a cloud and pillar of fire 
1	by day a cloud by night a pillar of fire 
1	to guide them in their journey and remove
1	behind them while the obdurate king pursues 
1	all night he will pursue but his approach
1	darkness defends between till morning watch 
1	then through the fiery pillar and the cloud 
1	god looking forth will trouble all his host 
1	and craze their chariot wheels when by command
1	moses once more his potent rod extends
1	over the sea the sea his rod obeys 
1	on their embattled ranks the waves return 
1	and overwhelm their war the race elect
1	safe toward canaan from the shore advance
1	through the wild desart not the readiest way 
1	lest entering on the canaanite alarmed 
1	war terrify them inexpert and fear
1	inglorious life with servitude for life
1	to noble and ignoble is more sweet
1	untrained in arms where rashness leads not on 
1	this also shall they gain by their delay
1	in the wide wilderness there they shall found
1	their government and their great senate choose
1	through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordained 
1	god from the mount of sinai whose gray top
1	shall tremble he descending will himself
1	in thunder lightning and loud trumpets sound 
1	ordain them laws part such as appertain
1	to civil justice part religious rites
1	of sacrifice informing them by types
1	and shadows of that destined seed to bruise
1	the serpent by what means he shall achieve
1	mankind s deliverance but the voice of god
1	to mortal ear is dreadful they beseech
1	that moses might report to them his will 
1	and terrour cease he grants what they besought 
1	instructed that to god is no access
1	without mediator whose high office now
1	moses in figure bears to introduce
1	one greater of whose day he shall foretel 
1	and all the prophets in their age the times
1	of great messiah shall sing thus laws and rites
1	established such delight hath god in men
1	obedient to his will that he vouchsafes
1	among them to set up his tabernacle 
1	the holy one with mortal men to dwell 
1	by his prescript a sanctuary is framed
1	of cedar overlaid with gold therein
1	an ark and in the ark his testimony 
1	the records of his covenant over these
1	a mercy seat of gold between the wings
1	of two bright cherubim before him burn
1	seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
1	the heavenly fires over the tent a cloud
1	shall rest by day a fiery gleam by night 
1	save when they journey and at length they come 
1	conducted by his angel to the land
1	promised to abraham and his seed the rest
1	were long to tell how many battles fought
1	how many kings destroyed and kingdoms won 
1	or how the sun shall in mid heaven stand still
1	a day entire and night s due course adjourn 
1	man s voice commanding sun in gibeon stand 
1	and thou moon in the vale of aialon 
1	till israel overcome so call the third
1	from abraham son of isaac and from him
1	his whole descent who thus shall canaan win 
1	here adam interposed o sent from heaven 
1	enlightener of my darkness gracious things
1	thou hast revealed those chiefly which concern
1	just abraham and his seed now first i find
1	mine eyes true opening and my heart much eased 
1	erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become
1	of me and all mankind but now i see
1	his day in whom all nations shall be blest 
1	favour unmerited by me who sought
1	forbidden knowledge by forbidden means 
1	this yet i apprehend not why to those
1	among whom god will deign to dwell on earth
1	so many and so various laws are given 
1	so many laws argue so many sins
1	among them how can god with such reside 
1	to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin
1	will reign among them as of thee begot 
1	and therefore was law given them to evince
1	their natural pravity by stirring up
1	sin against law to fight that when they see
1	law can discover sin but not remove 
1	save by those shadowy expiations weak 
1	the blood of bulls and goats they may conclude
1	some blood more precious must be paid for man 
1	just for unjust that in such righteousness
1	to them by faith imputed they may find
1	justification towards god and peace
1	of conscience which the law by ceremonies
1	cannot appease nor man the mortal part
1	perform and not performing cannot live 
1	so law appears imperfect and but given
1	with purpose to resign them in full time 
1	up to a better covenant disciplined
1	from shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit 
1	from imposition of strict laws to free
1	acceptance of large grace from servile fear
1	to filial works of law to works of faith 
1	and therefore shall not moses though of god
1	highly beloved being but the minister
1	of law his people into canaan lead 
1	but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call 
1	his name and office bearing who shall quell
1	the adversary serpent and bring back
1	through the world s wilderness long wandered man
1	safe to eternal paradise of rest 
1	mean while they in their earthly canaan placed 
1	long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins
1	national interrupt their publick peace 
1	provoking god to raise them enemies 
1	from whom as oft he saves them penitent
1	by judges first then under kings of whom
1	the second both for piety renowned
1	and puissant deeds a promise shall receive
1	irrevocable that his regal throne
1	for ever shall endure the like shall sing
1	all prophecy that of the royal stock
1	of david so i name this king shall rise
1	a son the woman s seed to thee foretold 
1	foretold to abraham as in whom shall trust
1	all nations and to kings foretold of kings
1	the last for of his reign shall be no end 
1	but first a long succession must ensue 
1	and his next son for wealth and wisdom famed 
1	the clouded ark of god till then in tents
1	wandering shall in a glorious temple enshrine 
1	such follow him as shall be registered
1	part good part bad of bad the longer scroll 
1	whose foul idolatries and other faults
1	heaped to the popular sum will so incense
1	god as to leave them and expose their land 
1	their city his temple and his holy ark 
1	with all his sacred things a scorn and prey
1	to that proud city whose high walls thou sawest
1	left in confusion babylon thence called 
1	there in captivity he lets them dwell
1	the space of seventy years then brings them back 
1	remembering mercy and his covenant sworn
1	to david stablished as the days of heaven 
1	returned from babylon by leave of kings
1	their lords whom god disposed the house of god
1	they first re edify and for a while
1	in mean estate live moderate till grown
1	in wealth and multitude factious they grow 
1	but first among the priests dissention springs 
1	men who attend the altar and should most
1	endeavour peace their strife pollution brings
1	upon the temple itself at last they seise
1	the scepter and regard not david s sons 
1	then lose it to a stranger that the true
1	anointed king messiah might be born
1	barred of his right yet at his birth a star 
1	unseen before in heaven proclaims him come 
1	and guides the eastern sages who inquire
1	his place to offer incense myrrh and gold 
1	his place of birth a solemn angel tells
1	to simple shepherds keeping watch by night 
1	they gladly thither haste and by a quire
1	of squadroned angels hear his carol sung 
1	a virgin is his mother but his sire
1	the power of the most high he shall ascend
1	the throne hereditary and bound his reign
1	with earth s wide bounds his glory with the heavens 
1	he ceased discerning adam with such joy
1	surcharged as had like grief been dewed in tears 
1	without the vent of words which these he breathed 
1	o prophet of glad tidings finisher
1	of utmost hope now clear i understand
1	what oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain 
1	why our great expectation should be called
1	the seed of woman virgin mother hail 
1	high in the love of heaven yet from my loins
1	thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son
1	of god most high so god with man unites 
1	needs must the serpent now his capital bruise
1	expect with mortal pain say where and when
1	their fight what stroke shall bruise the victor s heel 
1	to whom thus michael dream not of their fight 
1	as of a duel or the local wounds
1	of head or heel not therefore joins the son
1	manhood to godhead with more strength to foil
1	thy enemy nor so is overcome
1	satan whose fall from heaven a deadlier bruise 
1	disabled not to give thee thy death s wound 
1	which he who comes thy saviour shall recure 
1	not by destroying satan but his works
1	in thee and in thy seed nor can this be 
1	but by fulfilling that which thou didst want 
1	obedience to the law of god imposed
1	on penalty of death and suffering death 
1	the penalty to thy transgression due 
1	and due to theirs which out of thine will grow 
1	so only can high justice rest appaid 
1	the law of god exact he shall fulfil
1	both by obedience and by love though love
1	alone fulfil the law thy punishment
1	he shall endure by coming in the flesh
1	to a reproachful life and cursed death 
1	proclaiming life to all who shall believe
1	in his redemption and that his obedience 
1	imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
1	to save them not their own though legal works 
1	for this he shall live hated be blasphemed 
1	seised on by force judged and to death condemned
1	a shameful and accursed nailed to the cross
1	by his own nation slain for bringing life 
1	but to the cross he nails thy enemies 
1	the law that is against thee and the sins
1	of all mankind with him there crucified 
1	never to hurt them more who rightly trust
1	in this his satisfaction so he dies 
1	but soon revives death over him no power
1	shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
1	return the stars of morn shall see him rise
1	out of his grave fresh as the dawning light 
1	thy ransom paid which man from death redeems 
1	his death for man as many as offered life
1	neglect not and the benefit embrace
1	by faith not void of works this god like act
1	annuls thy doom the death thou shouldest have died 
1	in sin for ever lost from life this act
1	shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength 
1	defeating sin and death his two main arms 
1	and fix far deeper in his head their stings
1	than temporal death shall bruise the victor s heel 
1	or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep 
1	a gentle wafting to immortal life 
1	nor after resurrection shall he stay
1	longer on earth than certain times to appear
1	to his disciples men who in his life
1	still followed him to them shall leave in charge
1	to teach all nations what of him they learned
1	and his salvation them who shall believe
1	baptizing in the profluent stream the sign
1	of washing them from guilt of sin to life
1	pure and in mind prepared if so befall 
1	for death like that which the redeemer died 
1	all nations they shall teach for from that day 
1	not only to the sons of abraham s loins
1	salvation shall be preached but to the sons
1	of abraham s faith wherever through the world 
1	so in his seed all nations shall be blest 
1	then to the heaven of heavens he shall ascend
1	with victory triumphing through the air
1	over his foes and thine there shall surprise
1	the serpent prince of air and drag in chains
1	through all his realm and there confounded leave 
1	then enter into glory and resume
1	his seat at god s right hand exalted high
1	above all names in heaven and thence shall come 
1	when this world s dissolution shall be ripe 
1	with glory and power to judge both quick and dead 
1	to judge the unfaithful dead but to reward
1	his faithful and receive them into bliss 
1	whether in heaven or earth for then the earth
1	shall all be paradise far happier place
1	than this of eden and far happier days 
1	so spake the arch angel michael then paused 
1	as at the world s great period and our sire 
1	replete with joy and wonder thus replied 
1	o goodness infinite goodness immense 
1	that all this good of evil shall produce 
1	and evil turn to good more wonderful
1	than that which by creation first brought forth
1	light out of darkness full of doubt i stand 
1	whether i should repent me now of sin
1	by me done and occasioned or rejoice
1	much more that much more good thereof shall spring 
1	to god more glory more good will to men
1	from god and over wrath grace shall abound 
1	but say if our deliverer up to heaven
1	must re ascend what will betide the few
1	his faithful left among the unfaithful herd 
1	the enemies of truth who then shall guide
1	his people who defend will they not deal
1	worse with his followers than with him they dealt 
1	be sure they will said the angel but from heaven
1	he to his own a comforter will send 
1	the promise of the father who shall dwell
1	his spirit within them and the law of faith 
1	working through love upon their hearts shall write 
1	to guide them in all truth and also arm
1	with spiritual armour able to resist
1	satan s assaults and quench his fiery darts 
1	what man can do against them not afraid 
1	though to the death against such cruelties
1	with inward consolations recompensed 
1	and oft supported so as shall amaze
1	their proudest persecutors for the spirit 
1	poured first on his apostles whom he sends
1	to evangelize the nations then on all
1	baptized shall them with wonderous gifts endue
1	to speak all tongues and do all miracles 
1	as did their lord before them thus they win
1	great numbers of each nation to receive
1	with joy the tidings brought from heaven at length
1	their ministry performed and race well run 
1	their doctrine and their story written left 
1	they die but in their room as they forewarn 
1	wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves 
1	who all the sacred mysteries of heaven
1	to their own vile advantages shall turn
1	of lucre and ambition and the truth
1	with superstitions and traditions taint 
1	left only in those written records pure 
1	though not but by the spirit understood 
1	then shall they seek to avail themselves of names 
1	places and titles and with these to join
1	secular power though feigning still to act
1	by spiritual to themselves appropriating
1	the spirit of god promised alike and given
1	to all believers and from that pretence 
1	spiritual laws by carnal power shall force
1	on every conscience laws which none shall find
1	left them inrolled or what the spirit within
1	shall on the heart engrave what will they then
1	but force the spirit of grace itself and bind
1	his consort liberty what but unbuild
1	his living temples built by faith to stand 
1	their own faith not another s for on earth 
1	who against faith and conscience can be heard
1	infallible yet many will presume 
1	whence heavy persecution shall arise
1	on all who in the worship persevere
1	of spirit and truth the rest far greater part 
1	will deem in outward rites and specious forms
1	religion satisfied truth shall retire
1	bestuck with slanderous darts and works of faith
1	rarely be found so shall the world go on 
1	to good malignant to bad men benign 
1	under her own weight groaning till the day
1	appear of respiration to the just 
1	and vengeance to the wicked at return
1	of him so lately promised to thy aid 
1	the woman s seed obscurely then foretold 
1	now ampler known thy saviour and thy lord 
1	last in the clouds from heaven to be revealed
1	in glory of the father to dissolve
1	satan with his perverted world then raise
1	from the conflagrant mass purged and refined 
1	new heavens new earth ages of endless date 
1	founded in righteousness and peace and love 
1	to bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss 
1	he ended and thus adam last replied 
1	how soon hath thy prediction seer blest 
1	measured this transient world the race of time 
1	till time stand fixed beyond is all abyss 
1	eternity whose end no eye can reach 
1	greatly instructed i shall hence depart 
1	greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
1	of knowledge what this vessel can contain 
1	beyond which was my folly to aspire 
1	henceforth i learn that to obey is best 
1	and love with fear the only god to walk
1	as in his presence ever to observe
1	his providence and on him sole depend 
1	merciful over all his works with good
1	still overcoming evil and by small
1	accomplishing great things by things deemed weak
1	subverting worldly strong and worldly wise
1	by simply meek that suffering for truth s sake
1	is fortitude to highest victory 
1	and to the faithful death the gate of life 
1	taught this by his example whom i now
1	acknowledge my redeemer ever blest 
1	to whom thus also the angel last replied 
1	this having learned thou hast attained the sum
1	of wisdom hope no higher though all the stars
1	thou knewest by name and all the ethereal powers 
1	all secrets of the deep all nature s works 
1	or works of god in heaven air earth or sea 
1	and all the riches of this world enjoyedst 
1	and all the rule one empire only add
1	deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith 
1	add virtue patience temperance add love 
1	by name to come called charity the soul
1	of all the rest then wilt thou not be loth
1	to leave this paradise but shalt possess
1	a paradise within thee happier far 
1	let us descend now therefore from this top
1	of speculation for the hour precise
1	exacts our parting hence and see the guards 
1	by me encamped on yonder hill expect
1	their motion at whose front a flaming sword 
1	in signal of remove waves fiercely round 
1	we may no longer stay go waken eve 
1	her also i with gentle dreams have calmed
1	portending good and all her spirits composed
1	to meek submission thou at season fit 
1	let her with thee partake what thou hast heard 
1	chiefly what may concern her faith to know 
1	the great deliverance by her seed to come
1	 for by the woman s seed on all mankind 
1	that ye may live which will be many days 
1	both in one faith unanimous though sad 
1	with cause for evils past yet much more cheered
1	with meditation on the happy end 
1	he ended and they both descend the hill 
1	descended adam to the bower where eve
1	lay sleeping ran before but found her waked 
1	and thus with words not sad she him received 
1	whence thou returnest and whither wentest i know 
1	for god is also in sleep and dreams advise 
1	which he hath sent propitious some great good
1	presaging since with sorrow and heart s distress
1	wearied i fell asleep but now lead on 
1	in me is no delay with thee to go 
1	is to stay here without thee here to stay 
1	is to go hence unwilling thou to me
1	art all things under heaven all places thou 
1	who for my wilful crime art banished hence 
1	this further consolation yet secure
1	i carry hence though all by me is lost 
1	such favour i unworthy am vouchsafed 
1	by me the promised seed shall all restore 
1	so spake our mother eve and adam heard
1	well pleased but answered not for now too nigh
1	the arch angel stood and from the other hill
1	to their fixed station all in bright array
1	the cherubim descended on the ground
1	gliding meteorous as evening mist
1	risen from a river o er the marish glides 
1	and gathers ground fast at the labourer s heel
1	homeward returning high in front advanced 
1	the brandished sword of god before them blazed 
1	fierce as a comet which with torrid heat 
1	and vapour as the libyan air adust 
1	began to parch that temperate clime whereat
1	in either hand the hastening angel caught
1	our lingering parents and to the eastern gate
1	led them direct and down the cliff as fast
1	to the subjected plain then disappeared 
1	they looking back all the eastern side beheld
1	of paradise so late their happy seat 
1	waved over by that flaming brand the gate
1	with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms 
1	some natural tears they dropt but wiped them soon 
1	the world was all before them where to choose
1	their place of rest and providence their guide 
1	they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow 
1	through eden took their solitary way 
1	 of cerberus and blackest midnight born
1	in stygian cave forlorn
1	unholy 
1	find out some uncouth cell 
1	 where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings 
1	and the night raven sings 
1	as ragged as thy locks 
1	but come thou goddess fair and free 
1	in heaven yclept euphrosyne 
1	and by men heart easing mirth 
1	whom lovely venus at a birth 
1	with two sister graces more 
1	to ivy crowned bacchus bore 
1	hence loathed melancholy 
1	or whether as some sager sing 
1	the frolic wind that breathes the spring 
1	zephyr with aurora playing 
1	as he met her once a maying 
1	there on beds of violets blue 
1	and fresh blown roses washed in dew 
1	filled her with thee a daughter fair 
1	so buxom blithe and debonair 
1	haste thee nymph and bring with thee
1	jest and youthful jollity 
1	quips and cranks and wanton wiles 
1	nods and becks and wreathed smiles
1	such as hang on hebe s cheek 
1	and love to live in dimple sleek 
1	sport that wrinkled care derides 
1	and laughter holding both his sides 
1	come and trip it as you go 
1	on the light fantastic toe 
1	and in thy right hand lead with thee
1	the mountain nymph sweet liberty 
1	and if i give thee honour due 
1	mirth admit me of thy crew 
1	to live with her and live with thee 
1	in unreproved pleasures free 
1	to hear the lark begin his flight 
1	and singing startle the dull night 
1	from his watch tower in the skies 
1	till the dappled dawn doth rise 
1	then to come in spite of sorrow 
1	and at my window bid good morrow 
1	through the sweet briar or the vine 
1	or the twisted eglantine 
1	while the cock with lively din 
1	scatters the rear of darkness thin 
1	and to the stack or the barn door 
1	stoutly struts his dames before 
1	oft listening how the hounds and horn
1	cheerly rouse the slumbering morn 
1	from the side of some hoar hill 
1	through the high wood echoing shrill 
1	sometime walking not unseen 
1	by hedgerow elms on hillocks green 
1	right against the eastern gate
1	where the great sun begins his state 
1	robed in flames and amber light 
1	the clouds in thousand liveries dight 
1	while the ploughman near at hand 
1	whistles o er the furrowed land 
1	and the milkmaid singeth blithe 
1	and the mower whets his scythe 
1	and every shepherd tells his tale
1	under the hawthorn in the dale 
1	straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures 
1	whilst the landskip round it measures 
1	russet lawns and fallows grey 
1	where the nibbling flocks do stray 
1	mountains on whose barren breast
1	the labouring clouds do often rest 
1	meadows trim with daisies pied 
1	shallow brooks and rivers wide 
1	towers and battlements it sees
1	bosomed high in tufted trees 
1	where perhaps some beauty lies 
1	the cynosure of neighbouring eyes 
1	hard by a cottage chimney smokes
1	from betwixt two aged oaks 
1	are at their savoury dinner set
1	of herbs and other country messes 
1	which the neat handed phyllis dresses 
1	and then in haste her bower she leaves 
1	with thestylis to bind the sheaves 
1	or if the earlier season lead 
1	to the tanned haycock in the mead 
1	sometimes with secure delight 
1	the upland hamlets will invite 
1	when the merry bells ring round 
1	and the jocund rebecks sound
1	to many a youth and many a maid
1	dancing in the chequered shade 
1	and young and old come forth to play
1	on a sunshine holiday 
1	till the livelong daylight fail 
1	then to the spicy nut brown ale 
1	with stories told of many a feat 
1	how faery mab the junkets eat 
1	she was pinched and pulled she said 
1	and he by friar s lantern led 
1	tells how the drudging goblin sweat
1	to earn his cream bowl duly set 
1	when in one night ere glimpse of morn 
1	his shadowy flail hath threshed the corn
1	that ten day labourers could not end 
1	then lies him down the lubber fiend 
1	and stretched out all the chimney s length 
1	basks at the fire his hairy strength 
1	and crop full out of doors he flings 
1	ere the first cock his matin rings 
1	thus done the tales to bed they creep 
1	by whispering winds soon lulled asleep 
1	towered cities please us then 
1	and the busy hum of men 
1	where throngs of knights and barons bold 
1	in weeds of peace high triumphs hold
1	with store of ladies whose bright eyes
1	rain influence and judge the prize
1	of wit or arms while both contend
1	to win her grace whom all commend 
1	there let hymen oft appear
1	in saffron robe with taper clear 
1	and pomp and feast and revelry 
1	with mask and antique pageantry 
1	such sights as youthful poets dream
1	on summer eves by haunted stream 
1	then to the well trod stage anon 
1	if jonson s learned sock be on 
1	or sweetest shakespeare fancy s child 
1	warble his native wood notes wild 
1	and ever against eating cares 
1	lap me in soft lydian airs 
1	married to immortal verse 
1	such as the meeting soul may pierce 
1	in notes with many a winding bout
1	of linked sweetness long drawn out
1	with wanton heed and giddy cunning 
1	the melting voice through mazes running 
1	untwisting all the chains that tie
1	the hidden soul of harmony 
1	that orpheus self may heave his head
1	from golden slumber on a bed
1	of heaped elysian flowers and hear
1	such strains as would have won the ear
1	of pluto to have quite set free
1	his half regained eurydice 
1	these delights if thou canst give 
1	mirth with thee i mean to live 
1	hence vain deluding joys 
1	how little you bested
1	 or fill the fixed mind with all your toys 
1	dwell in some idle brain 
1	 and fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess 
1	as thick and numberless
1	or likest hovering dreams 
1	but hail thou goddess sage and holy 
1	hail divinest melancholy 
1	whose saintly visage is too bright
1	to hit the sense of human sight 
1	and therefore to our weaker view
1	o erlaid with black staid wisdom s hue 
1	black but such as in esteem
1	prince memnon s sister might beseem 
1	or that starred ethiop queen that strove
1	to set her beauty s praise above
1	the sea nymphs and their powers offended 
1	yet thou art higher far descended 
1	thee bright haired vesta long of yore
1	to solitary saturn bore 
1	his daughter she in saturn s reign
1	such mixture was not held a stain 
1	oft in glimmering bowers and glades
1	he met her and in secret shades
1	of woody ida s inmost grove 
1	whilst yet there was no fear of jove 
1	come pensive nun devout and pure 
1	sober steadfast and demure 
1	all in a robe of darkest grain 
1	flowing with majestic train 
1	and sable stole of cypress lawn
1	over thy decent shoulders drawn 
1	come but keep thy wonted state 
1	with even step and musing gait 
1	and looks commercing with the skies 
1	thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes 
1	there held in holy passion still 
1	forget thyself to marble till
1	with a sad leaden downward cast
1	thou fix them on the earth as fast 
1	and join with thee calm peace and quiet 
1	spare fast that oft with gods doth diet 
1	and hears the muses in a ring
1	aye round about jove s altar sing 
1	and add to these retired leisure 
1	that in trim gardens takes his pleasure 
1	but first and chiefest with thee bring
1	him that yon soars on golden wing 
1	guiding the fiery wheeled throne 
1	and the mute silence hist along 
1	 less philomel will deign a song 
1	in her sweetest saddest plight 
1	smoothing the rugged brow of night 
1	while cynthia checks her dragon yoke
1	gently o er the accustomed oak 
1	sweet bird that shunn st the noise of folly 
1	most musical most melancholy 
1	thee chauntress oft the woods among
1	i woo to hear thy even song 
1	and missing thee i walk unseen
1	on the dry smooth shaven green 
1	to behold the wandering moon 
1	riding near her highest noon 
1	like one that had been led astray
1	through the heaven s wide pathless way 
1	and oft as if her head she bowed 
1	stooping through a fleecy cloud 
1	oft on a plat of rising ground 
1	i hear the far off curfew sound 
1	over some wide watered shore 
1	swinging slow with sullen roar 
1	or if the air will not permit 
1	some still removed place will fit 
1	where glowing embers through the room
1	teach light to counterfeit a gloom 
1	far from all resort of mirth 
1	save the cricket on the hearth 
1	or the bellman s drowsy charm
1	to bless the doors from nightly harm 
1	or let my lamp at midnight hour 
1	be seen in some high lonely tower 
1	with thrice great hermes or unsphere
1	the spirit of plato to unfold
1	what worlds or what vast regions hold
1	the immortal mind that hath forsook
1	her mansion in this fleshly nook 
1	and of those demons that are found
1	in fire air flood or underground 
1	whose power hath a true consent
1	with planet or with element 
1	sometime let gorgeous tragedy
1	in sceptred pall come sweeping by 
1	presenting thebes or pelops line 
1	or the tale of troy divine 
1	or what though rare of later age
1	ennobled hath the buskined stage 
1	but o sad virgin that thy power
1	might raise musaeus from his bower 
1	or bid the soul of orpheus sing
1	such notes as warbled to the string 
1	drew iron tears down pluto s cheek 
1	and made hell grant what love did seek 
1	or call up him that left half told
1	the story of cambuscan bold 
1	and who had canace to wife 
1	that owned the virtuous ring and glass 
1	and of the wondrous horse of brass
1	on which the tartar king did ride 
1	and if aught else great bards beside
1	in sage and solemn tunes have sung 
1	of turneys and of trophies hung 
1	of forests and enchantments drear 
1	where more is meant than meets the ear 
1	thus night oft see me in thy pale career 
1	till civil suited morn appear 
1	not tricked and frounced as she was wont
1	with the attic boy to hunt 
1	but kerchieft in a comely cloud
1	while rocking winds are piping loud 
1	or ushered with a shower still 
1	when the gust hath blown his fill 
1	ending on the rustling leaves 
1	with minute drops from off the eaves 
1	and when the sun begins to fling
1	his flaring beams me goddess bring
1	to arched walks of twilight groves 
1	and shadows brown that sylvan loves 
1	of pine or monumental oak 
1	where the rude axe with heaved stroke
1	was never heard the nymphs to daunt 
1	or fright them from their hallowed haunt 
1	there in close covert by some brook 
1	where no profaner eye may look 
1	hide me from day s garish eye 
1	while the bee with honeyed thigh 
1	that at her flowery work doth sing 
1	and the waters murmuring 
1	with such consort as they keep 
1	entice the dewy feathered sleep 
1	and let some strange mysterious dream
1	wave at his wings in airy stream
1	of lively portraiture displayed 
1	softly on my eyelids laid 
1	and as i wake sweet music breathe
1	above about or underneath 
1	sent by some spirit to mortals good 
1	or the unseen genius of the wood 
1	but let my due feet never fail
1	to walk the studious cloister s pale 
1	and love the high embowed roof 
1	with antique pillars massy proof 
1	and storied windows richly dight 
1	casting a dim religious light 
1	there let the pealing organ blow 
1	to the full voiced quire below 
1	in service high and anthems clear 
1	as may with sweetness through mine ear 
1	dissolve me into ecstasies 
1	and bring all heaven before mine eyes 
1	and may at last my weary age
1	find out the peaceful hermitage 
1	the hairy gown and mossy cell 
1	where i may sit and rightly spell
1	of every star that heaven doth shew 
1	and every herb that sips the dew 
1	till old experience do attain
1	to something like prophetic strain 
1	these pleasures melancholy give 
1	and i with thee will choose to live 
1	the attendant spirit afterwards in the habit of thyrsis 
1	comus with his crew 
1	sabrina the nymph 
1	the chief persons which presented were 
1	the first scene discovers a wild wood 
1	the attendant spirit descends or enters 
1	before the starry threshold of jove s court
1	my mansion is where those immortal shapes
1	of bright aerial spirits live insphered
1	in regions mild of calm and serene air 
1	above the smoke and stir of this dim spot
1	which men call earth and with low thoughted care 
1	confined and pestered in this pinfold here 
1	strive to keep up a frail and feverish being 
1	unmindful of the crown that virtue gives 
1	after this mortal change to her true servants
1	amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats 
1	yet some there be that by due steps aspire
1	to lay their just hands on that golden key
1	that opes the palace of eternity 
1	to such my errand is and but for such 
1	i would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds
1	with the rank vapours of this sin worn mould 
1	but to my task neptune besides the sway
1	of every salt flood and each ebbing stream 
1	took in by lot twixt high and nether jove 
1	imperial rule of all the sea girt isles
1	that like to rich and various gems inlay
1	the unadorned bosom of the deep 
1	which he to grace his tributary gods 
1	by course commits to several government 
1	and gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns
1	and wield their little tridents but this isle 
1	the greatest and the best of all the main 
1	he quarters to his blue haired deities 
1	and all this tract that fronts the falling sun
1	a noble peer of mickle trust and power
1	has in his charge with tempered awe to guide
1	an old and haughty nation proud in arms 
1	where his fair offspring nursed in princely lore 
1	are coming to attend their father s state 
1	and new intrusted sceptre but their way
1	lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood 
1	the nodding horror of whose shady brows
1	threats the forlorn and wandering passenger 
1	and here their tender age might suffer peril 
1	but that by quick command from sovran jove 
1	i was despatched for their defence and guard 
1	and listen why for i will tell you now
1	what never yet was heard in tale or song 
1	from old or modern bard in hall or bower 
1	bacchus that first from out the purple grape
1	crushed the sweet poison of misused wine 
1	after the tuscan mariners transformed 
1	coasting the tyrrhene shore as the winds listed 
1	on circe s island fell who knows not circe 
1	the daughter of the sun whose charmed cup
1	whoever tasted lost his upright shape 
1	and downward fell into a grovelling swine 
1	this nymph that gazed upon his clustering locks 
1	with ivy berries wreathed and his blithe youth 
1	had by him ere he parted thence a son
1	much like his father but his mother more 
1	whom therefore she brought up and comus named 
1	who ripe and frolic of his full grown age 
1	roving the celtic and iberian fields 
1	at last betakes him to this ominous wood 
1	and in thick shelter of black shades imbowered 
1	excels his mother at her mighty art 
1	offering to every weary traveller
1	his orient liquor in a crystal glass 
1	to quench the drouth of phoebus which as they taste
1	 for most do taste through fond intemperate thirst 
1	soon as the potion works their human count nance 
1	the express resemblance of the gods is changed
1	into some brutish form of wolf or bear 
1	or ounce or tiger hog or bearded goat 
1	all other parts remaining as they were 
1	and they so perfect is their misery 
1	not once perceive their foul disfigurement 
1	but boast themselves more comely than before 
1	and all their friends and native home forget 
1	to roll with pleasure in a sensual sty 
1	therefore when any favoured of high jove
1	chances to pass through this adventurous glade 
1	swift as the sparkle of a glancing star
1	i shoot from heaven to give him safe convoy 
1	as now i do but first i must put off
1	these my sky robes spun out of iris woof 
1	and take the weeds and likeness of a swain
1	that to the service of this house belongs 
1	who with his soft pipe and smooth dittied song 
1	well knows to still the wild winds when they roar 
1	and hush the waving woods nor of less faith
1	and in this office of his mountain watch
1	likeliest and nearest to the present aid
1	of this occasion but i hear the tread
1	of hateful steps i must be viewless now 
1	comus enters with a charming rod in one hand his glass in the
1	other with him a rout of monsters headed like sundry sorts of
1	beasts but otherwise like men and women their apparel
1	glistering 
1	they come in making a riotous and unruly noise with torches in
1	their hands 
1	comus the star that bids the shepherd fold
1	now the top of heaven doth hold 
1	and the gilded car of day
1	his glowing axle doth allay
1	in the steep atlantic stream 
1	and the slope sun his upward beam
1	shoots against the dusky pole 
1	pacing toward the other goal
1	of his chamber in the east 
1	meanwhile welcome joy and feast 
1	midnight shout and revelry 
1	tipsy dance and jollity 
1	braid your locks with rosy twine 
1	dropping odours dropping wine 
1	rigour now is gone to bed 
1	and advice with scrupulous head 
1	strict age and sour severity 
1	with their grave saws in slumber lie 
1	we that are of purer fire 
1	imitate the starry quire 
1	who in their nightly watchful spheres 
1	lead in swift round the months and years 
1	the sounds and seas with all their finny drove 
1	now to the moon in wavering morrice move 
1	and on the tawny sands and shelves
1	trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves 
1	by dimpled brook and fountain brim 
1	the wood nymphs decked with daisies trim 
1	their merry wakes and pastimes keep 
1	what hath night to do with sleep 
1	night hath better sweets to prove 
1	venus now wakes and wakens love 
1	come let us our rights begin 
1	 t is only daylight that makes sin 
1	which these dun shades will ne er report 
1	hail goddess of nocturnal sport 
1	dark veiled cotytto to whom the secret flame
1	of midnight torches burns mysterious dame 
1	that ne er art called but when the dragon womb
1	of stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom 
1	and makes one blot of all the air 
1	stay thy cloudy ebon chair 
1	wherein thou ridest with hecat and befriend
1	us thy vowed priests till utmost end
1	of all thy dues be done and none left out 
1	ere the blabbing eastern scout 
1	the nice morn on the indian steep 
1	from her cabined loop hole peep 
1	and to the tell tale sun descry
1	our concealed solemnity 
1	come knit hands and beat the ground
1	in a light fantastic round 
1	break off break off i feel the different pace
1	of some chaste footing near about this ground 
1	run to your shrouds within these brakes and trees 
1	our number may affright some virgin sure
1	 for so i can distinguish by mine art 
1	benighted in these woods now to my charms 
1	and to my wily trains i shall ere long
1	be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed
1	about my mother circe thus i hurl
1	my dazzling spells into the spongy air 
1	of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion 
1	and give it false presentments lest the place
1	and my quaint habits breed astonishment 
1	and put the damsel to suspicious flight 
1	which must not be for that s against my course 
1	i under fair pretence of friendly ends 
1	and well placed words of glozing courtesy 
1	baited with reasons not unplausible 
1	wind me into the easy hearted man 
1	and hug him into snares when once her eye
1	hath met the virtue of this magic dust 
1	i shall appear some harmless villager
1	whom thrift keeps up about his country gear 
1	but here she comes i fairly step aside 
1	and hearken if i may her business hear 
1	the lady enters 
1	lady this way the noise was if mine ear be true 
1	my best guide now methought it was the sound
1	of riot and ill managed merriment 
1	such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe
1	stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds 
1	when for their teeming flocks and granges full 
1	in wanton dance they praise the bounteous pan 
1	and thank the gods amiss i should be loth
1	to meet the rudeness and swilled insolence
1	of such late wassailers yet oh where else
1	shall i inform my unacquainted feet
1	in the blind mazes of this tangled wood 
1	my brothers when they saw me wearied out
1	with this long way resolving here to lodge
1	under the spreading favour of these pines 
1	stepped as they said to the next thicket side
1	to bring me berries or such cooling fruit
1	as the kind hospitable woods provide 
1	they left me then when the grey hooded even 
1	like a sad votarist in palmer s weed 
1	rose from the hindmost wheels of phoebus wain 
1	but where they are and why they came not back 
1	is now the labour of my thoughts tis likeliest
1	they had engaged their wandering steps too far 
1	and envious darkness ere they could return 
1	had stole them from me else o thievish night 
1	why shouldst thou but for some felonious end 
1	in thy dark lantern thus close up the stars
1	that nature hung in heaven and filled their lamps
1	with everlasting oil to give due light
1	to the misled and lonely traveller 
1	this is the place as well as i may guess 
1	whence even now the tumult of loud mirth
1	was rife and perfect in my listening ear 
1	yet nought but single darkness do i find 
1	what might this be a thousand fantasies
1	begin to throng into my memory 
1	of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire 
1	and airy tongues that syllable men s names
1	on sands and shores and desert wildernesses 
1	these thoughts may startle well but not astound
1	the virtuous mind that ever walks attended
1	by a strong siding champion conscience 
1	o welcome pure eyed faith white handed hope 
1	thou hovering angel girt with golden wings 
1	and thou unblemished form of chastity 
1	i see ye visibly and now believe
1	that he the supreme good to whom all things ill
1	are but as slavish officers of vengeance 
1	would send a glistering guardian if need were 
1	to keep my life and honour unassailed 
1	was i deceived or did a sable cloud
1	turn forth her silver lining on the night 
1	i did not err there does a sable cloud
1	turn forth her silver lining on the night 
1	and casts a gleam over this tufted grove 
1	i cannot hallo to my brothers but
1	such noise as i can make to be heard farthest
1	i ll venture for my new enlivened spirits
1	prompt me and they perhaps are not far off 
1	sweet echo sweetest nymph that liv st unseen
1	within thy airy shell
1	by slow meander s margent green 
1	and in the violet embroidered vale
1	where the love lorn nightingale
1	nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well 
1	canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair
1	that likest thy narcissus are 
1	o if thou have
1	hid them in some flowery cave 
1	tell me but where 
1	so may st thou be translated to the skies 
1	and give resounding grace to all heaven s harmonies 
1	comus can any mortal mixture of earth s mould
1	breathe such divine enchanting ravishment 
1	sure something holy lodges in that breast 
1	and with these raptures moves the vocal air
1	to testify his hidden residence 
1	how sweetly did they float upon the wings
1	of silence through the empty vaulted night 
1	at every fall smoothing the raven down
1	of darkness till it smiled i have oft heard
1	my mother circe with the sirens three 
1	amidst the flowery kirtled naiades 
1	culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs 
1	who as they sung would take the prisoned soul 
1	and lap it in elysium scylla wept 
1	and chid her barking waves into attention 
1	and fell charybdis murmured soft applause 
1	yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense 
1	and in sweet madness robbed it of itself 
1	but such a sacred and home felt delight 
1	such sober certainty of waking bliss 
1	i never heard till now i ll speak to her 
1	and she shall be my queen hail foreign wonder 
1	whom certain these rough shades did never breed 
1	unless the goddess that in rural shrine
1	dwell st here with pan or sylvan by blest song
1	forbidding every bleak unkindly fog
1	to touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood 
1	lady nay gentle shepherd ill is lost that praise
1	that is addressed to unattending ears 
1	not any boast of skill but extreme shift
1	how to regain my severed company 
1	compelled me to awake the courteous echo
1	to give me answer from her mossy couch 
1	comus what chance good lady hath bereft you thus 
1	lady dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth 
1	comus could that divide you from near ushering guides 
1	lady they left me weary on a grassy turf 
1	comus by falsehood or discourtesy or why 
1	lady to seek i the valley some cool friendly spring 
1	comus and left your fair side all unguarded lady 
1	lady they were but twain and purposed quick return 
1	comus perhaps forestalling night prevented them 
1	lady how easy my misfortune is to hit 
1	comus imports their loss beside the present need 
1	lady no less than if i should my brothers lose 
1	comus were they of manly prime or youthful bloom 
1	lady as smooth as hebe s their unrazored lips 
1	comus two such i saw what time the laboured ox
1	in his loose traces from the furrow came 
1	and the swinked hedger at his supper sat 
1	i saw them under a green mantling vine 
1	that crawls along the side of yon small hill 
1	plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots 
1	their port was more than human as they stood 
1	i took it for a faery vision
1	of some gay creatures of the element 
1	that in the colours of the rainbow live 
1	and play i the plighted clouds i was awe strook 
1	and as i passed i worshiped if those you seek 
1	it were a journey like the path to heaven
1	to help you find them 
1	lady gentle villager 
1	what readiest way would bring me to that place 
1	comus due west it rises from this shrubby point 
1	lady to find out that good shepherd i suppose 
1	in such a scant allowance of star light 
1	would overtask the best land pilot s art 
1	without the sure guess of well practised feet 
1	comus i know each lane and every alley green 
1	dingle or bushy dell of this wild wood 
1	and every bosky bourn from side to side 
1	my daily walks and ancient neighbourhood 
1	and if your stray attendance be yet lodged 
1	or shroud within these limits i shall know
1	ere morrow wake or the low roosted lark
1	from her thatched pallet rouse if otherwise 
1	i can conduct you lady to a low
1	but loyal cottage where you may be safe
1	till further quest 
1	lady shepherd i take thy word 
1	and trust thy honest offered courtesy 
1	which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds 
1	with smoky rafters than in tapestry halls
1	and courts of princes where it first was named 
1	and yet is most pretended in a place
1	less warranted than this or less secure 
1	i cannot be that i should fear to change it 
1	eye me blest providence and square my trial
1	to my proportioned strength shepherd lead on 
1	eld bro unmuffle ye faint stars and thou fair moon 
1	that wont st to love the traveller s benison 
1	stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud 
1	and disinherit chaos that reigns here
1	in double night of darkness and of shades 
1	or if your influence be quite dammed up
1	with black usurping mists some gentle taper 
1	though a rush candle from the wicker hole
1	of some clay habitation visit us
1	with thy long levelled rule of streaming light 
1	and thou shalt be our star of arcady 
1	sec bro or if our eyes
1	be barred that happiness might we but hear
1	the folded flocks penned in their wattled cotes 
1	or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops 
1	or whistle from the lodge or village cock
1	count the night watches to his feathery dames 
1	 t would be some solace yet some little cheering 
1	in this close dungeon of innumerous boughs 
1	but oh that hapless virgin our lost sister 
1	where may she wander now whither betake her
1	from the chill dew amongst rude burs and thistles
1	perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now 
1	or gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm
1	leans her unpillowed head fraught with sad fears 
1	what if in wild amazement and affright 
1	or while we speak within the direful grasp
1	of savage hunger or of savage heat 
1	eld bro peace brother be not over exquisite
1	to cast the fashion of uncertain evils 
1	for grant they be so while they rest unknown 
1	what need a man forestall his date of grief 
1	and run to meet what he would most avoid 
1	or if they be but false alarms of fear 
1	how bitter is such self delusion 
1	i do not think my sister so to seek 
1	or so unprincipled in virtue s book 
1	and the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever 
1	as that the single want of light and noise
1	 not being in danger as i trust she is not 
1	could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts 
1	and put them into misbecoming plight 
1	virtue could see to do what virtue would
1	by her own radiant light though sun and moon
1	were in the flat sea sunk and wisdom s self
1	oft seeks to sweet retired solitude 
1	where with her best nurse contemplation 
1	she plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings 
1	that in the various bustle of resort 
1	were all to ruffled and sometimes impaired 
1	he that has light within his own clear breast
1	may sit i the centre and enjoy bright day 
1	but he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
1	benighted walks under the mid day sun 
1	himself is his own dungeon 
1	sec bro tis most true
1	that musing meditation most affects
1	the pensive secrecy of desert cell 
1	far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds 
1	and sits as safe as in a senate house
1	for who would rob a hermit of his weeds 
1	his few books or his beads or maple dish 
1	or do his grey hairs any violence 
1	but beauty like the fair hesperian tree
1	laden with blooming gold had need the guard
1	of dragon watch with unenchanted eye
1	to save her blossoms and defend her fruit 
1	from the rash hand of bold incontinence 
1	you may as well spread out the unsunned heaps
1	of miser s treasure by an outlaw s den 
1	and tell me it is safe as bid me hope
1	danger will wink on opportunity 
1	and let a single helpless maiden pass
1	uninjured in this wild surrounding waste 
1	of night or loneliness it recks me not 
1	i fear the dread events that dog them both 
1	lest some ill greeting touch attempt the person
1	of our unowned sister 
1	eld bro i do not brother 
1	infer as if i thought my sister s state
1	secure without all doubt or controversy 
1	yet where an equal poise of hope and fear
1	does arbitrate the event my nature is
1	that i incline to hope rather than fear 
1	and gladly banish squint suspicion 
1	my sister is not so defenceless left
1	as you imagine she has a hidden strength 
1	which you remember not 
1	sec bro what hidden strength 
1	unless the strength of heaven if you mean that 
1	eld bro i mean that too but yet a hidden strength 
1	which if heaven gave it may be termed her own 
1	 tis chastity my brother chastity 
1	she that has that is clad in complete steel 
1	and like a quivered nymph with arrows keen 
1	may trace huge forests and unharboured heaths 
1	infamous hills and sandy perilous wilds 
1	where through the sacred rays of chastity 
1	no savage fierce bandite or mountaineer 
1	will dare to soil her virgin purity 
1	yea there where very desolation dwells 
1	by grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades 
1	she may pass on with unblenched majesty 
1	be it not done in pride or in presumption 
1	some say no evil thing that walks by night 
1	in fog or fire by lake or moorish fen 
1	blue meagre hag or stubborn unlaid ghost 
1	that breaks his magic chains at curfew time 
1	no goblin or swart faery of the mine 
1	hath hurtful power o er true virginity 
1	do ye believe me yet or shall i call
1	antiquity from the old schools of greece
1	to testify the arms of chastity 
1	hence had the huntress dian her dread bow
1	fair silver shafted queen for ever chaste 
1	wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness
1	and spotted mountain pard but set at nought
1	the frivolous bolt of cupid gods and men
1	feared her stern frown and she was queen o the woods 
1	what was that snaky headed gorgon shield
1	that wise minerva wore unconquered virgin 
1	wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone 
1	but rigid looks of chaste austerity 
1	and noble grace that dashed brute violence
1	with sudden adoration and blank awe 
1	so dear to heaven is saintly chastity
1	that when a soul is found sincerely so 
1	a thousand liveried angels lackey her 
1	driving far off each thing of sin and guilt 
1	and in clear dream and solemn vision
1	tell her of things that no gross ear can hear 
1	till oft converse with heavenly habitants
1	begin to cast a beam on the outward shape 
1	the unpolluted temple of the mind 
1	and turns it by degrees to the soul s essence 
1	till all be made immortal but when lust 
1	by unchaste looks loose gestures and foul talk 
1	but most by lewd and lavish act of sin 
1	lets in defilement to the inward parts 
1	the soul grows clotted by contagion 
1	imbodies and imbrutes till she quite loose
1	the divine property of her first being 
1	such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp
1	oft seen in charnel vaults and sepulchres 
1	lingering and sitting by a new made grave 
1	as loth to leave the body that it loved 
1	and linked itself by carnal sensualty
1	to a degenerate and degraded state 
1	sec bro how charming is divine philosophy 
1	not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose 
1	but musical as is apollo s lute 
1	and a perpetual feast of nectared sweets 
1	where no crude surfeit reigns 
1	list i hear
1	some far off hallo break the silent air 
1	sec bro methought so too what should it be 
1	eld bro for
1	certain 
1	either some one like us night foundered here 
1	or else some neighbour woodman or at worst 
1	some roving robber calling to his fellows 
1	sec bro heaven keep my sister again again and near 
1	best draw and stand upon our guard 
1	eld bro i ll hallo 
1	if he be friendly he comes well if not 
1	defence is a good cause and heaven be for us 
1	the attendant spirit habited like a shepherd 
1	that hallo i should know what are you speak

1	spir what voice is that my young lord speak again 
1	sec bro o brother t is my father s shepherd sure 
1	eld bro thyrsis whose artful strains have oft delayed
1	the huddling brook to hear his madrigal 
1	and sweetened every musk rose of the dale 
1	how camest thou here good swain hath any ram

1	spir o my loved master s heir and his next joy 
1	i came not here on such a trivial toy
1	as a strayed ewe or to pursue the stealth
1	of pilfering wolf not all the fleecy wealth
1	that doth enrich these downs is worth a thought
1	to this my errand and the care it brought 
1	but oh my virgin lady where is she 
1	how chance she is not in your company 
1	eld bro to tell thee sadly shepherd without blame
1	or our neglect we lost her as we came 
1	spir ay me unhappy then my fears are true 
1	eld bro what fears good thyrsis prithee briefly
1	shew 
1	spir i ll tell ye t is not vain or fabulous
1	 though so esteemed by shallow ignorance 
1	what the sage poets taught by the heavenly muse 
1	storied of old in high immortal verse
1	of dire chimeras and enchanted isles 
1	and rifted rocks whose entrance leads to hell 
1	for such there be but unbelief is blind 
1	within the navel of this hideous wood 
1	immured in cypress shades a sorcerer dwells 
1	of bacchus and of circe born great comus 
1	deep skilled in all his mother s witcheries 
1	and here to every thirsty wanderer
1	by sly enticement gives his baneful cup 
1	with many murmurs mixed whose pleasing poison
1	the visage quite transforms of him that drinks 
1	and the inglorious likeness of a beast
1	fixes instead unmoulding reason s mintage
1	charactered in the face this have i learnt
1	tending my flocks hard by i the hilly crofts
1	that brow this bottom glade whence night by night
1	he and his monstrous rout are heard to howl
1	like stabled wolves or tigers at their prey 
1	doing abhorred rites to hecate
1	in their obscured haunts of inmost bowers 
1	yet have they many baits and guileful spells
1	to inveigle and invite the unwary sense
1	of them that pass unweeting by the way 
1	this evening late by then the chewing flocks
1	had ta en their supper on the savoury herb
1	of knot grass dew besprent and were in fold 
1	i sat me down to watch upon a bank
1	with ivy canopied and interwove
1	with flaunting honeysuckle and began 
1	wrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy 
1	to meditate my rural minstrelsy 
1	till fancy had her fill but ere a close
1	the wonted roar was up amidst the woods 
1	and filled the air with barbarous dissonance 
1	at which i ceased and listened them awhile 
1	till an unusual stop of sudden silence
1	gave respite to the drowsy flighted steeds
1	that draw the litter of close curtained sleep 
1	at last a soft and solemn breathing sound
1	rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes 
1	and stole upon the air that even silence
1	was took ere she was ware and wished she might
1	deny her nature and be never more 
1	still to be so displaced i was all ear 
1	and took in strains that might create a soul
1	under the ribs of death but oh ere long
1	too well i did perceive it was the voice
1	of my most honoured lady your dear sister 
1	amazed i stood harrowed with grief and fear 
1	and o poor hapless nightingale thought i 
1	 how sweet thou sing st how near the deadly snare 
1	then down the lawns i ran with headlong haste 
1	through paths and turnings often trod by day 
1	till guided by mine ear i found the place
1	where that damned wizard hid in sly disguise
1	 for so by certain signs i knew had met
1	already ere my best speed could prevent 
1	the aidless innocent lady his wished prey 
1	who gently asked if he had seen such two 
1	supposing him some neighbour villager 
1	longer i durst not stay but soon i guessed
1	ye were the two she meant with that i sprung
1	into swift flight till i had found you here 
1	but further know i not 
1	sec bro o night and shades 
1	how are ye joined with hell in triple knot
1	against the unarmed weakness of one virgin 
1	alone and helpless is this the confidence
1	you gave me brother 
1	eld bro yes and keep it still 
1	lean on it safely not a period
1	shall be unsaid for me against the threats
1	of malice or of sorcery or that power
1	which erring men call chance this i hold firm 
1	virtue may be assailed but never hurt 
1	surprised by unjust force but not enthralled 
1	yea even that which mischief meant most harm
1	shall in the happy trial prove most glory 
1	but evil on itself shall back recoil 
1	and mix no more with goodness when at last 
1	gathered like scum and settled to itself 
1	it shall be in eternal restless change
1	self fed and self consumed if this fail 
1	the pillared firmament is rottenness 
1	and earth s base built on stubble but come let s on 
1	against the opposing will and arm of heaven
1	may never this just sword be lifted up 
1	but for that damned magician let him be girt
1	with all the grisly legions that troop
1	under the sooty flag of acheron 
1	harpies and hydras or all the monstrous forms
1	 twixt africa and ind i ll find him out 
1	and force him to return his purchase back 
1	or drag him by the curls to a foul death 
1	cursed as his life 
1	spir alas good venturous youth 
1	i love thy courage yet and bold emprise 
1	but here thy sword can do thee little stead 
1	far other arms and other weapons must
1	be those that quell the might of hellish charms 
1	he with his bare wand can unthread thy joints 
1	and crumble all thy sinews 
1	eld bro why prithee 
1	how durst thou then thyself approach so near
1	as to make this relation 
1	spir care and utmost
1	shifts
1	how to secure the lady from surprisal
1	brought to my mind a certain shepherd lad 
1	of small regard to see to yet well skilled
1	in every virtuous plant and healing herb
1	that spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray 
1	he loved me well and oft would beg me sing 
1	which when i did he on the tender grass
1	would sit and hearken even to ecstasy 
1	and in requital ope his leathern scrip 
1	and show me simples of a thousand names 
1	telling their strange and vigorous faculties 
1	amongst the rest a small unsightly root 
1	but of divine effect he culled me out 
1	the leaf was darkish and had prickles on it 
1	but in another country as he said 
1	bore a bright golden flower but not in this soil 
1	unknown and like esteemed and the dull swain
1	treads on it daily with his clouted shoon 
1	and yet more med cinal is it than that moly
1	that hermes once to wise ulysses gave 
1	he called it haemony and gave it me 
1	and bade me keep it as of sovran use
1	 gainst all enchantments mildew blast or damp 
1	or ghastly furies apparition 
1	i pursed it up but little reckoning made 
1	till now that this extremity compelled 
1	but now i find it true for by this means
1	i knew the foul enchanter though disguised 
1	entered the very lime twigs of his spells 
1	and yet came off if you have this about you
1	 as i will give you when we go you may
1	boldly assault the necromancer s hall 
1	where if he be with dauntless hardihood
1	and brandished blade rush on him break his glass 
1	and shed the luscious liquor on the ground 
1	but seize his wand though he and his curst crew
1	fierce sign of battle make and menace high 
1	or like the sons of vulcan vomit smoke 
1	yet will they soon retire if he but shrink 
1	eld bro thyrsis lead on apace i ll follow thee 
1	and some good angel bear a shield before us 
1	the scene changes to a stately palace set out with all manner of
1	whom he offers his glass which she puts by and goes about to
1	rise 
1	comus nay lady sit if i but wave this wand 
1	your nerves are all chained up in alabaster 
1	and you a statue or as daphne was 
1	root bound that fled apollo 
1	lady fool do not boast 
1	thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind
1	with all thy charms although this corporal rind
1	thou hast immanacled while heaven sees good 
1	comus why are you vexed lady why do you frown 
1	here dwell no frowns nor anger from these gates
1	sorrow flies far see here be all the pleasures
1	that fancy can beget on youthful thoughts 
1	when the fresh blood grows lively and returns
1	brisk as the april buds in primrose season 
1	and first behold this cordial julep here 
1	that flames and dances in his crystal bounds 
1	with spirits of balm and fragrant syrups mixed 
1	not that nepenthes which the wife of thone
1	is of such power to stir up joy as this 
1	to life so friendly or so cool to thirst 
1	why should you be so cruel to yourself 
1	and to those dainty limbs which nature lent
1	for gentle usage and soft delicacy 
1	but you invert the covenants of her trust 
1	and harshly deal like an ill borrower 
1	with that which you received on other terms 
1	scorning the unexempt condition
1	by which all mortal frailty must subsist 
1	refreshment after toil ease after pain 
1	that have been tired all day without repast 
1	and timely rest have wanted but fair virgin 
1	this will restore all soon 
1	lady t will not false
1	traitor 
1	 t will not restore the truth and honesty
1	that thou hast banished from thy tongue with lies 
1	was this the cottage and the safe abode
1	thou told st me of what grim aspects are these 
1	these oughly headed monsters mercy guard me 
1	hence with thy brewed enchantments foul deceiver 
1	hast thou betrayed my credulous innocence
1	with vizored falsehood and base forgery 
1	and would st thou seek again to trap me here
1	with liquorish baits fit to ensnare a brute 
1	were it a draught for juno when she banquets 
1	i would not taste thy treasonous offer none
1	but such as are good men can give good things 
1	and that which is not good is not delicious
1	to a well governed and wise appetite 
1	comus o foolishness of men that lend their ears
1	to those budge doctors of the stoic fur 
1	and fetch their precepts from the cynic tub 
1	praising the lean and sallow abstinence 
1	wherefore did nature pour her bounties forth
1	with such a full and unwithdrawing hand 
1	covering the earth with odours fruits and flocks 
1	thronging the seas with spawn innumerable 
1	but all to please and sate the curious taste 
1	and set to work millions of spinning worms 
1	that in their green shops weave the smooth haired silk 
1	to deck her sons and that no corner might
1	be vacant of her plenty in her own loins
1	she hutched the all worshipped ore and precious gems 
1	to store her children with if all the world
1	should in a pet of temperance feed on pulse 
1	drink the clear stream and nothing wear but frieze 
1	the all giver would be unthanked would be unpraised 
1	not half his riches known and yet despised 
1	and we should serve him as a grudging master 
1	who would be quite surcharged with her own weight 
1	and strangled with her waste fertility 
1	the earth cumbered and the winged air darked with plumes 
1	the herds would over multitude their lords 
1	the sea o erfraught would swell and the unsought diamonds
1	would so emblaze the forehead of the deep 
1	and so bestud with stars that they below
1	would grow inured to light and come at last
1	to gaze upon the sun with shameless brows 
1	list lady be not coy and be not cozened
1	with that same vaunted name virginity 
1	beauty is nature s coin must not be hoarded 
1	but must be current and the good thereof
1	consists in mutual and partaken bliss 
1	unsavoury in the enjoyment of itself 
1	if you let slip time like a neglected rose
1	it withers on the stalk with languished head 
1	beauty is nature s brag and must be shown
1	in courts at feasts and high solemnities 
1	where most may wonder at the workmanship 
1	it is for homely features to keep home 
1	they had their name thence coarse complexions
1	and cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply
1	the sampler and to tease the huswife s wool 
1	what need a vermeil tinctured lip for that 
1	love darting eyes or tresses like the morn 
1	there was another meaning in these gifts 
1	think what and be advised you are but young yet 
1	lady i had not thought to have unlocked my lips
1	in this unhallowed air but that this juggler
1	would think to charm my judgment as mine eyes 
1	obtruding false rules pranked in reason s garb 
1	i hate when vice can bolt her arguments
1	and virtue has no tongue to check her pride 
1	impostor do not charge most innocent nature

1	with her abundance she good cateress 
1	means her provision only to the good 
1	that live according to her sober laws 
1	and holy dictate of spare temperance 
1	if every just man that now pines with want
1	had but a moderate and beseeming share
1	of that which lewdly pampered luxury
1	now heaps upon some few with vast excess 
1	nature s full blessings would be well dispensed
1	in unsuperfluous even proportion 
1	and she no whit encumbered with her store 
1	and then the giver would be better thanked 
1	his praise due paid for swinish gluttony
1	ne er looks to heaven amidst his gorgeous feast 
1	but with besotted base ingratitude
1	crams and blasphemes his feeder shall i go on
1	or have i said enow to him that dares
1	arm his profane tongue with contemptuous words
1	against the sun clad power of chastity
1	fain would i something say yet to what end 
1	thou hast nor ear nor soul to apprehend
1	the sublime notion and high mystery
1	that must be uttered to unfold the sage
1	and serious doctrine of virginity 
1	and thou art worthy that thou shouldst not know
1	more happiness than this thy present lot 
1	enjoy your dear wit and gay rhetoric 
1	that hath so well been taught her dazzling fence 
1	thou art not fit to hear thyself convinced 
1	yet should i try the uncontrolled worth
1	of this pure cause would kindle my rapt spirits
1	to such a flame of sacred vehemence
1	and the brute earth would lend her nerves and shake 
1	till all thy magic structures reared so high 
1	were shattered into heaps o er thy false head 
1	comus she fables not i feel that i do fear
1	her words set off by some superior power 
1	and though not mortal yet a cold shuddering dew
1	dips me all o er as when the wrath of jove
1	speaks thunder and the chains of erebus
1	to some of saturn s crew i must dissemble 
1	and try her yet more strongly come no more 
1	this is mere moral babble and direct
1	against the canon laws of our foundation 
1	i must not suffer this yet t is but the lees
1	and settlings of a melancholy blood 
1	but this will cure all straight one sip of this
1	will bathe the drooping spirits in delight
1	beyond the bliss of dreams be wise and taste 
1	the brothers rush in with swords drawn wrest his glass out of
1	hand and break it against the ground his rout make sign of
1	resistance but are all driven in the attendant spirit comes in 
1	spir what have you let the false enchanter scape 
1	o ye mistook ye should have snatched his wand 
1	and bound him fast without his rod reversed 
1	and backward mutters of dissevering power 
1	we cannot free the lady that sits here
1	in stony fetters fixed and motionless 
1	yet stay be not disturbed now i bethink me 
1	some other means i have which may be used 
1	which once of meliboeus old i learnt 
1	the soothest shepherd that e er piped on plains 
1	there is a gentle nymph not far from hence 
1	that with moist curb sways the smooth severn stream 
1	sabrina is her name a virgin pure 
1	whilom she was the daughter of locrine 
1	that had the sceptre from his father brute 
1	she guiltless damsel flying the mad pursuit
1	of her enraged stepdame guendolen 
1	commended her fair innocence to the flood
1	that stayed her flight with his cross flowing course 
1	the water nymphs that in the bottom played 
1	held up their pearled wrists and took her in 
1	bearing her straight to aged nereus hall 
1	who piteous of her woes reared her lank head 
1	and gave her to his daughters to imbathe
1	in nectared lavers strewed with asphodil 
1	and through the porch and inlet of each sense
1	dropt in ambrosial oils till she revived 
1	and underwent a quick immortal change 
1	made goddess of the river still she retains
1	her maiden gentleness and oft at eve
1	visits the herds along the twilight meadows 
1	helping all urchin blasts and ill luck signs
1	that the shrewd meddling elf delights to make 
1	which she with precious vialed liquors heals 
1	for which the shepherds at their festivals 
1	carol her goodness loud in rustic lays 
1	and throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream
1	of pansies pinks and gaudy daffodils 
1	and as the old swain said she can unlock
1	the clasping charm and thaw the numbing spell 
1	if she be right invoked in warbled song 
1	for maidenhood she loves and will be swift
1	to aid a virgin such as was herself 
1	in hard besetting need this will i try 
1	and add the power of some adjuring verse 
1	sabrina fair 
1	listen where thou art sitting
1	under the glassy cool translucent wave 
1	in twisted braids of lilies knitting
1	the loose train of thy amber dropping hair 
1	listen for dear honour s sake 
1	goddess of the silver lake 
1	listen and save 
1	listen and appear to us 
1	in name of great oceanus 
1	by the earth shaking neptune s mace 
1	and tethys grave majestic pace 
1	by hoary nereus wrinkled look 
1	and the carpathian wizard s hook 
1	by scaly triton s winding shell 
1	and old soothsaying glaucus spell 
1	by leucothea s lovely hands 
1	and her son that rules the strands 
1	by thetis tinsel slippered feet 
1	and the songs of sirens sweet 
1	by dead parthenope s dear tomb 
1	and fair ligea s golden comb 
1	wherewith she sits on diamond rocks
1	sleeking her soft alluring locks 
1	by all the nymphs that nightly dance
1	upon thy streams with wily glance 
1	rise rise and heave thy rosy head
1	from thy coral paven bed 
1	and bridle in thy headlong wave 
1	till thou our summons answered have 
1	listen and save 
1	sabrina rises attended by water nymphs and sings 
1	by the rushy fringed bank 
1	where grows the willow and the osier dank 
1	my sliding chariot stays 
1	thick set with agate and the azurn sheen
1	of turkis blue and emerald green 
1	that in the channel strays 
1	whilst from off the waters fleet
1	thus i set my printless feet
1	o er the cowslip s velvet head 
1	that bends not as i tread 
1	gentle swain at thy request
1	i am here 
1	spir goddess dear 
1	we implore thy powerful hand
1	to undo the charmed band
1	of true virgin here distressed

1	to help ensnared chastity

1	thus i sprinkle on thy breast
1	drops that from my fountain pure
1	i have kept of precious cure 
1	thrice upon thy finger s tip 
1	thrice upon thy rubied lip 
1	next this marble venomed seat 
1	smeared with gums of glutinous heat 
1	i touch with chaste palms moist and cold 
1	now the spell hath lost his hold 
1	and i must haste ere morning hour
1	to wait in amphitrite s bower 
1	sabrina descends and the lady rises out of her seat 
1	spir virgin daughter of locrine 
1	sprung of old anchises line 
1	may thy brimmed waves for this
1	their full tribute never miss
1	from a thousand petty rills 
1	that tumble down the snowy hills 
1	summer drouth or singed air
1	never scorch thy tresses fair 
1	nor wet october s torrent flood
1	thy molten crystal fill with mud 
1	may thy billows roll ashore
1	the beryl and the golden ore 
1	may thy lofty head be crowned
1	with many a tower and terrace round 
1	and here and there thy banks upon
1	with groves of myrrh and cinnamon 
1	come lady while heaven lends us grace 
1	let us fly this cursed place 
1	lest the sorcerer us entice
1	with some other new device 
1	not a waste or needless sound
1	till we come to holier ground 
1	i shall be your faithful guide
1	through this gloomy covert wide 
1	and not many furlongs thence
1	is your father s residence 
1	where this night are met in state
1	many a friend to gratulate
1	his wished presence and beside
1	all the swains that there abide
1	with jigs and rural dance resort

1	and our sudden coming there
1	will double all their mirth and cheer

1	spir back shepherds back enough your play
1	till next sun shine holiday 
1	here be without duck or nod 
1	other trippings to be trod
1	of lighter toes and such court guise
1	as mercury did first devise
1	with the mincing dryades
1	on the lawns and on the leas 
1	the second song presents them to their father and mother 
1	noble lord and lady bright 
1	i have brought ye new delight 
1	here behold so goodly grown
1	three fair branches of your own 
1	heaven hath timely tried their youth 
1	their faith their patience and their truth 
1	and sent them here through hard assays
1	with a crown of deathless praise 
1	to triumph in victorious dance
1	o er sensual folly and intemperance 
1	the dances ended the spirit epiloguizes 
1	spir to the ocean now i fly 
1	and those happy climes that lie
1	where day never shuts his eye 
1	up in the broad fields of the sky 
1	there i suck the liquid air 
1	all amidst the gardens fair
1	of hesperus and his daughters three
1	that sing about the golden tree 
1	along the crisped shades and bowers
1	revels the spruce and jocund spring 
1	the graces and the rosy bosomed hours
1	thither all their bounties bring 
1	there eternal summer dwells 
1	and west winds with musky wing
1	about the cedarn alleys fling
1	nard and cassia s balmy smells 
1	iris there with humid bow
1	waters the odorous banks that blow
1	flowers of more mingled hue
1	than her purfled scarf can shew 
1	and drenches with elysian dew
1	 list mortals if your ears be true 
1	beds of hyacinth and roses 
1	where young adonis oft reposes 
1	waxing well of his deep wound 
1	in slumber soft and on the ground
1	sadly sits the assyrian queen 
1	but far above in spangled sheen 
1	celestial cupid her famed son advanced
1	holds his dear psyche sweet entranced
1	after her wandering labours long 
1	till free consent the gods among
1	make her his eternal bride 
1	and from her fair unspotted side
1	two blissful twins are to be born 
1	youth and joy so jove hath sworn 
1	but now my task is smoothly done 
1	i can fly or i can run 
1	quickly to the green earth s end 
1	where the bowed welkin slow doth bend 
1	and from thence can soar as soon
1	to the corners of the moon 
1	mortals that would follow me 
1	love virtue she alone is free 
1	she can teach ye how to climb
1	higher than the sphery chime 
1	or if virtue feeble were 
1	heaven itself would stoop to her

1	by occasion foretells the ruin of our corrupted clergy then in
1	their height 
1	yet once more o ye laurels and once more 
1	ye myrtles brown with ivy never sere 
1	i come to pluck your berries harsh and crude 
1	and with forced fingers rude
1	shatter your leaves before the mellowing year 
1	bitter constraint and sad occasion dear
1	compels me to disturb your season due 
1	for lycidas is dead dead ere his prime 
1	young lycidas and hath not left his peer 
1	who would not sing for lycidas he knew
1	himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme 
1	he must not float upon his watery bier
1	unwept and welter to the parching wind 
1	without the meed of some melodious tear 
1	begin then sisters of the sacred well
1	that from beneath the seat of jove doth spring 
1	begin and somewhat loudly sweep the string 
1	hence with denial vain and coy excuse 
1	so may some gentle muse
1	with lucky words favour my destined urn 
1	and as he passes turn 
1	and bid fair peace be to my sable shroud 
1	for we were nursed upon the self same hill 
1	fed the same flock by fountain shade and rill 
1	together both ere the high lawns appeared
1	under the opening eyelids of the morn 
1	we drove a field and both together heard
1	what time the grey fly winds her sultry horn 
1	battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night 
1	oft till the star that rose at evening bright
1	toward heaven s descent had sloped his westering wheel 
1	meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute 
1	tempered to the oaten flute 
1	rough satyrs danced and fauns with cloven heel
1	from the glad sound would not be absent long 
1	and old damoetas loved to hear our song 
1	but oh the heavy change now thou art gone 
1	now thou art gone and never must return 
1	thee shepherd thee the woods and desert caves 
1	with wild thyme and the gadding vine o ergrown 
1	and all their echoes mourn 
1	the willows and the hazel copses green 
1	shall now no more be seen
1	fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays 
1	as killing as the canker to the rose 
1	or taint worm to the weanling herds that graze 
1	or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear 
1	when first the white thorn blows 
1	such lycidas thy loss to shepherd s ear 
1	where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep
1	closed o er the head of your loved lycidas 
1	for neither were ye playing on the steep
1	where your old bards the famous druids lie 
1	nor on the shaggy top of mona high 
1	nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream 
1	ay me i fondly dream
1	rhad ye been there s for what could that have done 
1	what could the muse herself that orpheus bore 
1	the muse herself for her enchanting son 
1	whom universal nature did lament 
1	when by the rout that made the hideous roar 
1	his gory visage down the stream was sent 
1	down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore 
1	alas what boots it with uncessant care
1	to tend the homely slighted shepherd s trade 
1	and strictly meditate the thankless muse 
1	were it not better done as others use 
1	to sport with amaryllis in the shade 
1	or with the tangles of neaera s hair 
1	fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
1	 that last infirmity of noble mind 
1	to scorn delights and live laborious days 
1	but the fair guerdon when we hope to find 
1	and think to burst out into sudden blaze 
1	comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears 
1	and slits the thin spun life but not the praise 
1	phoebus replied and touched my trembling ears 
1	 fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil 
1	nor in the glistering foil
1	set off to the world nor in broad rumour lies 
1	but lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes
1	and perfect witness of all judging jove 
1	as he pronounces lastly on each deed 
1	of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed 
1	o fountain arethuse and thou honoured flood 
1	smooth sliding mincius crowned with vocal reeds 
1	that strain i heard was of a higher mood 
1	but now my oat proceeds 
1	and listens to the herald of the sea 
1	that came in neptune s plea 
1	he asked the waves and asked the felon winds 
1	what hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain 
1	and questioned every gust of rugged wings
1	that blows from off each beaked promontory 
1	they knew not of his story 
1	and sage hippotades their answer brings 
1	that not a blast was from his dungeon strayed 
1	the air was calm and on the level brine
1	sleek panope with all her sisters played 
1	it was that fatal and perfidious bark 
1	built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark 
1	that sunk so low that sacred head of thine 
1	next camus reverend sire went footing slow 
1	his mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge 
1	inwrought with figures dim and on the edge
1	like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe 
1	 ah who hath reft quoth he my dearest pledge 
1	last came and last did go 
1	two massy keys he bore of metals twain 
1	 the golden opes the iron shuts amain 
1	he shook his mitred locks and stern bespake 
1	 how well could i have spared for thee young swain 
1	enow of such as for their bellies sake 
1	creep and intrude and climb into the fold 
1	of other care they little reckoning make
1	than how to scramble at the shearers feast 
1	and shove away the worthy bidden guest 
1	blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold
1	a sheep hook or have learnt aught else the least
1	that to the faithful herdman s art belongs 
1	what recks it them what need they they are sped 
1	and when they list their lean and flashy songs
1	grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw 
1	the hungry sheep look up and are not fed 
1	but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw 
1	rot inwardly and foul contagion spread 
1	besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
1	daily devours apace and nothing said 
1	but that two handed engine at the door
1	stands ready to smite once and smite no more 
1	return alpheus the dread voice is past
1	that shrunk thy streams return sicilian muse 
1	and call the vales and bid them hither cast
1	their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues 
1	ye valleys low where the mild whispers use
1	of shades and wanton winds and gushing brooks 
1	on whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks 
1	throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes 
1	that on the green turf suck the honeyed showers 
1	and purple all the ground with vernal flowers 
1	bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies 
1	the tufted crow toe and pale jessamine 
1	the white pink and the pansy freaked with jet 
1	the glowing violet 
1	the musk rose and the well attired woodbine 
1	with cowslips wan that hang the pensive head 
1	and every flower that sad embroidery wears 
1	bid amaranthus all his beauty shed 
1	and daffadillies fill their cups with tears 
1	to strew the laureate hearse where lycid lies 
1	for so to interpose a little ease 
1	let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise 
1	ay me whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
1	wash far away where er thy bones are hurled 
1	whether beyond the stormy hebrides 
1	where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
1	visit st the bottom of the monstrous world 
1	or whether thou to our moist vows denied 
1	sleep st by the fable of bellerus old 
1	where the great vision of the guarded mount
1	looks toward namancos and bayona s hold 
1	look homeward angel now and melt with ruth 
1	and o ye dolphins waft the hapless youth 
1	weep no more woeful shepherds weep no more 
1	for lycidas your sorrow is not dead 
1	sunk though he be beneath the watery floor 
1	so sinks the day star in the ocean bed 
1	and yet anon repairs his drooping head 
1	and tricks his beams and with new spangled ore
1	flames in the forehead of the morning sky 
1	so lycidas sunk low but mounted high 
1	through the dear might of him that walked the waves 
1	where other groves and other streams along 
1	with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves 
1	and hears the unexpressive nuptial song 
1	in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love 
1	there entertain him all the saints above 
1	in solemn troops and sweet societies 
1	that sing and singing in their glory move 
1	and wipe the tears for ever from his eyes 
1	now lycidas the shepherds weep no more 
1	henceforth thou art the genius of the shore 
1	in thy large recompense and shalt be good
1	to all that wander in that perilous flood 
1	thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills 
1	while the still morn went out with sandals grey 
1	he touched the tender stops of various quills 
1	with eager thought warbling his doric lay 
1	and now the sun had stretched out all the hills 
1	and now was dropt into the western bay 
1	at last he rose and twitched his mantle blue 
1	tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new 
1	beneath the hollow round
1	on the morning of christ s nativity
1	in the puritan theology and its implications he cannot take much
1	evidently the father thought he saw in his son that promise of
1	intellectual vigor and of sound moral stamina which justified the
1	returning at the close of his university course to the paternal
1	memorable among his italian experiences was his visit to the aged
1	all students of milton have to acknowledge their indebtedness to
1	this is the month and this the happy morn 
1	wherein the son of heaven s eternal king 
1	of wedded maid and virgin mother born 
1	our great redemption from above did bring 
1	for so the holy sages once did sing 
1	that he our deadly forfeit should release 
1	and with his father work us a perpetual peace 
1	that glorious form that light unsufferable 
1	and that far beaming blaze of majesty 
1	wherewith he wont at heaven s high council table
1	to sit the midst of trinal unity 
1	he laid aside and here with us to be 
1	forsook the courts of everlasting day 
1	and chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay 
1	say heavenly muse shall not thy sacred vein
1	afford a present to the infant god 
1	hast thou no verse no hymn or solemn strain 
1	to welcome him to this his new abode 
1	now while the heaven by the sun s team untrod 
1	hath took no print of the approaching light 
1	and all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright 
1	see how from far upon the eastern road
1	the star led wizards haste with odors sweet 
1	oh run prevent them with thy humble ode 
1	and lay it lowly at his blessed feet 
1	have thou the honor first thy lord to greet 
1	and join thy voice unto the angel quire 
1	from out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire 
1	it was the winter wild 
1	while the heaven born child
1	all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies 
1	nature in awe to him 
1	had doffed her gaudy trim 
1	with her great master so to sympathize 
1	it was no season then for her
1	to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour 
1	only with speeches fair
1	she woos the gentle air
1	to hide her guilty front with innocent snow 
1	and on her naked shame 
1	pollute with sinful blame 
1	the saintly veil of maiden white to throw 
1	confounded that her maker s eyes
1	should look so near upon her foul deformities 
1	but he her fears to cease 
1	sent down the meek eyed peace 
1	she crowned with olive green came softly sliding
1	down through the turning sphere 
1	his ready harbinger 
1	with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing 
1	and waving wide her myrtle wand 
1	she strikes a universal peace through sea and land 
1	no war or battle s sound 
1	was heard the world around 
1	the idle spear and shield were high uphung 
1	the hooked chariot stood 
1	unstained with hostile blood 
1	the trumpet spake not to the armed throng 
1	and kings sat still with awful eye 
1	as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by 
1	but peaceful was the night
1	his reign of peace upon the earth began 
1	the winds with wonder whist 
1	smoothly the waters kissed 
1	whispering new joys to the mild ocean 
1	who now hath quite forgot to rave 
1	while birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave 
1	the stars with deep amaze 
1	stand fixed in steadfast gaze 
1	bending one way their precious influence 
1	and will not take their flight 
1	for all the morning light 
1	or lucifer that often warned them thence 
1	but in their glimmering orbs did glow 
1	until their lord himself bespake and bid them go 
1	and though the shady gloom
1	had given day her room 
1	the sun himself withheld his wonted speed 
1	and hid his head for shame 
1	as his inferior flame
1	the new enlightened world no more should need 
1	he saw a greater sun appear
1	than his bright throne or burning axletree could bear 
1	the shepherds on the lawn 
1	or ere the point of dawn 
1	sat simply chatting in a rustic row 
1	full little thought they than
1	that the mighty pan
1	was kindly come to live with them below 
1	perhaps their loves or else their sheep 
1	was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep 
1	when such music sweet
1	their hearts and ears did greet
1	as never was by mortal finger strook 
1	divinely warbled voice
1	answering the stringed noise 
1	as all their souls in blissful rapture took 
1	the air such pleasure loth to lose 
1	with thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close 
1	nature that heard such sound
1	of cynthia s seat the airy region thrilling 
1	now was almost won
1	to think her part was done 
1	and that her reign had here its last fulfilling 
1	she knew such harmony alone
1	could hold all heaven and earth in happier union 
1	at last surrounds their sight
1	a globe of circular light 
1	that with long beams the shamefaced night arrayed 
1	the helmed cherubim
1	and sworded seraphim
1	are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed 
1	harping in loud and solemn quire 
1	with unexpressive notes to heaven s new born heir 
1	such music as tis said 
1	before was never made 
1	but when of old the sons of morning sung 
1	while the creator great
1	his constellations set 
1	and the well balanced world on hinges hung 
1	and cast the dark foundations deep 
1	and bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep 
1	ring out ye crystal spheres 
1	once bless our human ears 
1	if ye have power to touch our senses so 
1	and let your silver chime
1	move in melodious time 
1	and let the bass of heaven s deep organ blow 
1	and with your ninefold harmony
1	make up full consort to the angelic symphony 
1	for if such holy song
1	enwrap our fancy long 
1	time will run back and fetch the age of gold 
1	and speckled vanity
1	will sicken soon and die 
1	and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould 
1	and hell itself will pass away 
1	and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day 
1	yea truth and justice then
1	will down return to men 
1	orbed in a rainbow and like glories wearing 
1	mercy will sit between 
1	throned in celestial sheen 
1	with radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering 
1	and heaven as at some festival 
1	will open wide the gates of her high palace hall 
1	but wisest fate says no 
1	this must not yet be so 
1	the babe yet lies in smiling infancy
1	that on the bitter cross
1	must redeem our loss 
1	so both himself and us to glorify 
1	yet first to those ychained in sleep 
1	the wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep 
1	with such a horrid clang
1	as on mount sinai rang 
1	while the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake 
1	the aged earth aghast
1	with terror of that blast 
1	shall from the surface to the centre shake 
1	when at the world s last session 
1	the dreadful judge in middle air shall spread his throne 
1	and then at last our bliss
1	full and perfect is 
1	but now begins for from this happy day
1	the old dragon under ground 
1	in straiter limits bound 
1	not half so far casts his usurped sway 
1	and wroth to see his kingdom fail 
1	swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail 
1	no voice or hideous hum
1	runs through the arched roof in words deceiving 
1	apollo from his shrine
1	can no more divine 
1	with hollow shriek the steep of delphos leaving 
1	no nightly trance or breathed spell 
1	inspires the pale eyed priest from the prophetic cell 
1	the lonely mountains o er 
1	and the resounding shore 
1	a voice of weeping heard and loud lament 
1	from haunted spring and dale
1	edged with poplar pale 
1	the parting genius is with sighing sent 
1	with flower inwoven tresses torn
1	the nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn 
1	in consecrated earth 
1	and on the holy hearth 
1	the lars and lemures moan with midnight plaint 
1	in urns and altars round 
1	a drear and dying sound
1	affrights the flamens at their service quaint 
1	and the chill marble seems to sweat 
1	while each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat 
1	forsake their temples dim 
1	with that twice battered god of palestine 
1	and mooned ashtaroth 
1	heaven s queen and mother both 
1	now sits not girt with tapers holy shine 
1	the lybic hammon shrinks his horn 
1	in vain the tyrian maids their wounded thammuz mourn 
1	and sullen moloch fled 
1	hath left in shadows dread
1	his burning idol all of blackest hue 
1	in vain with cymbals ring
1	they call the grisly king 
1	in dismal dance about the furnace blue 
1	the brutish gods of nile as fast 
1	isis and orus and the dog anubis haste 
1	nor is osiris seen
1	in memphian grove or green 
1	trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud 
1	nor can he be at rest
1	within his sacred chest 
1	nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud 
1	in vain with timbrelled anthems dark 
1	the sable stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark 
1	he feels from juda s land
1	the dreaded infant s hand 
1	the rays of bethlehem blind his dusky eyn 
1	nor all the gods beside
1	longer dare abide 
1	not typhon huge ending in snaky twine 
1	our babe to show his godhead true 
1	can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew 
1	so when the sun in bed 
1	curtained with cloudy red 
1	pillows his chin upon an orient wave 
1	the flocking shadows pale
1	troop to the infernal jail 
1	each fettered ghost slips to his several grave 
1	and the yellow skirted fays
1	fly after the night steeds leaving their moon loved maze 
1	but see the virgin blest
1	hath laid her babe to rest 
1	time is our tedious song should here have ending 
1	heaven s youngest teemed star
1	hath fixed her polished car 
1	her sleeping lord with handmaid lamp attending 
1	and all about the courtly stable
1	bright harnessed angels sit in order serviceable 
1	what needs my shakespeare for his honored bones
1	the labor of an age in piled stones 
1	or that his hallowed reliques should be hid
1	under a star ypointing pyramid 
1	dear son of memory great heir of fame 
1	what need st thou such weak witness of thy name 
1	thou in our wonder and astonishment
1	hast built thyself a livelong monument 
1	for whilst to the shame of slow endeavoring art
1	thy easy numbers flow and that each heart
1	hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book
1	those delphic lines with deep impression took 
1	then thou our fancy of itself bereaving 
1	dost make us marble with too much conceiving 
1	and so sepulchred in such pomp dost lie
1	that kings for such a tomb would wish to die 
1	hence loathed melancholy 
1	of cerberus and blackest midnight born
1	in stygian cave forlorn
1	 mongst horrid shapes and shrieks and sights unholy 
1	find out some uncouth cell 
1	where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings 
1	and the night raven sings 
1	there under ebon shades and low browed rocks 
1	as ragged as thy locks 
1	in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell 
1	but come thou goddess fair and free 
1	in heaven yclept euphrosyne 
1	and by men heart easing mirth 
1	whom lovely venus at a birth 
1	with two sister graces more 
1	to ivy crowned bacchus bore 
1	or whether as some sager sing 
1	the frolic wind that breathes the spring 
1	zephyr with aurora playing 
1	as he met her once a maying 
1	there on beds of violets blue 
1	and fresh blown roses washed in dew 
1	filled her with thee a daughter fair 
1	so buxom blithe and debonair 
1	haste thee nymph and bring with thee
1	jest and youthful jollity 
1	quips and cranks and wanton wiles 
1	nods and becks and wreathed smiles 
1	such as hang on hebe s cheek 
1	and love to live in dimple sleek 
1	sport that wrinkled care derides 
1	and laughter holding both his sides 
1	come and trip it as you go 
1	on the light fantastic toe 
1	and in thy right hand lead with thee
1	the mountain nymph sweet liberty 
1	and if i give thee honor due 
1	mirth admit me of thy crew 
1	to live with her and live with thee 
1	in unreproved pleasures free 
1	to hear the lark begin his flight 
1	and singing startle the dull night 
1	from his watch tower in the skies 
1	till the dappled dawn doth rise 
1	then to come in spite of sorrow 
1	and at my window bid good morrow 
1	through the sweet briar or the vine 
1	or the twisted eglantine 
1	while the cock with lively din 
1	scatters the rear of darkness thin 
1	and to the stack or the barn door 
1	stoutly struts his dames before 
1	oft listening how the hounds and horn
1	cheerly rouse the slumbering morn 
1	from the side of some hoar hill 
1	through the high wood echoing shrill 
1	sometime walking not unseen 
1	by hedgerow elms on hillocks green 
1	right against the eastern gate
1	where the great sun begins his state 
1	robed in flames and amber light 
1	the clouds in thousand liveries dight 
1	while the ploughman near at hand 
1	whistles o er the furrowed land 
1	and the milkmaid singeth blithe 
1	and the mower whets his scythe 
1	and every shepherd tells his tale
1	under the hawthorn in the dale 
1	straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures 
1	whilst the landskip round it measures 
1	russet lawns and fallows gray 
1	where the nibbling flocks do stray 
1	mountains on whose barren breast
1	the laboring clouds do often rest 
1	meadows trim with daisies pied 
1	shallow brooks and rivers wide 
1	towers and battlements it sees
1	bosomed high in tufted trees 
1	where perhaps some beauty lies 
1	the cynosure of neighboring eyes 
1	hard by a cottage chimney smokes
1	from betwixt two aged oaks 
1	are at their savory dinner set
1	of herbs and other country messes 
1	which the neat handed phyllis dresses 
1	and then in haste her bower she leaves 
1	with thestylis to bind the sheaves 
1	or if the earlier season lead 
1	to the tanned haycock in the mead 
1	sometimes with secure delight 
1	the upland hamlets will invite 
1	when the merry bells ring round 
1	and the jocund rebecks sound
1	to many a youth and many a maid
1	dancing in the chequered shade 
1	and young and old come forth to play
1	on a sunshine holiday 
1	till the livelong daylight fail 
1	then to the spicy nut brown ale 
1	with stories told of many a feat 
1	how faery mab the junkets eat 
1	she was pinched and pulled she said 
1	and he by friar s lantern led 
1	tells how the drudging goblin sweat
1	to earn his cream bowl duly set 
1	when in one night ere glimpse of morn 
1	his shadowy flail hath threshed the corn
1	that ten day laborers could not end 
1	then lies him down the lubber fiend 
1	and stretched out all the chimney s length 
1	basks at the fire his hairy strength 
1	and crop full out of doors he flings 
1	ere the first cock his matin rings 
1	thus done the tales to bed they creep 
1	by whispering winds soon lulled asleep 
1	towered cities please us then 
1	and the busy hum of men 
1	where throngs of knights and barons bold 
1	in weeds of peace high triumphs hold 
1	with store of ladies whose bright eyes
1	rain influence and judge the prize
1	of wit or arms while both contend
1	to win her grace whom all commend 
1	there let hymen oft appear
1	in saffron robe with taper clear 
1	and pomp and feast and revelry 
1	with mask and antique pageantry 
1	such sights as youthful poets dream 
1	on summer eves by haunted stream 
1	then to the well trod stage anon 
1	if jonson s learned sock be on 
1	or sweetest shakespeare fancy s child 
1	warble his native wood notes wild 
1	and ever against eating cares 
1	lap me in soft lydian airs 
1	married to immortal verse 
1	such as the meeting soul may pierce 
1	in notes with many a winding bout
1	of linked sweetness long drawn out
1	with wanton heed and giddy cunning 
1	the melting voice through mazes running 
1	untwisting all the chains that tie
1	the hidden soul of harmony 
1	that orpheus self may heave his head
1	from golden slumber on a bed
1	of heaped elysian flowers and hear
1	such strains as would have won the ear
1	of pluto to have quite set free
1	his half regained eurydice 
1	these delights if thou canst give 
1	mirth with thee i mean to live 
1	hence vain deluding joys 
1	the brood of folly without father bred 
1	how little you bested 
1	or fill the fixed mind with all your toys 
1	dwell in some idle brain 
1	and fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess 
1	as thick and numberless
1	as the gay motes that people the sun beams 
1	or likest hovering dreams 
1	the fickle pensioners of morpheus train 
1	but hail thou goddess sage and holy 
1	hail divinest melancholy 
1	whose saintly visage is too bright
1	to hit the sense of human sight 
1	and therefore to our weaker view 
1	o erlaid with black staid wisdom s hue 
1	black but such as in esteem
1	prince memnon s sister might beseem 
1	or that starred ethiop queen that strove
1	to set her beauty s praise above
1	the sea nymphs and their powers offended 
1	yet thou art higher far descended 
1	thee bright haired vesta long of yore
1	to solitary saturn bore 
1	his daughter she in saturn s reign
1	such mixture was not held a stain 
1	oft in glimmering bowers and glades
1	he met her and in secret shades
1	of woody ida s inmost grove 
1	whilst yet there was no fear of jove 
1	come pensive nun devout and pure 
1	sober steadfast and demure 
1	all in a robe of darkest grain 
1	flowing with majestic train 
1	and sable stole of cypress lawn
1	over thy decent shoulders drawn 
1	come but keep thy wonted state 
1	with even step and musing gait 
1	and looks commercing with the skies
1	thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes 
1	there held in holy passion still 
1	forget thyself to marble till
1	with a sad leaden downward cast
1	thou fix them on the earth as fast 
1	and join with thee calm peace and quiet 
1	spare fast that oft with gods doth diet 
1	and hears the muses in a ring
1	aye round about jove s altar sing 
1	and add to these retired leisure 
1	that in trim gardens takes his pleasure 
1	but first and chiefest with thee bring
1	him that yon soars on golden wing 
1	guiding the fiery wheeled throne 
1	and the mute silence hist along 
1	 less philomel will deign a song 
1	in her sweetest saddest plight 
1	smoothing the rugged brow of night 
1	while cynthia checks her dragon yoke
1	gently o er the accustomed oak 
1	sweet bird that shunn st the noise of folly 
1	most musical most melancholy 
1	thee chauntress oft the woods among
1	i woo to hear thy even song 
1	and missing thee i walk unseen
1	on the dry smooth shaven green 
1	to behold the wandering moon 
1	riding near her highest noon 
1	like one that had been led astray
1	through the heaven s wide pathless way 
1	and oft as if her head she bowed 
1	stooping through a fleecy cloud 
1	oft on a plat of rising ground 
1	i hear the far off curfew sound 
1	over some wide watered shore 
1	swinging slow with sullen roar 
1	or if the air will not permit 
1	some still removed place will fit 
1	where glowing embers through the room
1	teach light to counterfeit a gloom 
1	far from all resort of mirth 
1	save the cricket on the hearth 
1	or the bellman s drowsy charm
1	to bless the doors from nightly harm 
1	or let my lamp at midnight hour 
1	be seen in some high lonely tower 
1	with thrice great hermes or unsphere
1	the spirit of plato to unfold
1	what worlds or what vast regions hold
1	the immortal mind that hath forsook
1	her mansion in this fleshly nook 
1	and of those demons that are found
1	in fire air flood or underground 
1	whose power hath a true consent
1	with planet or with element 
1	sometime let gorgeous tragedy
1	in sceptred pall come sweeping by 
1	presenting thebes or pelops line 
1	or the tale of troy divine 
1	or what though rare of later age
1	ennobled hath the buskined stage 
1	but o sad virgin that thy power
1	might raise musaeus from his bower 
1	or bid the soul of orpheus sing
1	such notes as warbled to the string 
1	drew iron tears down pluto s cheek 
1	and made hell grant what love did seek 
1	or call up him that left half told
1	the story of cambuscan bold 
1	and who had canace to wife 
1	that owned the virtuous ring and glass 
1	and of the wondrous horse of brass
1	on which the tartar king did ride 
1	and if aught else great bards beside
1	in sage and solemn tunes have sung 
1	of turneys and of trophies hung 
1	of forests and enchantments drear 
1	where more is meant than meets the ear 
1	thus night oft see me in thy pale career 
1	till civil suited morn appear 
1	not tricked and frounced as she was wont
1	with the attic boy to hunt 
1	but kerchieft in a comely cloud 
1	while rocking winds are piping loud
1	or ushered with a shower still 
1	when the gust hath blown his fill 
1	ending on the rustling leaves 
1	with minute drops from off the eaves 
1	and when the sun begins to fling
1	his flaring beams me goddess bring
1	to arched walks of twilight groves 
1	and shadows brown that sylvan loves 
1	of pine or monumental oak 
1	where the rude axe with heaved stroke
1	was never heard the nymphs to daunt 
1	or fright them from their hallowed haunt 
1	there in close covert by some brook 
1	where no profaner eye may look 
1	hide me from day s garish eye 
1	while the bee with honeyed thigh 
1	that at her flowery work doth sing 
1	and the waters murmuring 
1	with such consort as they keep 
1	entice the dewy feathered sleep 
1	and let some strange mysterious dream
1	wave at his wings in airy stream
1	of lively portraiture displayed 
1	softly on my eyelids laid 
1	and as i wake sweet music breathe
1	above about or underneath 
1	sent by some spirit to mortals good 
1	or the unseen genius of the wood 
1	but let my due feet never fail
1	to walk the studious cloister s pale 
1	and love the high embowed roof 
1	with antique pillars massy proof 
1	and storied windows richly dight 
1	casting a dim religious light 
1	there let the pealing organ blow 
1	to the full voiced quire below 
1	in service high and anthems clear 
1	as may with sweetness through mine ear 
1	dissolve me into ecstasies 
1	and bring all heaven before mine eyes 
1	and may at last my weary age
1	find out the peaceful hermitage 
1	the hairy gown and mossy cell 
1	where i may sit and rightly spell
1	of every star that heaven doth shew 
1	and every herb that sips the dew 
1	till old experience do attain
1	to something like prophetic strain 
1	these pleasures melancholy give 
1	and i with thee will choose to live 
1	look nymphs and shepherds look 
1	what sudden blaze of majesty
1	is that which we from hence descry 
1	too divine to be mistook 
1	this this is she
1	to whom our vows and wishes bend 
1	here our solemn search hath end 
1	fame that her high worth to raise
1	seemed erst so lavish and profuse 
1	we may justly now accuse
1	of detraction from her praise 
1	less than half we find expressed 
1	envy bid conceal the rest 
1	mark what radiant state she spreads 
1	in circle round her shining throne
1	shooting her beams like silver threads 
1	this this is she alone 
1	sitting like a goddess bright
1	in the centre of her light 
1	might she the wise latona be 
1	or the towered cybele 
1	mother of a hundred gods 
1	juno dares not give her odds 
1	who had thought this clime had held
1	a deity so unparalleled 
1	as they come forward the genius of the wood appears 
1	and turning toward them speaks 
1	 gen stay gentle swains for though in this disguise 
1	i see bright honor sparkle through your eyes 
1	of famous arcady ye are and sprung
1	of that renowned flood so often sung 
1	divine alpheus who by secret sluice 
1	stole under seas to meet his arethuse 
1	and ye the breathing roses of the wood 
1	fair silver buskined nymphs as great and good 
1	i know this quest of yours and free intent
1	was all in honor and devotion meant
1	to the great mistress of yon princely shrine 
1	whom with low reverence i adore as mine 
1	and with all helpful service will comply
1	to further this night s glad solemnity 
1	and lead ye where ye may more near behold
1	what shallow searching fame hath left untold 
1	which i full oft amidst those shades alone 
1	have sat to wonder at and gaze upon 
1	for know by lot from jove i am the power
1	of this fair wood and live in oaken bower 
1	to nurse the saplings tall and curl the grove
1	with ringlets quaint and wanton windings wove 
1	and all my plants i save from nightly ill
1	of noisome winds and blasting vapors chill 
1	and from the boughs brush off the evil dew 
1	and heal the harms of thwarting thunder blue 
1	or what the cross dire looking planet smites 
1	or hurtful worm with cankered venom bites 
1	when evening gray doth rise i fetch my round
1	over the mount and all this hallowed ground 
1	and early ere the odorous breath of morn
1	awakes the slumbering leaves or tasselled horn
1	shakes the high thicket haste i all about 
1	number my ranks and visit every sprout
1	with puissant words and murmurs made to bless 
1	but else in deep of night when drowsiness
1	hath locked up mortal sense then listen i
1	to the celestial sirens harmony 
1	that sit upon the nine infolded spheres 
1	and sing to those that hold the vital shears 
1	and turn the adamantine spindle round
1	on which the fate of gods and men is wound 
1	such sweet compulsion doth in music lie 
1	to lull the daughters of necessity 
1	and keep unsteady nature to her law 
1	and the low world in measured motion draw
1	after the heavenly tune which none can hear
1	of human mould with gross unpurged ear 
1	and yet such music worthiest were to blaze
1	the peerless height of her immortal praise
1	whose lustre leads us and for her most fit 
1	if my inferior hand or voice could hit
1	inimitable sounds yet as we go 
1	whate er the skill of lesser gods can show
1	i will assay her worth to celebrate 
1	and so attend ye toward her glittering state 
1	where ye may all that are of noble stem 
1	approach and kiss her sacred vesture s hem 
1	o er the smooth enamelled green 
1	where no print of step hath been 
1	follow me as i sing
1	and touch the warbled string 
1	under the shady roof
1	of branching elm star proof
1	i will bring you where she sits 
1	clad in splendor as befits
1	her deity 
1	such a rural queen
1	all arcadia hath not seen 
1	nymphs and shepherds dance no more
1	by sandy ladon s lilied banks 
1	on old lycaeus or cyllene hoar 
1	trip no more in twilight ranks 
1	though erymanth your loss deplore 
1	a better soil shall give ye thanks 
1	from the stony maenalus
1	bring your flocks and live with us 
1	here ye shall have greater grace 
1	to serve the lady of this place 
1	though syrinx your pan s mistress were 
1	yet syrinx well might wait on her 
1	such a rural queen
1	all arcadia hath not seen 
1	blest pair of sirens pledges of heaven s joy 
1	sphere born harmonious sisters voice and verse 
1	wed your divine sounds and mixed power employ 
1	dead things with inbreathed sense able to pierce 
1	and to our high raised phantasy present
1	that undisturbed song of pure concent 
1	aye sung before the sapphire colored throne
1	to him that sits thereon 
1	with saintly shout and solemn jubilee 
1	where the bright seraphim in burning row
1	their loud uplifted angel trumpets blow 
1	and the cherubic host in thousand quires
1	touch their immortal harps of golden wires 
1	with those just spirits that wear victorious palms 
1	hymns devout and holy psalms
1	singing everlastingly 
1	that we on earth with undiscording voice 
1	may rightly answer that melodious noise 
1	as once we did till disproportioned sin
1	jarred against nature s chime and with harsh din
1	broke the fair music that all creatures made
1	to their great lord whose love their motion swayed
1	in perfect diapason whilst they stood
1	in first obedience and their state of good 
1	o may we soon again renew that song 
1	and keep in tune with heaven till god ere long
1	to his celestial consort us unite 
1	to live with him and sing in endless morn of light 
1	the attendant spirit afterwards in the habit of thyrsis 
1	comus with his crew 
1	the first scene discovers a wild wood 
1	the attendant spirit descends or enters 
1	 spirit before the starry threshold of jove s court
1	my mansion is where those immortal shapes
1	of bright aerial spirits live insphered
1	in regions mild of calm and serene air 
1	above the smoke and stir of this dim spot
1	which men call earth and with low thoughted care 
1	confined and pestered in this pinfold here 
1	strive to keep up a frail and feverish being 
1	unmindful of the crown that virtue gives 
1	after this mortal change to her true servants
1	amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats 
1	yet some there be that by due steps aspire
1	to lay their just hands on that golden key
1	that opes the palace of eternity 
1	to such my errand is and but for such 
1	i would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds
1	with the rank vapors of this sin worn mould 
1	but to my task neptune besides the sway
1	of every salt flood and each ebbing stream
1	took in by lot twixt high and nether jove 
1	imperial rule of all the sea girt isles
1	that like to rich and various gems inlay
1	the unadorned bosom of the deep 
1	which he to grace his tributary gods 
1	by course commits to several government 
1	and gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns
1	and wield their little tridents but this isle 
1	the greatest and the best of all the main 
1	he quarters to his blue haired deities 
1	and all this tract that fronts the falling sun
1	a noble peer of mickle trust and power
1	has in his charge with tempered awe to guide
1	an old and haughty nation proud in arms 
1	where his fair offspring nursed in princely lore 
1	are coming to attend their father s state 
1	and new intrusted sceptre but their way
1	lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood 
1	the nodding horror of those shady brows
1	threats the forlorn and wandering passenger 
1	and here their tender age might suffer peril 
1	but that by quick command from sovran jove 
1	i was despatched for their defence and guard 
1	and listen why for i will tell you now
1	what never yet was heard in tale or song 
1	from old or modern bard in hall or bower

1	on circe s island fell who knows not circe 
1	the daughter of the sun whose charmed cup
1	whoever tasted lost his upright shape 
1	and downward fell into a grovelling swine 
1	this nymph that gazed upon his clustering locks 
1	with ivy berries wreathed and his blithe youth

1	who ripe and frolic of his full grown age 
1	roving the celtic and iberian fields 
1	at last betakes him to this ominous wood 
1	and in thick shelter of black shades imbowered 
1	excels his mother at her mighty art 
1	offering to every weary traveller
1	his orient liquor in a crystal glass 
1	to quench the drouth of phoebus which as they taste
1	 for most do taste through fond intemperate thirst

1	not once perceive their foul disfigurement 
1	but boast themselves more comely than before

1	to roll with pleasure in a sensual sty 
1	therefore when any favored of high jove
1	chances to pass through this adventurous glade 
1	swift as the sparkle of a glancing star
1	i shoot from heaven to give him safe convoy 
1	as now i do but first i must put off
1	these my sky robes spun out of iris woof 
1	and take the weeds and likeness of a swain
1	that to the service of this house belongs 
1	who with his soft pipe and smooth dittied song 
1	well knows to still the wild winds when they roar 
1	and hush the waving woods nor of less faith 
1	and in this office of his mountain watch
1	likeliest and nearest to the present aid
1	of this occasion but i hear the tread
1	of hateful steps i must be viewless now 
1	 comus the star that bids the shepherd fold
1	now the top of heaven doth hold 
1	and the gilded car of day
1	his glowing axle doth allay
1	in the steep atlantic stream 
1	and the slope sun his upward beam
1	shoots against the dusky pole 
1	pacing toward the other goal

1	the sounds and seas with all their finny drove 
1	now to the moon in wavering morrice move 
1	and on the tawny sands and shelves
1	trip the pert fairies and the dapper elves 
1	by dimpled brook and fountain brim 
1	the wood nymphs decked with daisies trim 
1	their merry wakes and pastimes keep 
1	what hath night to do with sleep

1	that ne er art called but when the dragon womb
1	of stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom 
1	and makes one blot of all the air

1	our number may affright some virgin sure
1	 for so i can distinguish by mine art 
1	benighted in these woods now to my charms 
1	and to my wily trains i shall ere long
1	be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed
1	about my mother circe thus i hurl
1	my dazzling spells into the spongy air 
1	of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion 
1	and give it false presentments lest the place
1	and my quaint habits breed astonishment 
1	and put the damsel to suspicious flight 
1	which must not be for that s against my course 
1	i under fair pretence of friendly ends 
1	and well placed words of glozing courtesy 
1	baited with reasons not unplausible 
1	wind me into the easy hearted man 
1	and hug him into snares when once her eye
1	hath met the virtue of this magic dust
1	i shall appear some harmless villager 
1	whom thrift keeps up about his country gear 
1	but here she comes i fairly step aside 
1	and hearken if i may her business hear 
1	the lady enters 
1	 lady this way the noise was if mine ear be true 
1	my best guide now methought it was the sound
1	of riot and ill managed merriment 
1	such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe
1	stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds 
1	when for their teeming flocks and granges full 
1	in wanton dance they praise the bounteous pan 
1	and thank the gods amiss i should be loth
1	to meet the rudeness and swilled insolence
1	of such late wassailers yet oh where else
1	shall i inform my unacquainted feet
1	in the blind mazes of this tangled wood 
1	my brothers when they saw me wearied out
1	with this long way resolving here to lodge
1	under the spreading favor of these pines 
1	stepped as they said to the next thicket side
1	to bring me berries or such cooling fruit
1	as the kind hospitable woods provide 
1	they left me then when the gray hooded even 
1	like a sad votarist in palmer s weed 
1	rose from the hindmost wheels of phoebus wain 
1	but where they are and why they came not back 
1	is now the labor of my thoughts tis likeliest
1	they had engaged their wandering steps too far 
1	and envious darkness ere they could return 
1	had stole them from me else o thievish night 
1	why shouldst thou but for some felonious end 
1	in thy dark lantern thus close up the stars
1	that nature hung in heaven and filled their lamps
1	with everlasting oil to give due light
1	to the misled and lonely traveller 
1	this is the place as well as i may guess 
1	whence even now the tumult of loud mirth
1	was rife and perfect in my listening ear 
1	yet nought but single darkness do i find 
1	what might this be a thousand fantasies
1	begin to throng into my memory 
1	of calling shapes and beckoning shadows dire 
1	and airy tongues that syllable men s names
1	on sands and shores and desert wildernesses 
1	these thoughts may startle well but not astound
1	the virtuous mind that ever walks attended
1	by a strong siding champion conscience 
1	o welcome pure eyed faith white handed hope 
1	thou hovering angel girt with golden wings 
1	and thou unblemished form of chastity 
1	i see thee visibly and now believe
1	that he the supreme good to whom all things ill
1	are but as slavish officers of vengeance 
1	would send a glistering guardian if need were 
1	to keep my life and honor unassailed 
1	was i deceived or did a sable cloud
1	turn forth her silver lining on the night 
1	i did not err there does a sable cloud
1	turn forth her silver lining on the night 
1	and casts a gleam over this tufted grove 
1	i cannot hallo to my brothers but
1	such noise as i can make to be heard farthest
1	i ll venture for my new enlivened spirits
1	prompt me and they perhaps are not far off 
1	sweet echo sweetest nymph that liv st unseen
1	within thy airy shell
1	by slow meander s margent green 
1	and in the violet embroidered vale
1	where the love lorn nightingale
1	nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well 
1	canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair
1	that likest thy narcissus are 
1	o if thou have
1	hid them in some flowery cave 
1	tell me but where 
1	so may st thou be translated to the skies 
1	and give resounding grace to all heaven s harmonies 
1	 comus can any mortal mixture of earth s mould
1	breathe such divine enchanting ravishment 
1	sure something holy lodges in that breast 
1	and with these raptures moves the vocal air
1	to testify his hidden residence 
1	how sweetly did they float upon the wings
1	of silence through the empty vaulted night 
1	at every fall smoothing the raven down
1	of darkness till it smiled i have oft heard
1	my mother circe with the sirens three 
1	amidst the flowery kirtled naiades 
1	culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs 
1	who as they sung would take the prisoned soul 
1	and lap it in elysium scylla wept 
1	and chid her barking waves into attention 
1	and fell charybdis murmured soft applause 
1	yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense 
1	and in sweet madness robbed it of itself 
1	but such a sacred and home felt delight 
1	such sober certainty of waking bliss 
1	i never heard till now i ll speak to her 
1	and she shall be my queen hail foreign wonder 
1	whom certain these rough shades did never breed 
1	unless the goddess that in rural shrine
1	dwell st here with pan or sylvan by blest song
1	forbidding every bleak unkindly fog
1	to touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood 
1	 lady nay gentle shepherd ill is lost that praise
1	that is addressed to unattending ears 
1	not any boast of skill but extreme shift
1	how to regain my severed company 
1	compelled me to awake the courteous echo
1	to give me answer from her mossy couch 
1	 comus what chance good lady hath bereft you thus 
1	 lady dim darkness and this leavy labyrinth 
1	 comus could that divide you from near ushering guides 
1	 lady they left me weary on a grassy turf 
1	 comus by falsehood or discourtesy or why 
1	 lady to seek i the valley some cool friendly spring 
1	 comus and left your fair side all unguarded lady 
1	 lady they were but twain and purposed quick return 
1	 comus perhaps forestalling night prevented them 
1	 lady how easy my misfortune is to hit 
1	 comus imports their loss beside the present need 
1	 lady no less than if i should my brothers lose 
1	 comus were they of manly prime or youthful bloom 
1	 lady as smooth as hebe s their unrazored lips 
1	 comus two such i saw what time the labored ox
1	in his loose traces from the furrow came 
1	and the swinked hedger at his supper sat 
1	i saw them under a green mantling vine 
1	that crawls along the side of yon small hill 
1	plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots 
1	their port was more than human as they stood 
1	i took it for a faery vision
1	of some gay creatures of the element 
1	that in the colors of the rainbow live 
1	and play i the plighted clouds i was awe strook 
1	and as i passed i worshiped if those you seek 
1	it were a journey like the path to heaven
1	to help you find them 
1	 lady gentle villager 
1	what readiest way would bring me to that place 
1	 comus due west it rises from this shrubby point 
1	 lady to find out that good shepherd i suppose 
1	in such a scant allowance of star light 
1	would overtask the best land pilot s art 
1	without the sure guess of well practised feet 
1	 comus i know each lane and every alley green 
1	dingle or bushy dell of this wild wood 
1	and every bosky bourn from side to side

1	and if your stray attendance be yet lodged 
1	or shroud within these limits i shall know
1	ere morrow wake or the low roosted lark

1	i can conduct you lady to a low
1	but loyal cottage where you may be safe
1	till further quest 
1	 lady shepherd i take thy word 
1	and trust thy honest offered courtesy 
1	which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds 
1	with smoky rafters than in tapestry halls
1	and courts of princes where it first was named 
1	and yet is most pretended in a place
1	less warranted than this or less secure 
1	i cannot be that i should fear to change it

1	and disinherit chaos that reigns here

1	or if your influence be quite dammed up
1	with black usurping mists some gentle taper

1	and thou shalt be our star of arcady 
1	 sec bro or if our eyes

1	or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops 
1	or whistle from the lodge or village cock

1	 twould be some solace yet some little cheering 
1	in this close dungeon of innumerous boughs 
1	but oh that hapless virgin our lost sister 
1	where may she wander now whither betake her
1	from the chill dew amongst rude burs and thistles 
1	perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now 
1	or gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm
1	leans her unpillowed head fraught with sad fears 
1	what if in wild amazement and affright 
1	or while we speak within the direful grasp
1	of savage hunger or of savage heat 
1	 eld bro peace brother be not over exquisite
1	to cast the fashion of uncertain evils 
1	for grant they be so while they rest unknown 
1	what need a man forestall his date of grief 
1	and run to meet what he would most avoid 
1	or if they be but false alarms of fear 
1	how bitter is such self delusion 
1	i do not think my sister so to seek 
1	or so unprincipled in virtue s book 
1	and the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever 
1	as that the single want of light and noise
1	 not being in danger as i trust she is not 
1	could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts 
1	and put them into misbecoming plight 
1	virtue could see to do what virtue would
1	by her own radiant light though sun and moon
1	were in the flat sea sunk and wisdom s self
1	oft seeks to sweet retired solitude 
1	where with her best nurse contemplation 
1	she plumes her feathers and lets grow her wings 
1	that in the various bustle of resort 
1	were all to ruffled and sometimes impaired 
1	he that has light within his own clear breast
1	may sit i the centre and enjoy bright day 
1	but he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
1	benighted walks under the mid day sun 
1	himself is his own dungeon 
1	 sec bro tis most true
1	that musing meditation most affects
1	the pensive secrecy of desert cell 
1	far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds 
1	and sits as safe as in a senate house 
1	for who would rob a hermit of his weeds 
1	his few books or his beads or maple dish 
1	or do his gray hairs any violence 
1	but beauty like the fair hesperian tree
1	laden with blooming gold had need the guard
1	of dragon watch with unenchanted eye
1	to save her blossoms and defend her fruit 
1	from the rash hand of bold incontinence 
1	you may as well spread out the unsunned heaps
1	of miser s treasure by an outlaw s den 
1	and tell me it is safe as bid me hope
1	danger will wink on opportunity 
1	and let a single helpless maiden pass
1	uninjured in this wild surrounding waste 
1	of night or loneliness it recks me not 
1	i fear the dread events that dog them both 
1	lest some ill greeting touch attempt the person
1	of our unowned sister 
1	 eld bro i do not brother

1	secure without all doubt or controversy 
1	yet where an equal poise of hope and fear
1	does arbitrate the event my nature is
1	that i incline to hope rather than fear 
1	and gladly banish squint suspicion 
1	my sister is not so defenceless left
1	as you imagine she has a hidden strength 
1	which you remember not 
1	 sec bro what hidden strength 
1	unless the strength of heaven if you mean that 
1	 eld bro i mean that too but yet a hidden strength 
1	which if heaven gave it may be termed her own 
1	 tis chastity my brother chastity 
1	she that has that is clad in complete steel 
1	and like a quivered nymph with arrows keen 
1	may trace huge forests and unharbored heaths 
1	infamous hills and sandy perilous wilds 
1	where through the sacred rays of chastity 
1	no savage fierce bandite or mountaineer 
1	will dare to soil her virgin purity 
1	yea there where very desolation dwells 
1	by grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades 
1	she may pass on with unblenched majesty 
1	be it not done in pride or in presumption 
1	some say no evil thing that walks by night 
1	in fog or fire by lake or moorish fen

1	do ye believe me yet or shall i call
1	antiquity from the old schools of greece
1	to testify the arms of chastity 
1	hence had the huntress dian her dread bow 
1	fair silver shafted queen forever chaste 
1	wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness
1	and spotted mountain pard but set at nought
1	the frivolous bolt of cupid gods and men
1	feared her stern frown and she was queen o the woods 
1	what was that snaky headed gorgon shield
1	that wise minerva wore unconquered virgin 
1	wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone 
1	but rigid looks of chaste austerity 
1	and noble grace that dashed brute violence
1	with sudden adoration and blank awe 
1	so dear to heaven is saintly chastity
1	that when a soul is found sincerely so 
1	a thousand liveried angels lackey her 
1	driving far off each thing of sin and guilt 
1	and in clear dream and solemn vision
1	tell her of things that no gross ear can hear 
1	till oft converse with heavenly habitants
1	begin to cast a beam on the outward shape 
1	the unpolluted temple of the mind 
1	and turns it by degrees to the soul s essence 
1	till all be made immortal but when lust 
1	by unchaste looks loose gestures and foul talk 
1	but most by lewd and lavish act of sin 
1	lets in defilement to the inward parts 
1	the soul grows clotted by contagion 
1	imbodies and imbrutes till she quite lose
1	the divine property of her first being 
1	such are those thick and gloomy shadows damp
1	oft seen in charnel vaults and sepulchres

1	and linked itself by carnal sensualty
1	to a degenerate and degraded state

1	to inveigle and invite the unwary sense

1	this evening late by then the chewing flocks
1	had ta en their supper on the savory herb
1	of knot grass dew besprent and were in fold 
1	i sat me down to watch upon a bank
1	with ivy canopied and interwove
1	with flaunting honeysuckle and began 
1	wrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy 
1	to meditate my rural minstrelsy 
1	till fancy had her fill but ere a close
1	the wonted roar was up amidst the woods 
1	and filled the air with barbarous dissonance 
1	at which i ceased and listened them a while 
1	till an unusual stop of sudden silence
1	gave respite to the drowsy flighted steeds
1	that draw the litter of close curtained sleep 
1	at last a soft and solemn breathing sound
1	rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes 
1	and stole upon the air that even silence
1	was took ere she was ware and wished she might
1	deny her nature and be never more 
1	still to be so displaced i was all ear 
1	and took in strains that might create a soul
1	under the ribs of death but oh ere long
1	too well i did perceive it was the voice
1	of my most honored lady your dear sister 
1	amazed i stood harrowed with grief and fear 
1	and o poor hapless nightingale thought i 
1	 how sweet thou sing st how near the deadly snare 
1	then down the lawns i ran with headlong haste 
1	through paths and turnings often trod by day 
1	till guided by mine ear i found the place
1	where that damned wizard hid in sly disguise
1	 for so by certain signs i knew had met

1	brought to my mind a certain shepherd lad 
1	of small regard to see to yet well skilled
1	in every virtuous plant and healing herb
1	that spreads her verdant leaf to the morning ray 
1	he loved me well and oft would beg me sing 
1	which when i did he on the tender grass
1	would sit and hearken even to ecstasy 
1	and in requital ope his leathern scrip 
1	and show me simples of a thousand names 
1	telling their strange and vigorous faculties 
1	amongst the rest a small unsightly root 
1	but of divine effect he culled me out 
1	the leaf was darkish and had prickles on it 
1	but in another country as he said 
1	bore a bright golden flower but not in this soil 
1	unknown and like esteemed and the dull swain
1	treads on it daily with his clouted shoon 
1	and yet more med cinal is it than that moly
1	that hermes once to wise ulysses gave 
1	he called it haemony and gave it me 
1	and bade me keep it as of sovran use
1	 gainst all enchantments mildew blast or damp 
1	or ghastly furies apparition 
1	i pursed it up but little reckoning made 
1	till now that this extremity compelled 
1	but now i find it true for by this means
1	i knew the foul enchanter though disguised 
1	entered the very lime twigs of his spells 
1	and yet came off if you have this about you
1	 as i will give you when we go you may
1	boldly assault the necromancer s hall 
1	where if he be with dauntless hardihood
1	and brandished blade rush on him break his glass 
1	and shed the luscious liquor on the ground 
1	but seize his wand though he and his curst crew
1	fierce sign of battle make and menace high 
1	or like the sons of vulcan vomit smoke 
1	yet will they soon retire if he but shrink 
1	 eld bro thyrsis lead on apace i ll follow thee 
1	and some good angel bear a shield before us 
1	the scene changes to a stately palace set out with all manner of
1	 comus nay lady sit if i but wave this wand 
1	your nerves are all chained up in alabaster 
1	and you a statue or as daphne was 
1	root bound that fled apollo 
1	 lady fool do not boast 
1	thou canst not touch the freedom of my mind
1	with all thy charms although this corporal rind
1	thou hast immanacled while heaven sees good 
1	 comus why are you vexed lady why do you frown 
1	here dwell no frowns nor anger from these gates
1	sorrow flies far see here be all the pleasures
1	that fancy can beget on youthful thoughts 
1	when the fresh blood grows lively and returns
1	brisk as the april buds in primrose season 
1	and first behold this cordial julep here 
1	that flames and dances in his crystal bounds 
1	with spirits of balm and fragrant syrups mixed 
1	not that nepenthes which the wife of thone
1	is of such power to stir up joy as this 
1	to life so friendly or so cool to thirst 
1	why should you be so cruel to yourself 
1	and to those dainty limbs which nature lent
1	for gentle usage and soft delicacy 
1	but you invert the covenants of her trust 
1	and harshly deal like an ill borrower 
1	with that which you received on other terms 
1	scorning the unexempt condition
1	by which all mortal frailty must subsist 
1	refreshment after toil ease after pain 
1	that have been tired all day without repast 
1	and timely rest have wanted but fair virgin 
1	this will restore all soon 
1	 lady twill not false traitor 
1	 twill not restore the truth and honesty
1	that thou hast banished from thy tongue with lies 
1	was this the cottage and the safe abode
1	thou told st me of what grim aspects are these 
1	these oughly headed monsters mercy guard me 
1	hence with thy brewed enchantments foul deceiver 
1	hast thou betrayed my credulous innocence
1	with vizored falsehood and base forgery 
1	and wouldst thou seek again to trap me here
1	with liquorish baits fit to ensnare a brute 
1	were it a draught for juno when she banquets 
1	i would not taste thy treasonous offer none
1	but such as are good men can give good things 
1	and that which is not good is not delicious
1	to a well governed and wise appetite 
1	 comus o foolishness of men that lend their ears
1	to those budge doctors of the stoic fur 
1	and fetch their precepts from the cynic tub 
1	praising the lean and sallow abstinence 
1	wherefore did nature pour her bounties forth
1	with such a full and unwithdrawing hand 
1	covering the earth with odors fruits and flocks 
1	thronging the seas with spawn innumerable 
1	but all to please and sate the curious taste 
1	and set to work millions of spinning worms 
1	that in their green shops weave the smooth haired silk 
1	to deck her sons and that no corner might
1	be vacant of her plenty in her own loins
1	she hutched the all worshipped ore and precious gems 
1	to store her children with if all the world
1	should in a fit of temperance feed on pulse 
1	drink the clear stream and nothing wear but frieze 
1	the all giver would be unthanked would be unpraised 
1	not half his riches known and yet despised 
1	and we should serve him as a grudging master 
1	who would be quite surcharged with her own weight 
1	and strangled with her waste fertility 
1	the earth cumbered and the winged air darked with plumes 
1	the herds would over multitude their lords 
1	the sea o erfraught would swell and the unsought diamonds
1	would so emblaze the forehead of the deep 
1	and so bestud with stars that they below
1	would grow inured to light and come at last
1	to gaze upon the sun with shameless brows 
1	list lady be not coy and be not cozened
1	with that same vaunted name virginity 
1	beauty is nature s coin must not be hoarded 
1	but must be current and the good thereof
1	consists in mutual and partaken bliss 
1	unsavory in the enjoyment of itself 
1	if you let slip time like a neglected rose
1	it withers on the stalk with languished head 
1	beauty is nature s brag and must be shown
1	in courts at feasts and high solemnities 
1	where most may wonder at the workmanship 
1	it is for homely features to keep home 
1	they had their name thence coarse complexions
1	and cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply
1	the sampler and to tease the huswife s wool 
1	what need a vermeil tinctured lip for that 
1	love darting eyes or tresses like the morn 
1	there was another meaning in these gifts 
1	think what and be advised you are but young yet 
1	 lady i had not thought to have unlocked my lips
1	in this unhallowed air but that this juggler
1	would think to charm my judgment as mine eyes 
1	obtruding false rules pranked in reason s garb 
1	i hate when vice can bolt her arguments
1	and virtue has no tongue to check her pride 
1	impostor do not charge most innocent nature 
1	as if she would her children should be riotous
1	with her abundance she good cateress 
1	means her provision only to the good 
1	that live according to her sober laws 
1	and holy dictate of spare temperance 
1	if every just man that now pines with want
1	had but a moderate and beseeming share
1	of that which lewdly pampered luxury
1	now heaps upon some few with vast excess 
1	nature s full blessings would be well dispensed
1	in unsuperfluous even proportion 
1	and she no whit encumbered with her store 
1	and then the giver would be better thanked 
1	his praise due paid for swinish gluttony
1	ne er looks to heaven amidst his gorgeous feast 
1	but with besotted base ingratitude
1	crams and blasphemes his feeder shall i go on 
1	or have i said enow to him that dares
1	arm his profane tongue with contemptuous words
1	against the sun clad power of chastity
1	fain would i something say yet to what end 
1	thou hast nor ear nor soul to apprehend
1	the sublime notion and high mystery
1	that must be uttered to unfold the sage
1	and serious doctrine of virginity 
1	and thou art worthy that thou shouldst not know
1	more happiness than this thy present lot 
1	enjoy your dear wit and gay rhetoric 
1	that hath so well been taught her dazzling fence 
1	thou art not fit to hear thyself convinced 
1	yet should i try the uncontrolled worth
1	of this pure cause would kindle my rapt spirits
1	to such a flame of sacred vehemence
1	and the brute earth would lend her nerves and shake 
1	till all thy magic structures reared so high 
1	were shattered into heaps o er thy false head 
1	 comus she fables not i feel that i do fear
1	her words set off by some superior power 
1	and though not mortal yet a cold shuddering dew
1	dips me all o er as when the wrath of jove
1	speaks thunder and the chains of erebus
1	to some of saturn s crew i must dissemble 
1	and try her yet more strongly come no more 
1	this is mere moral babble and direct
1	against the canon laws of our foundation 
1	i must not suffer this yet tis but the lees
1	and settlings of a melancholy blood 
1	but this will cure all straight one sip of this
1	will bathe the drooping spirits in delight
1	beyond the bliss of dreams be wise and taste 
1	 spir what have you let the false enchanter scape 
1	o ye mistook ye should have snatched his wand 
1	and bound him fast without his rod reversed 
1	and backward mutters of dissevering power 
1	we cannot free the lady that sits here
1	in stony fetters fixed and motionless 
1	yet stay be not disturbed now i bethink me 
1	some other means i have which may be used 
1	which once of meliboeus old i learnt 
1	the soothest shepherd that e er piped on plains 
1	there is a gentle nymph not far from hence 
1	that with moist curb sways the smooth severn stream 
1	sabrina is her name a virgin pure 
1	whilom she was the daughter of locrine 
1	that had the sceptre from his father brute 
1	she guiltless damsel flying the mad pursuit
1	of her enraged stepdame guendolen 
1	commended her fair innocence to the flood
1	that stayed her flight with his cross flowing course 
1	the water nymphs that in the bottom played 
1	held up their pearled wrists and took her in 
1	bearing her straight to aged nereus hall 
1	who piteous of her woes reared her lank head 
1	and gave her to his daughters to imbathe
1	in nectared lavers strewed with asphodel 
1	and through the porch and inlet of each sense
1	dropt in ambrosial oils till she revived 
1	and underwent a quick immortal change 
1	made goddess of the river still she retains
1	her maiden gentleness and oft at eve
1	visits the herds along the twilight meadows 
1	helping all urchin blasts and ill luck signs
1	that the shrewd meddling elf delights to make 
1	which she with precious vialed liquors heals 
1	for which the shepherds at their festivals 
1	carol her goodness loud in rustic lays 
1	and throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream
1	of pansies pinks and gaudy daffodils 
1	and as the old swain said she can unlock
1	the clasping charm and thaw the numbing spell 
1	if she be right invoked in warbled song 
1	for maidenhood she loves and will be swift
1	to aid a virgin such as was herself 
1	in hard besetting need this will i try 
1	and add the power of some adjuring verse 
1	sabrina fair 
1	listen where thou art sitting
1	under the glassy cool translucent wave 
1	in twisted braids of lilies knitting
1	the loose train of thy amber dropping hair 
1	listen for dear honor s sake 
1	goddess of the silver lake 
1	listen and save 
1	listen and appear to us 
1	in name of great oceanus 
1	by the earth shaking neptune s mace 
1	and tethys grave majestic pace

1	and the carpathian wizard s hook 
1	by scaly triton s winding shell 
1	and old soothsaying glaucus spell

1	and her son that rules the strands 
1	by thetis tinsel slippered feet 
1	and the songs of sirens sweet 
1	by dead parthenope s dear tomb 
1	and fair ligea s golden comb 
1	wherewith she sits on diamond rocks
1	sleeking her soft alluring locks 
1	by all the nymphs that nightly dance
1	upon thy streams with wily glance 
1	rise rise and heave thy rosy head
1	from thy coral paven bed 
1	and bridle in thy headlong wave 
1	till thou our summons answered have 
1	listen and save 
1	sabrina rises attended by water nymphs and sings 
1	by the rushy fringed bank 
1	where grow the willow and the osier dank 
1	my sliding chariot stays 
1	thick set with agate and the azurn sheen
1	of turkis blue and emerald green 
1	that in the channel strays 
1	whilst from off the waters fleet

1	on the lawns and on the leas 
1	this second song presents them to their father and mother 
1	noble lord and lady bright 
1	i have brought ye new delight 
1	here behold so goodly grown
1	three fair branches of your own 
1	heaven hath timely tried their youth 
1	their faith their patience and their truth 
1	and sent them here through hard assays
1	with a crown of deathless praise 
1	to triumph in victorious dance
1	o er sensual folly and intemperance 
1	the dances ended the spirit epiloguizes 
1	 spir to the ocean now i fly 
1	and those happy climes that lie
1	where day never shuts his eye 
1	up in the broad fields of the sky 
1	there i suck the liquid air 
1	all amidst the gardens fair
1	of hesperus and his daughters three
1	that sing about the golden tree 
1	along the crisped shades and bowers
1	revels the spruce and jocund spring 
1	the graces and the rosy bosomed hours
1	thither all their bounties bring 
1	there eternal summer dwells 
1	and west winds with musky wing
1	about the cedarn alleys fling
1	nard and cassia s balmy smells 
1	iris there with humid bow
1	waters the odorous banks that blow
1	flowers of more mingled hue
1	than her purfled scarf can shew 
1	and drenches with elysian dew
1	 list mortals if your ears be true 
1	beds of hyacinth and roses 
1	where young adonis oft reposes 
1	waxing well of his deep wound 
1	in slumbers soft and on the ground
1	sadly sits the assyrian queen 
1	but far above in spangled sheen 
1	celestial cupid her famed son advanced
1	holds his dear psyche sweet entranced
1	after her wandering labors long 
1	till free consent the gods among
1	make her his eternal bride 
1	and from her fair unspotted side
1	two blissful twins are to be born 
1	youth and joy so jove hath sworn 
1	but now my task is smoothly done 
1	i can fly or i can run
1	quickly to the green earth s end 
1	where the bowed welkin slow doth bend 
1	and from thence can soar as soon
1	to the corners of the moon 
1	mortals that would follow me 
1	love virtue she alone is free 
1	she can teach ye how to climb
1	higher than the sphery chime 
1	or if virtue feeble were 
1	heaven itself would stoop to her 
1	yet once more o ye laurels and once more 
1	ye myrtles brown with ivy never sere 
1	i come to pluck your berries harsh and crude 
1	and with forced fingers rude
1	shatter your leaves before the mellowing year 
1	bitter constraint and sad occasion dear
1	compels me to disturb your season due 
1	for lycidas is dead dead ere his prime 
1	young lycidas and hath not left his peer 
1	who would not sing for lycidas he knew
1	himself to sing and build the lofty rhyme 
1	he must not float upon his watery bier
1	unwept and welter to the parching wind 
1	without the meed of some melodious tear 
1	begin then sisters of the sacred well
1	that from beneath the seat of jove doth spring 
1	begin and somewhat loudly sweep the string 
1	hence with denial vain and coy excuse 
1	so may some gentle muse
1	with lucky words favor my destined urn 
1	and as he passes turn 
1	and bid fair peace be to my sable shroud 
1	for we were nursed upon the self same hill 
1	fed the same flock by fountain shade and rill 
1	together both ere the high lawns appeared
1	under the opening eyelids of the morn 
1	we drove a field and both together heard
1	what time the gray fly winds her sultry horn 
1	battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night 
1	oft till the star that rose at evening bright
1	toward heaven s descent had sloped his westering wheel 
1	meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute 
1	tempered to the oaten flute
1	rough satyrs danced and fauns with cloven heel
1	from the glad sound would not be absent long 
1	and old damoetas loved to hear our song 
1	but oh the heavy change now thou art gone 
1	now thou art gone and never must return 
1	thee shepherd thee the woods and desert caves 
1	with wild thyme and the gadding vine o ergrown 
1	and all their echoes mourn 
1	the willows and the hazel copses green 
1	shall now no more be seen
1	fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays 
1	as killing as the canker to the rose 
1	or taint worm to the weanling herds that graze 
1	or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear 
1	when first the white thorn blows 
1	such lycidas thy loss to shepherd s ear 
1	where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep
1	closed o er the head of your loved lycidas 
1	for neither were ye playing on the steep
1	where your old bards the famous druids lie 
1	nor on the shaggy top of mona high 
1	nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream 
1	ay me i fondly dream
1	 had ye been there for what could that have done 
1	what could the muse herself that orpheus bore 
1	the muse herself for her enchanting son 
1	whom universal nature did lament 
1	when by the rout that made the hideous roar 
1	his gory visage down the stream was sent 
1	down the swift hebrus to the lesbian shore 
1	alas what boots it with uncessant care
1	to tend the homely slighted shepherd s trade 
1	and strictly meditate the thankless muse 
1	were it not better done as others use 
1	to sport with amaryllis in the shade 
1	or with the tangles of neaera s hair 
1	fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise
1	 that last infirmity of noble mind 
1	to scorn delights and live laborious days 
1	but the fair guerdon when we hope to find 
1	and think to burst out into sudden blaze 
1	comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears 
1	and slits the thin spun life but not the praise 
1	phoebus replied and touched my trembling ears 
1	 fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil 
1	nor in the glistering foil
1	set off to the world nor in broad rumor lies 
1	but lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes
1	and perfect witness of all judging jove 
1	as he pronounces lastly on each deed 
1	of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed 
1	o fountain arethuse and thou honored flood 
1	smooth sliding mincius crowned with vocal reeds 
1	that strain i heard was of a higher mood 
1	but now my oat proceeds 
1	and listens to the herald of the sea 
1	that came in neptune s plea 
1	he asked the waves and asked the felon winds 
1	what hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain 
1	and questioned every gust of rugged wings
1	that blows from off each beaked promontory 
1	they knew not of his story 
1	and sage hippotades their answer brings 
1	that not a blast was from his dungeon strayed 
1	the air was calm and on the level brine
1	sleek panope with all her sisters played 
1	it was that fatal and perfidious bark 
1	built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark 
1	that sunk so low that sacred head of thine 
1	next camus reverend sire went footing slow 
1	his mantle hairy and his bonnet sedge 
1	inwrought with figures dim and on the edge
1	like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe 
1	 ah who hath reft quoth he my dearest pledge 
1	last came and last did go 
1	two massy keys he bore of metals twain
1	 the golden opes the iron shuts amain 
1	he shook his mitred locks and stern bespake 
1	 how well could i have spared for thee young swain 
1	enow of such as for their bellies sake 
1	creep and intrude and climb into the fold 
1	of other care they little reckoning make
1	than how to scramble at the shearers feast 
1	and shove away the worthy bidden guest 
1	blind mouths that scarce themselves know how to hold
1	a sheep hook or have learnt aught else the least
1	that to the faithful herdman s art belongs 
1	what recks it them what need they they are sped 
1	and when they list their lean and flashy songs
1	grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw 
1	the hungry sheep look up and are not fed 
1	but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw 
1	rot inwardly and foul contagion spread 
1	besides what the grim wolf with privy paw
1	daily devours apace and nothing said 
1	but that two handed engine at the door
1	stands ready to smite once and smite no more 
1	return alpheus the dread voice is past
1	that shrunk thy streams return sicilian muse 
1	and call the vales and bid them hither cast
1	their bells and flowerets of a thousand hues 
1	ye valleys low where the mild whispers use
1	of shades and wanton winds and gushing brooks 
1	on whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks 
1	throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes 
1	that on the green turf suck the honeyed showers 
1	and purple all the ground with vernal flowers 
1	bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies 
1	the tufted crow toe and pale jessamine 
1	the white pink and the pansy freaked with jet 
1	the glowing violet 
1	the musk rose and the well attired woodbine 
1	with cowslips wan that hang the pensive head 
1	and every flower that sad embroidery wears 
1	bid amaranthus all his beauty shed 
1	and daffadillies fill their cups with tears 
1	to strew the laureate hearse where lycid lies 
1	for so to interpose a little ease 
1	let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise 
1	ay me whilst thee the shores and sounding seas
1	wash far away where er thy bones are hurled 
1	whether beyond the stormy hebrides 
1	where thou perhaps under the whelming tide
1	visit st the bottom of the monstrous world 
1	or whether thou to our moist vows denied 
1	sleep st by the fable of bellerus old 
1	where the great vision of the guarded mount
1	looks toward namancos and bayona s hold 
1	look homeward angel now and melt with ruth 
1	and o ye dolphins waft the hapless youth 
1	weep no more woeful shepherds weep no more 
1	for lycidas your sorrow is not dead 
1	sunk though he be beneath the watery floor 
1	so sinks the day star in the ocean bed 
1	and yet anon repairs his drooping head 
1	and tricks his beams and with new spangled ore
1	flames in the forehead of the morning sky 
1	so lycidas sunk low but mounted high 
1	through the dear might of him that walked the waves 
1	where other groves and other streams along 
1	with nectar pure his oozy locks he laves 
1	and hears the unexpressive nuptial song 
1	in the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love 
1	there entertain him all the saints above 
1	in solemn troops and sweet societies 
1	that sing and singing in their glory move 
1	and wipe the tears forever from his eyes 
1	now lycidas the shepherds weep no more 
1	henceforth thou art the genius of the shore 
1	in thy large recompense and shalt be good
1	to all that wander in that perilous flood

1	on this side nothing and by proof we feel

1	the better reason to perplex and dash

1	in what he counsels and in what excels
1	mistrustful grounds his courage on despair

1	with armed watch that render all access
1	impregnable oft on the bordering deep
1	encamp thir legions or with obscure wing

1	scorning surprize or could we break our way

1	with blackest insurrection to confound
1	heav ns purest light yet our great enemie
1	all incorruptible would on his throne
1	sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould
1	incapable of stain would soon expel

1	victorious thus repuls d our final hope

1	th almighty victor to spend all his rage 
1	and that must end us that must be our cure 
1	to be no more sad cure for who would loose 
1	though full of pain this intellectual being 
1	those thoughts that wander through eternity 
1	to perish rather swallowd up and lost
1	in the wide womb of uncreated night 
1	devoid of sense and motion and who knows 
1	let this be good whether our angry foe
1	can give it or will ever how he can
1	is doubtful that he never will is sure 
1	will he so wise let loose at once his ire 
1	belike through impotence or unaware 
1	to give his enemies thir wish and end
1	them in his anger whom his anger saves
1	to punish endless wherefore cease we then

1	reserv d and destin d to eternal woe 
1	whatever doing what can we suffer more 
1	what can we suffer worse is this then worst 
1	thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms 
1	what when we fled amain pursu d and strook
1	with heav ns afflicting thunder and besought
1	the deep to shelter us this hell then seem d
1	a refuge from those wounds or when we lay

1	and plunge us in the flames or from above
1	should intermitted vengeance arme again

1	thus trampl d thus expell d to suffer here
1	chains these torments better these then worse
1	by my advice since fate inevitable
1	the victors will to suffer as to doe 
1	our strength is equal nor the law unjust
1	that so ordains this was at first resolv d 
1	if we were wise against so great a foe
1	contending and so doubtful what might fall

1	and vent rous if that fail them shrink and fear
1	what yet they know must follow to endure
1	exile or ignominy or bonds or pain 
1	the sentence of thir conquerour this is now
1	our doom which if we can sustain and bear 
1	our supream foe in time may much remit
1	his anger and perhaps thus farr remov d
1	not mind us not offending satisfi d
1	with what is punish t whence these raging fires
1	will slack n if his breath stir not thir flames 
1	our purer essence then will overcome
1	thir noxious vapour or enur d not feel

1	this horror will grow milde this darkness light 
1	besides what hope the never ending flight
1	of future days may bring what chance what change
1	worth waiting since our present lot appeers
1	for happy though but ill for ill not worst 
1	if we procure not to our selves more woe 
1	thus belial with words cloath d in reasons garb

1	not peace and after him thus mammon spake

1	we warr if warr be best or to regain
1	our own right lost him to unthrone we then
1	may hope when everlasting fate shall yeild
1	to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife 
1	the former vain to hope argues as vain
1	the latter for what place can be for us
1	within heav ns bound unless heav ns lord supream
1	we overpower suppose he should relent
1	and publish grace to all on promise made
1	of new subjection with what eyes could we

1	unacceptable though in heav n our state

1	hard liberty before the easie yoke
1	of servile pomp our greatness will appear
1	then most conspicuous when great things of small 
1	useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse
1	we can create and in what place so e re
1	thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
1	through labour and endurance this deep world
1	of darkness do we dread how oft amidst

1	choose to reside his glory unobscur d

1	in doing what we most in suffering feel

1	with dangerous expedition to invade

1	secure and at the brightning orient beam
1	purge off this gloom the soft delicious air

1	without dimension where length breadth and highth 
1	and time and place are lost where eldest night
1	and chaos ancestors of nature hold

1	uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league

1	of this frail world by which the spirits perverse
1	with easie intercourse pass to and fro
1	to tempt or punish mortals except whom
1	god and good angels guard by special grace 
1	but now at last the sacred influence
1	of light appears and from the walls of heav n
1	shoots farr into the bosom of dim night
1	a glimmering dawn here nature first begins
1	her fardest verge and chaos to retire
1	as from her outmost works a brok n foe
1	with tumult less and with less hostile din 
1	that satan with less toil and now with ease
1	wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light

1	though distant farr som small reflection gaines
1	of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud 
1	here walk d the fiend at large in spacious field 
1	as when a vultur on imaus bred 
1	whose snowie ridge the roving tartar bounds 
1	dislodging from a region scarce of prey
1	to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids
1	on hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
1	but in his way lights on the barren plaines
1	with sails and wind thir canie waggons light 
1	so on this windie sea of land the fiend
1	walk d up and down alone bent on his prey 
1	alone for other creature in this place
1	living or liveless to be found was none 
1	none yet but store hereafter from the earth
1	up hither like aereal vapours flew

1	built thir fond hopes of glorie or lasting fame 
1	or happiness in this or th other life

1	abortive monstrous or unkindly mixt 
1	dissolvd on earth fleet hither and in vain 
1	till final dissolution wander here 
1	not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamd 
1	those argent fields more likely habitants 
1	translated saints or middle spirits hold
1	betwixt th angelical and human kinde 
1	hither of ill joynd sons and daughters born
1	first from the ancient world those giants came
1	with many a vain exploit though then renownd

1	in golgotha him dead who lives in heav n 
1	and they who to be sure of paradise
1	dying put on the weeds of dominic 
1	or in franciscan think to pass disguis d 
1	they pass the planets seven and pass the fixt 
1	and that crystalline sphear whose ballance weighs
1	the trepidation talkt and that first mov d 
1	and now saint peter at heav ns wicket seems
1	to wait them with his keys and now at foot
1	of heav ns ascent they lift thir feet when loe
1	a violent cross wind from either coast
1	blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
1	into the devious air then might ye see
1	cowles hoods and habits with thir wearers tost
1	and flutterd into raggs then reliques beads 
1	the sport of winds all these upwhirld aloft
1	fly o re the backside of the world farr off
1	into a limbo large and broad since calld
1	the paradise of fools to few unknown
1	long after now unpeopl d and untrod

1	and long he wanderd till at last a gleame
1	of dawning light turnd thither ward in haste
1	his travell d steps farr distant hee descries
1	ascending by degrees magnificent
1	up to the wall of heaven a structure high 
1	at top whereof but farr more rich appeerd
1	the work as of a kingly palace gate
1	imbellisht thick with sparkling orient gemmes
1	the portal shon inimitable on earth
1	by model or by shading pencil drawn 
1	the stairs were such as whereon jacob saw
1	angels ascending and descending bands
1	of guardians bright when he from esau fled
1	to padan aram in the field of luz 
1	dreaming by night under the open skie 
1	and waking cri d this is the gate of heav n 
1	each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
1	there alwaies but drawn up to heav n somtimes
1	viewless and underneath a bright sea flow d
1	of jasper or of liquid pearle whereon
1	who after came from earth sayling arriv d 
1	wafted by angels or flew o re the lake
1	rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds 
1	the stairs were then let down whether to dare
1	the fiend by easie ascent or aggravate
1	his sad exclusion from the dores of bliss 
1	direct against which op nd from beneath 
1	just o re the blissful seat of paradise 
1	a passage down to th earth a passage wide 
1	wider by farr then that of after times
1	over mount sion and though that were large 
1	over the promis d land to god so dear 
1	by which to visit oft those happy tribes 
1	on high behests his angels to and fro
1	pass d frequent and his eye with choice regard
1	from paneas the fount of jordans flood
1	so wide the op ning seemd where bounds were set
1	to darkness such as bound the ocean wave 
1	satan from hence now on the lower stair
1	that scal d by steps of gold to heav n gate
1	looks down with wonder at the sudden view
1	of all this world at once as when a scout
1	through dark and desart wayes with peril gone
1	all night at last by break of chearful dawne
1	obtains the brow of some high climbing hill 
1	which to his eye discovers unaware
1	the goodly prospect of some forein land
1	first seen or some renownd metropolis
1	with glistering spires and pinnacles adornd 
1	which now the rising sun guilds with his beams 
1	such wonder seis d though after heaven seen 
1	the spirit maligne but much more envy seis d
1	at sight of all this world beheld so faire 
1	round he surveys and well might where he stood
1	so high above the circling canopie
1	of nights extended shade from eastern point
1	of libra to the fleecie starr that bears
1	beyond th horizon then from pole to pole
1	he views in bredth and without longer pause
1	down right into the worlds first region throws
1	his flight precipitant and windes with ease
1	through the pure marble air his oblique way
1	amongst innumerable starrs that shon
1	stars distant but nigh hand seemd other worlds 
1	or other worlds they seemd or happy iles 
1	like those hesperian gardens fam d of old 
1	fortunate fields and groves and flourie vales 
1	thrice happy iles but who dwelt happy there
1	he stayd not to enquire above them all
1	the golden sun in splendor likest heaven
1	allur d his eye thither his course he bends
1	through the calm firmament but up or downe
1	by center or eccentric hard to tell 
1	or longitude where the great luminarie
1	alooff the vulgar constellations thick 
1	that from his lordly eye keep distance due 
1	dispenses light from farr they as they move
1	thir starry dance in numbers that compute
1	days months and years towards his all chearing lamp
1	turn swift their various motions or are turnd
1	by his magnetic beam that gently warms
1	the univers and to each inward part
1	with gentle penetration though unseen 
1	shoots invisible vertue even to the deep 
1	so wondrously was set his station bright 
1	there lands the fiend a spot like which perhaps
1	astronomer in the sun s lucent orbe
1	through his glaz d optic tube yet never saw 
1	the place he found beyond expression bright 
1	compar d with aught on earth medal or stone 
1	not all parts like but all alike informd
1	with radiant light as glowing iron with fire 
1	if mettal part seemd gold part silver cleer 
1	if stone carbuncle most or chrysolite 
1	rubie or topaz to the twelve that shon
1	in aarons brest plate and a stone besides
1	imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen 
1	that stone or like to that which here below
1	philosophers in vain so long have sought 
1	in vain though by thir powerful art they binde
1	volatil hermes and call up unbound
1	in various shapes old proteus from the sea 
1	draind through a limbec to his native forme 
1	what wonder then if fields and regions here
1	breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run
1	potable gold when with one vertuous touch
1	th arch chimic sun so farr from us remote
1	produces with terrestrial humor mixt
1	here in the dark so many precious things
1	of colour glorious and effect so rare 
1	here matter new to gaze the devil met
1	undazl d farr and wide his eye commands 
1	for sight no obstacle found here nor shade 
1	but all sun shine as when his beams at noon
1	culminate from th aequator as they now
1	shot upward still direct whence no way round
1	shadow from body opaque can fall and the aire 
1	no where so cleer sharp nd his visual ray
1	to objects distant farr whereby he soon
1	saw within kenn a glorious angel stand 
1	the same whom john saw also in the sun 
1	his back was turnd but not his brightness hid 
1	of beaming sunnie raies a golden tiar
1	circl d his head nor less his locks behind
1	illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
1	lay waving round on som great charge imploy d
1	hee seemd or fixt in cogitation deep 
1	glad was the spirit impure as now in hope
1	to find who might direct his wandring flight
1	to paradise the happie seat of man 
1	his journies end and our beginning woe 
1	but first he casts to change his proper shape 
1	which else might work him danger or delay 
1	and now a stripling cherube he appeers 
1	not of the prime yet such as in his face
1	youth smil d celestial and to every limb
1	sutable grace diffus d so well he feignd 
1	under a coronet his flowing haire
1	in curles on either cheek plaid wings he wore
1	of many a colourd plume sprinkl d with gold 
1	his habit fit for speed succinct and held
1	before his decent steps a silver wand 
1	he drew not nigh unheard the angel bright 
1	ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turnd 
1	admonisht by his eare and strait was known
1	th arch angel uriel one of the seav n
1	who in gods presence neerest to his throne

1	who justly hath drivn out his rebell foes
1	to deepest hell and to repair that loss
1	created this new happie race of men
1	to serve him better wise are all his wayes 
1	so spake the false dissembler unperceivd 
1	for neither man nor angel can discern
1	hypocrisie the only evil that walks
1	invisible except to god alone 
1	by his permissive will through heav n and earth 
1	and oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps
1	at wisdoms gate and to simplicitie
1	resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill

1	where honour due and reverence none neglects 
1	took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath 
1	down from th ecliptic sped with hop d success 
1	throws his steep flight with many an aerie wheele

1	then when the dragon put to second rout 
1	came furious down to be reveng d on men 
1	while time was our first parents had bin warnd

1	far off and fearless nor with cause to boast 
1	begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth

1	one step no more then from himself can fly
1	by change of place now conscience wakes despair

1	of what he was what is and what must be
1	worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue 
1	sometimes towards eden which now in his view

1	o sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams
1	that bring to my remembrance from what state
1	i fell how glorious once above thy spheare 
1	till pride and worse ambition threw me down
1	warring in heav n against heav ns matchless king 
1	ah wherefore he deservd no such return
1	from me whom he created what i was
1	in that bright eminence and with his good
1	upbraided none nor was his service hard 
1	what could be less then to afford him praise 
1	the easiest recompence and pay him thanks 
1	how due yet all his good prov d ill in me 
1	and wrought but malice lifted up so high
1	i sdeind subjection and thought one step higher
1	would set me highest and in a moment quit
1	the debt immense of endless gratitude 
1	so burthensome still paying still to ow 
1	forgetful what from him i still receivd 
1	and understood not that a grateful mind
1	by owing owes not but still pays at once
1	indebted and dischargd what burden then 
1	o had his powerful destiny ordaind
1	me some inferiour angel i had stood
1	then happie no unbounded hope had rais d
1	ambition yet why not som other power
1	as great might have aspir d and me though mean
1	drawn to his part but other powers as great
1	fell not but stand unshak n from within
1	or from without to all temptations arm d 
1	hadst thou the same free will and power to stand 
1	thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse 
1	but heav ns free love dealt equally to all 
1	be then his love accurst since love or hate 
1	to me alike it deals eternal woe 
1	nay curs d be thou since against his thy will
1	chose freely what it now so justly rues 
1	me miserable which way shall i flie
1	infinite wrauth and infinite despaire 
1	which way i flie is hell my self am hell 
1	and in the lowest deep a lower deep
1	still threatning to devour me opens wide 
1	to which the hell i suffer seems a heav n 
1	o then at last relent is there no place
1	left for repentance none for pardon left 
1	none left but by submission and that word
1	disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
1	among the spirits beneath whom i seduc d
1	with other promises and other vaunts
1	then to submit boasting i could subdue
1	th omnipotent ay me they little know
1	how dearly i abide that boast so vaine 
1	under what torments inwardly i groane 
1	while they adore me on the throne of hell 
1	with diadem and scepter high advanc d
1	the lower still i fall onely supream
1	in miserie such joy ambition findes 
1	but say i could repent and could obtaine
1	by act of grace my former state how soon
1	would highth recal high thoughts how soon unsay
1	what feign d submission swore ease would recant
1	vows made in pain as violent and void 
1	for never can true reconcilement grow
1	where wounds of deadly hate have peirc d so deep 
1	which would but lead me to a worse relapse
1	and heavier fall so should i purchase deare
1	short intermission bought with double smart 
1	this knows my punisher therefore as farr
1	from granting hee as i from begging peace 
1	all hope excluded thus behold in stead
1	of us out cast exil d his new delight 
1	mankind created and for him this world 
1	so farwel hope and with hope farwel fear 
1	farwel remorse all good to me is lost 
1	evil be thou my good by thee at least
1	divided empire with heav ns king i hold
1	by thee and more then half perhaps will reigne 
1	as man ere long and this new world shall know 
1	thus while he spake each passion dimm d his face
1	thrice chang d with pale ire envie and despair 
1	which marrd his borrow d visage and betraid
1	him counterfet if any eye beheld 
1	for heav nly mindes from such distempers foule

1	each perturbation smooth d with outward calme 
1	artificer of fraud and was the first
1	that practisd falshood under saintly shew 
1	deep malice to conceale couch t with revenge 
1	yet not anough had practisd to deceive
1	uriel once warnd whose eye pursu d him down

1	saw him disfigur d more then could befall
1	spirit of happie sort his gestures fierce
1	he markd and mad demeanour then alone 
1	as he suppos d all unobserv d unseen 
1	so on he fares and to the border comes
1	of eden where delicious paradise 
1	now nearer crowns with her enclosure green 
1	as with a rural mound the champain head
1	of a steep wilderness whose hairie sides
1	with thicket overgrown grottesque and wilde 
1	access deni d and over head up grew
1	insuperable highth of loftiest shade 
1	cedar and pine and firr and branching palm 
1	a silvan scene and as the ranks ascend
1	shade above shade a woodie theatre
1	of stateliest view yet higher then thir tops
1	the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung 
1	which to our general sire gave prospect large
1	into his neather empire neighbouring round 
1	and higher then that wall a circling row
1	of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit 
1	blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue
1	appeerd with gay enameld colours mixt 
1	on which the sun more glad impress d his beams
1	then in fair evening cloud or humid bow 
1	when god hath showrd the earth so lovely seemd
1	that lantskip and of pure now purer aire
1	meets his approach and to the heart inspires
1	vernal delight and joy able to drive
1	all sadness but despair now gentle gales
1	fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense
1	native perfumes and whisper whence they stole
1	those balmie spoiles as when to them who saile
1	beyond the cape of hope and now are past
1	mozambic off at sea north east windes blow
1	sabean odours from the spicie shoare
1	of arabie the blest with such delay
1	well pleas d they slack thir course and many a league
1	cheard with the grateful smell old ocean smiles 
1	so entertaind those odorous sweets the fiend
1	who came thir bane though with them better pleas d
1	then asmodeus with the fishie fume 
1	that drove him though enamourd from the spouse
1	of tobits son and with a vengeance sent
1	now to th ascent of that steep savage hill
1	satan had journied on pensive and slow 
1	but further way found none so thick entwin d 
1	as one continu d brake the undergrowth
1	of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext
1	all path of man or beast that past that way 
1	one gate there onely was and that look d east
1	on th other side which when th arch fellon saw
1	due entrance he disdaind and in contempt 
1	at one slight bound high overleap d all bound
1	of hill or highest wall and sheer within
1	lights on his feet as when a prowling wolfe 
1	whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey 
1	watching where shepherds pen thir flocks at eeve
1	in hurdl d cotes amid the field secure 
1	leaps o re the fence with ease into the fould 
1	or as a thief bent to unhoord the cash
1	of some rich burgher whose substantial dores 
1	cross barrd and bolted fast fear no assault 
1	in at the window climbes or o re the tiles 
1	so clomb this first grand thief into gods fould 
1	so since into his church lewd hirelings climbe 
1	thence up he flew and on the tree of life 
1	the middle tree and highest there that grew 
1	sat like a cormorant yet not true life
1	thereby regaind but sat devising death
1	to them who liv d nor on the vertue thought

1	for prospect what well us d had bin the pledge
1	of immortalitie so little knows

1	to worst abuse or to thir meanest use 
1	beneath him with new wonder now he views
1	to all delight of human sense expos d
1	in narrow room natures whole wealth yea more 
1	a heaven on earth for blissful paradise
1	of god the garden was by him in the east
1	of eden planted eden stretchd her line
1	from auran eastward to the royal towrs
1	of great seleucia built by grecian kings 
1	or where the sons of eden long before

1	out of the fertil ground he caus d to grow

1	upon the rapid current which through veins
1	of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn 
1	rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
1	waterd the garden thence united fell
1	down the steep glade and met the neather flood 
1	which from his darksom passage now appeers 
1	and now divided into four main streams 
1	runs divers wandring many a famous realme
1	and country whereof here needs no account 
1	but rather to tell how if art could tell 
1	how from that saphire fount the crisped brooks 
1	rowling on orient pearl and sands of gold 
1	with mazie error under pendant shades

1	powrd forth profuse on hill and dale and plaine

1	more woe the more your taste is now of joy

1	henceforth my dwelling haply may not please
1	like this fair paradise your sense yet such
1	accept your makers work he gave it me

1	the only sign of our obedience left
1	among so many signes of power and rule

1	and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy
1	so farr the happier lot enjoying thee
1	preeminent by so much odds while thou
1	like consort to thy self canst no where find 
1	that day i oft remember when from sleep
1	i first awak t and found my self repos d
1	under a shade on flours much wondring where
1	and what i was whence thither brought and how 
1	not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
1	of waters issu d from a cave and spread
1	into a liquid plain then stood unmov d
1	pure as th expanse of heav n i thither went
1	with unexperienc t thought and laid me downe
1	on the green bank to look into the cleer
1	smooth lake that to me seemd another skie 
1	as i bent down to look just opposite 
1	a shape within the watry gleam appeerd
1	bending to look on me i started back 
1	it started back but pleasd i soon returnd 
1	pleas d it returnd as soon with answering looks
1	of sympathie and love there i had fixt
1	mine eyes till now and pin d with vain desire 
1	had not a voice thus warnd me what thou seest 
1	what there thou seest fair creature is thy self 
1	with thee it came and goes but follow me 
1	and i will bring thee where no shadow staies
1	thy coming and thy soft imbraces hee
1	whose image thou art him thou shall enjoy
1	inseparablie thine to him shalt beare
1	multitudes like thy self and thence be call d
1	mother of human race what could i doe 
1	but follow strait invisibly thus led 
1	till i espi d thee fair indeed and tall 
1	under a platan yet methought less faire 
1	less winning soft less amiablie milde 
1	then that smooth watry image back i turnd 
1	thou following cryd st aloud return fair eve 
1	whom fli st thou whom thou fli st of him thou art

1	out of my side to thee neerest my heart
1	substantial life to have thee by my side
1	henceforth an individual solace dear

1	my other half with that thy gentle hand
1	seisd mine i yeilded and from that time see
1	how beauty is excelld by manly grace
1	and wisdom which alone is truly fair 
1	so spake our general mother and with eyes
1	of conjugal attraction unreprov d 
1	and meek surrender half imbracing leand
1	on our first father half her swelling breast
1	naked met his under the flowing gold
1	of her loose tresses hid he in delight
1	both of her beauty and submissive charms
1	smil d with superior love as jupiter
1	on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
1	that shed may flowers and press d her matron lip
1	with kisses pure aside the devil turnd
1	for envie yet with jealous leer maligne
1	ey d them askance and to himself thus plaind

1	the happier eden shall enjoy thir fill
1	of bliss on bliss while i to hell am thrust

1	among our other torments not the least 
1	still unfulfill d with pain of longing pines 
1	yet let me not forget what i have gain d
1	from thir own mouths all is not theirs it seems 
1	one fatal tree there stands of knowledge call d 
1	forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidd n 
1	suspicious reasonless why should thir lord
1	envie them that can it be sin to know 
1	can it be death and do they onely stand
1	by ignorance is that thir happie state 
1	the proof of thir obedience and thir faith 
1	o fair foundation laid whereon to build
1	thir ruine hence i will excite thir minds
1	with more desire to know and to reject
1	envious commands invented with designe
1	to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
1	equal with gods aspiring to be such 
1	they taste and die what likelier can ensue 
1	but first with narrow search i must walk round
1	this garden and no corner leave unspi d 
1	a chance but chance may lead where i may meet
1	some wandring spirit of heav n by fountain side 
1	or in thick shade retir d from him to draw
1	what further would be learnt live while ye may 
1	yet happie pair enjoy till i return 
1	short pleasures for long woes are to succeed 
1	so saying his proud step he scornful turn d 
1	but with sly circumspection and began
1	through wood through waste o re hil o re dale his roam 
1	mean while in utmost longitude where heav n
1	with earth and ocean meets the setting sun
1	slowly descended and with right aspect
1	against the eastern gate of paradise
1	leveld his eevning rayes it was a rock
1	of alablaster pil d up to the clouds 
1	conspicuous farr winding with one ascent
1	accessible from earth one entrance high 
1	the rest was craggie cliff that overhung
1	still as it rose impossible to climbe 
1	betwixt these rockie pillars gabriel sat
1	chief of th angelic guards awaiting night 
1	about him exercis d heroic games
1	th unarmed youth of heav n but nigh at hand
1	hung high with diamond flaming and with gold 
1	thither came uriel gliding through the eeven
1	on a sun beam swift as a shooting starr
1	in autumn thwarts the night when vapors fir d

1	from what point of his compass to beware
1	impetuous winds he thus began in haste 
1	gabriel to thee thy cours by lot hath giv n
1	charge and strict watch that to this happie place
1	no evil thing approach or enter in 
1	this day at highth of noon came to my spheare
1	a spirit zealous as he seem d to know
1	more of th almighties works and chiefly man
1	gods latest image i describ d his way
1	bent all on speed and markt his aerie gate 
1	but in the mount that lies from eden north 
1	where he first lighted soon discernd his looks
1	alien from heav n with passions foul obscur d 
1	mine eye pursu d him still but under shade
1	lost sight of him one of the banisht crew
1	i fear hath ventur d from the deep to raise
1	new troubles him thy care must be to find

1	no creature thence if spirit of other sort 
1	so minded have oreleapt these earthie bounds
1	on purpose hard thou knowst it to exclude

1	returnd on that bright beam whose point now raisd

1	incredible how swift had thither rowl d
1	diurnal or this less volubil earth
1	by shorter flight to th east had left him there
1	arraying with reflected purple and gold
1	the clouds that on his western throne attend 
1	now came still eevning on and twilight gray
1	had in her sober liverie all things clad 
1	silence accompanied for beast and bird 
1	they to thir grassie couch these to thir nests

1	our circuit meets full west as flame they part
1	half wheeling to the shield half to the spear 
1	from these two strong and suttle spirits he calld

1	ithuriel and zephon with wingd speed
1	search through this garden leav unsearcht no nook

1	who tells of som infernal spirit seen
1	hitherward bent who could have thought escap d
1	the barrs of hell on errand bad no doubt 
1	such where ye find seise fast and hither bring 
1	so saying on he led his radiant files 
1	daz ling the moon these to the bower direct
1	in search of whom they sought him there they found
1	squat like a toad close at the eare of eve 
1	assaying by his devilish art to reach
1	the organs of her fancie and with them forge
1	illusions as he list phantasms and dreams 
1	or if inspiring venom he might taint
1	th animal spirits that from pure blood arise
1	like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
1	at least distemperd discontented thoughts 
1	vain hopes vain aimes inordinate desires
1	blown up with high conceits ingendring pride 
1	him thus intent ithuriel with his spear
1	touch d lightly for no falshood can endure
1	touch of celestial temper but returns
1	of force to its own likeness up he starts
1	discoverd and surpriz d as when a spark
1	lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
1	fit for the tun som magazin to store
1	against a rumord warr the smuttie graine
1	with sudden blaze diffus d inflames the aire 
1	so started up in his own shape the fiend 
1	back stept those two fair angels half amaz d
1	so sudden to behold the grieslie king 
1	yet thus unmovd with fear accost him soon 
1	which of those rebell spirits adjudg d to hell
1	com st thou escap d thy prison and transform d 
1	why satst thou like an enemie in waite
1	here watching at the head of these that sleep 
1	know ye not then said satan filld with scorn 
1	know ye not me ye knew me once no mate
1	for you there sitting where ye durst not soare 
1	not to know mee argues your selves unknown 
1	the lowest of your throng or if ye know 
1	why ask ye and superfluous begin
1	your message like to end as much in vain 
1	to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn 
1	think not revolted spirit thy shape the same 
1	or undiminisht brightness to be known
1	as when thou stoodst in heav n upright and pure 
1	that glorie then when thou no more wast good 
1	departed from thee and thou resembl st now
1	thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule 
1	but come for thou be sure shalt give account
1	to him who sent us whose charge is to keep
1	this place inviolable and these from harm 
1	so spake the cherube and his grave rebuke
1	severe in youthful beautie added grace
1	invincible abasht the devil stood 
1	and felt how awful goodness is and saw
1	vertue in her shape how lovly saw and pin d
1	his loss but chiefly to find here observd
1	his lustre visibly impar d yet seemd
1	undaunted if i must contend said he 
1	best with the best the sender not the sent 
1	or all at once more glorie will be wonn 
1	or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold 
1	will save us trial what the least can doe
1	single against thee wicked and thence weak 
1	the fiend repli d not overcome with rage 
1	but like a proud steed reind went hautie on 
1	chaumping his iron curb to strive or flie
1	he held it vain awe from above had quelld
1	his heart not else dismai d now drew they nigh
1	the western point where those half rounding guards
1	just met closing stood in squadron joind
1	awaiting next command to whom thir chief
1	gabriel from the front thus calld aloud 
1	o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet
1	hasting this way and now by glimps discerne
1	ithuriel and zephon through the shade 
1	and with them comes a third of regal port 
1	but faded splendor wan who by his gate
1	and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell 
1	not likely to part hence without contest 
1	stand firm for in his look defiance lours 
1	he scarce had ended when those two approachd
1	and brief related whom they brought wher found 
1	how busied in what form and posture coucht 
1	to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake 
1	why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescrib d
1	to thy transgressions and disturbd the charge
1	of others who approve not to transgress
1	by thy example but have power and right
1	to question thy bold entrance on this place 
1	imploi d it seems to violate sleep and those
1	whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss 
1	to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow 
1	gabriel thou hadst in heav n th esteem of wise 
1	and such i held thee but this question askt
1	puts me in doubt lives ther who loves his pain 
1	who would not finding way break loose from hell 
1	though thither doomd thou wouldst thy self no doubt 
1	and boldly venture to whatever place
1	farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
1	torment with ease soonest recompence
1	dole with delight which in this place i sought 
1	to thee no reason who knowst only good 
1	but evil hast not tri d and wilt object
1	his will who bound us let him surer barr
1	his iron gates if he intends our stay
1	in that dark durance thus much what was askt 
1	the rest is true they found me where they say 
1	but that implies not violence or harme 
1	thus hee in scorn the warlike angel mov d 
1	disdainfully half smiling thus repli d 
1	o loss of one in heav n to judge of wise 
1	since satan fell whom follie overthrew 
1	and now returns him from his prison scap t 
1	gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
1	or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
1	unlicenc t from his bounds in hell prescrib d 
1	so wise he judges it to fly from pain
1	however and to scape his punishment 
1	so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrauth 
1	which thou incurr st by flying meet thy flight
1	seavenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell 
1	which taught thee yet no better that no pain
1	can equal anger infinite provok t 
1	but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee
1	came not all hell broke loose is pain to them
1	less pain less to be fled or thou then they
1	less hardie to endure courageous chief 
1	the first in flight from pain had st thou alleg d
1	to thy deserted host this cause of flight 
1	thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive 
1	to which the fiend thus answerd frowning stern 
1	not that i less endure or shrink from pain 
1	insulting angel well thou knowst i stood
1	thy fiercest when in battel to thy aide
1	the blasting volied thunder made all speed
1	and seconded thy else not dreaded spear 
1	but still thy words at random as before 
1	argue thy inexperience what behooves
1	from hard assaies and ill successes past
1	a faithful leader not to hazard all
1	through wayes of danger by himself untri d 
1	i therefore i alone first undertook
1	to wing the desolate abyss and spie
1	this new created world whereof in hell
1	fame is not silent here in hope to find
1	better abode and my afflicted powers
1	to settle here on earth or in mid aire 
1	though for possession put to try once more
1	what thou and thy gay legions dare against 
1	whose easier business were to serve thir lord
1	high up in heav n with songs to hymne his throne 
1	and practis d distances to cringe not fight 
1	to whom the warriour angel soon repli d 
1	to say and strait unsay pretending first
1	wise to flie pain professing next the spie 
1	argues no leader but a lyar trac t 
1	satan and couldst thou faithful add o name 
1	o sacred name of faithfulness profan d 
1	faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew 
1	armie of fiends fit body to fit head 
1	was this your discipline and faith ingag d 
1	your military obedience to dissolve
1	allegeance to th acknowledg d power supream 
1	and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
1	patron of liberty who more then thou
1	once fawn d and cring d and servilly ador d
1	heav ns awful monarch wherefore but in hope
1	to dispossess him and thy self to reigne 
1	but mark what i arreede thee now avant 
1	flie thither whence thou fledst if from this houre
1	within these hallowd limits thou appeer 
1	back to th infernal pit i drag thee chaind 
1	and seale thee so as henceforth not to scorne
1	the facil gates of hell too slightly barrd 
1	so threatn d hee but satan to no threats
1	gave heed but waxing more in rage repli d 
1	then when i am thy captive talk of chaines 
1	proud limitarie cherube but ere then
1	farr heavier load thy self expect to feel
1	from my prevailing arme though heavens king
1	ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers 
1	us d to the yoak draw st his triumphant wheels
1	in progress through the rode of heav n star pav d 
1	while thus he spake th angelic squadron bright
1	turnd fierie red sharpning in mooned hornes
1	thir phalanx and began to hemm him round
1	with ported spears as thick as when a field
1	of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
1	her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
1	swayes them the careful plowman doubting stands
1	least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves
1	prove chaff on th other side satan allarm d
1	collecting all his might dilated stood 
1	like teneriff or atlas unremov d 
1	his stature reacht the skie and on his crest
1	sat horror plum d nor wanted in his graspe
1	what seemd both spear and shield now dreadful deeds
1	might have ensu d nor onely paradise
1	in this commotion but the starrie cope
1	of heav n perhaps or all the elements
1	at least had gon to rack disturbd and torne
1	with violence of this conflict had not soon
1	th eternal to prevent such horrid fray
1	hung forth in heav n his golden scales yet seen
1	betwixt astrea and the scorpion signe 
1	wherein all things created first he weighd 
1	the pendulous round earth with ballanc t aire
1	in counterpoise now ponders all events 
1	battels and realms in these he put two weights
1	the sequel each of parting and of fight 
1	the latter quick up flew and kickt the beam 
1	which gabriel spying thus bespake the fiend 
1	satan i know thy strength and thou knowst mine 
1	neither our own but giv n what follie then
1	to boast what arms can doe since thine no more
1	then heav n permits nor mine though doubld now
1	to trample thee as mire for proof look up 
1	and read thy lot in yon celestial sign
1	where thou art weigh d shown how light how weak 
1	if thou resist the fiend lookt up and knew
1	his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled
1	murmuring and with him fled the shades of night 
1	now morn her rosie steps in th eastern clime
1	advancing sow d the earth with orient pearle 
1	when adam wak t so customd for his sleep
1	was aerie light from pure digestion bred 
1	and temperat vapors bland which th only sound
1	of leaves and fuming rills aurora s fan 
1	lightly dispers d and the shrill matin song
1	of birds on every bough so much the more
1	his wonder was to find unwak nd eve
1	with tresses discompos d and glowing cheek 
1	as through unquiet rest he on his side
1	leaning half rais d with looks of cordial love
1	hung over her enamour d and beheld
1	beautie which whether waking or asleep 
1	shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
1	milde as when zephyrus on flora breathes 
1	her hand soft touching whisperd thus awake
1	my fairest my espous d my latest found 
1	heav ns last best gift my ever new delight 
1	awake the morning shines and the fresh field
1	calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
1	our tended plants how blows the citron grove 
1	what drops the myrrhe what the balmie reed 
1	how nature paints her colours how the bee
1	sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet 
1	such whispering wak d her but with startl d eye
1	on adam whom imbracing thus she spake 
1	o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose 
1	my glorie my perfection glad i see
1	thy face and morn return d for i this night 
1	such night till this i never pass d have dream d 
1	if dream d not as i oft am wont of thee 
1	works of day pass t or morrows next designe 
1	but of offence and trouble which my mind
1	knew never till this irksom night methought
1	close at mine ear one call d me forth to walk
1	with gentle voice i thought it thine it said 
1	why sleepst thou eve now is the pleasant time 
1	the cool the silent save where silence yields
1	to the night warbling bird that now awake
1	tunes sweetest his love labor d song now reignes
1	full orb d the moon and with more pleasing light
1	shadowie sets off the face of things in vain 
1	if none regard heav n wakes with all his eyes 
1	whom to behold but thee natures desire 
1	in whose sight all things joy with ravishment
1	attracted by thy beauty still to gaze 
1	i rose as at thy call but found thee not 
1	to find thee i directed then my walk 
1	and on methought alone i pass d through ways
1	that brought me on a sudden to the tree
1	of interdicted knowledge fair it seem d 
1	much fairer to my fancie then by day 
1	and as i wondring lookt beside it stood
1	one shap d wing d like one of those from heav n
1	by us oft seen his dewie locks distill d
1	ambrosia on that tree he also gaz d 
1	and o fair plant said he with fruit surcharg d 
1	deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet 
1	nor god nor man is knowledge so despis d 
1	or envie or what reserve forbids to taste 
1	forbid who will none shall from me withhold
1	longer thy offerd good why else set here 
1	this said he paus d not but with ventrous arme
1	he pluckt he tasted mee damp horror chil d
1	at such bold words voucht with a deed so bold 
1	but he thus overjoy d o fruit divine 
1	sweet of thy self but much more sweet thus cropt 
1	forbidd n here it seems as onely fit
1	for gods yet able to make gods of men 
1	and why not gods of men since good the more
1	communicated more abundant growes 
1	the author not impair d but honourd more 
1	here happie creature fair angelic eve 
1	partake thou also happie though thou art 
1	happier thou mayst be worthier canst not be 
1	taste this and be henceforth among the gods
1	thy self a goddess not to earth confind 
1	but somtimes in the air as wee somtimes
1	ascend to heav n by merit thine and see
1	what life the gods live there and such live thou 
1	so saying he drew nigh and to me held 
1	even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
1	which he had pluckt the pleasant savourie smell
1	so quick nd appetite that i methought 
1	could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds
1	with him i flew and underneath beheld
1	the earth outstretcht immense a prospect wide
1	and various wondring at my flight and change
1	to this high exaltation suddenly
1	my guide was gon and i me thought sunk down 
1	and fell asleep but o how glad i wak d
1	to find this but a dream thus eve her night
1	related and thus adam answerd sad 
1	best image of my self and dearer half 
1	the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
1	affects me equally nor can i like
1	this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear 
1	yet evil whence in thee can harbour none 
1	created pure but know that in the soule
1	are many lesser faculties that serve
1	reason as chief among these fansie next
1	her office holds of all external things 
1	which the five watchful senses represent 
1	she forms imaginations aerie shapes 
1	which reason joyning or disjoyning frames
1	all what we affirm or what deny and call
1	our knowledge or opinion then retires
1	into her private cell when nature rests 
1	oft in her absence mimic fansie wakes
1	to imitate her but misjoyning shapes 
1	wilde work produces oft and most in dreams 
1	ill matching words and deeds long past or late 
1	som such resemblances methinks i find
1	of our last eevnings talk in this thy dream 
1	but with addition strange yet be not sad 
1	evil into the mind of god or man
1	may come and go so unapprov d and leave
1	no spot or blame behind which gives me hope
1	that what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream 
1	waking thou never wilt consent to do 
1	be not disheart nd then nor cloud those looks
1	that wont to be more chearful and serene
1	then when fair morning first smiles on the world 
1	and let us to our fresh imployments rise
1	that open now thir choicest bosom d smells
1	reservd from night and kept for thee in store 
1	so cheard he his fair spouse and she was cheard 
1	but silently a gentle tear let fall
1	from either eye and wip d them with her haire 
1	two other precious drops that ready stood 
1	each in thir chrystal sluce hee ere they fell
1	kiss d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
1	and pious awe that feard to have offended 
1	so all was cleard and to the field they haste 
1	but first from under shadie arborous roof 
1	soon as they forth were come to open sight
1	of day spring and the sun who scarce up risen
1	with wheels yet hov ring o re the ocean brim 
1	shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray 
1	discovering in wide lantskip all the east
1	of paradise and edens happie plains 
1	lowly they bow d adoring and began
1	thir orisons each morning duly paid
1	in various style for neither various style
1	nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
1	thir maker in fit strains pronounc t or sung
1	unmeditated such prompt eloquence
1	flowd from thir lips in prose or numerous verse 
1	more tuneable then needed lute or harp
1	to add more sweetness and they thus began 
1	these are thy glorious works parent of good 
1	almightie thine this universal frame 
1	thus wondrous fair thy self how wondrous then 
1	unspeakable who sitst above these heavens
1	to us invisible or dimly seen

1	impearls on every leaf and every flouer 
1	regions they pass d the mightie regencies

1	then what this garden is to all the earth

1	they came and satan to his royal seat

1	the mountain of the congregation call d 
1	for thither he assembl d all his train 
1	pretending so commanded to consult

1	thither to come and with calumnious art
1	of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears 
1	if these magnific titles yet remain
1	not meerly titular since by decree
1	another now hath to himself ingross t

1	with what may be devis d of honours new
1	receive him coming to receive from us
1	knee tribute yet unpaid prostration vile 
1	too much to one but double how endur d 
1	to one and to his image now proclaim d 
1	but what if better counsels might erect
1	our minds and teach us to cast off this yoke 
1	will ye submit your necks and chuse to bend
1	the supple knee ye will not if i trust
1	to know ye right or if ye know your selves
1	natives and sons of heav n possest before
1	by none and if not equal all yet free 
1	equally free for orders and degrees
1	jarr not with liberty but well consist 
1	who can in reason then or right assume

1	thus farr his bold discourse without controule

1	the deitie and divine commands obei d 
1	stood up and in a flame of zeale severe
1	the current of his fury thus oppos d 
1	o argument blasphemous false and proud 
1	words which no eare ever to hear in heav n
1	expected least of all from thee ingrate
1	in place thy self so high above thy peeres 
1	canst thou with impious obloquie condemne

1	shalt thou give law to god shalt thou dispute

1	on those proud towrs to swift destruction doom d 
1	all night the dreadless angel unpursu d
1	through heav ns wide champain held his way till morn 
1	wak t by the circling hours with rosie hand
1	unbarr d the gates of light there is a cave

1	lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through heav n
1	grateful vicissitude like day and night 
1	light issues forth and at the other dore
1	obsequious darkness enters till her houre
1	to veile the heav n though darkness there might well

1	returnd not lost on to the sacred hill
1	they led him high applauded and present

1	servant of god well done well hast thou fought

1	in the mid way though strange to us it seemd
1	at first that angel should with angel warr 
1	and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet
1	so oft in festivals of joy and love
1	unanimous as sons of one great sire
1	hymning th eternal father but the shout
1	of battel now began and rushing sound
1	of onset ended soon each milder thought 
1	high in the midst exalted as a god

1	idol of majestie divine enclos d
1	with flaming cherubim and golden shields

1	 twixt host and host but narrow space was left 
1	a dreadful interval and front to front
1	presented stood in terrible array
1	of hideous length before the cloudie van

1	among the mightiest bent on highest deeds 
1	and thus his own undaunted heart explores 
1	o heav n that such resemblance of the highest
1	should yet remain where faith and realtie
1	remain not wherfore should not strength might
1	there fail where vertue fails or weakest prove
1	where boldest though to sight unconquerable 
1	his puissance trusting in th almightie s aide 
1	i mean to try whose reason i have tri d
1	unsound and false nor is it aught but just 
1	that he who in debate of truth hath won 
1	should win in arms in both disputes alike
1	victor though brutish that contest and foule 
1	when reason hath to deal with force yet so
1	most reason is that reason overcome 
1	so pondering and from his armed peers
1	forth stepping opposite half way he met

1	incens t and thus securely him defi d 
1	proud art thou met thy hope was to have reacht
1	the highth of thy aspiring unoppos d 
1	the throne of god unguarded and his side

1	god hath assign d us nor of me shalt pass
1	unprais d for nothing lovelier can be found
1	in woman then to studie houshold good

1	safest and seemliest by her husband staies

1	ofspring of heav n and earth and all earths lord 
1	that such an enemie we have who seeks
1	our ruin both by thee informd i learne 
1	and from the parting angel over heard
1	as in a shadie nook i stood behind 
1	just then returnd at shut of evening flours 
1	but that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
1	to god or thee because we have a foe
1	may tempt it i expected not to hear 
1	his violence thou fearst not being such 
1	as wee not capable of death or paine 
1	can either not receave or can repell 
1	his fraud is then thy fear which plain inferrs
1	thy equal fear that my firm faith and love
1	can by his fraud be shak n or seduc t 
1	thoughts which how found they harbour in thy brest 
1	adam misthought of her to thee so dear 
1	to whom with healing words adam reply d 
1	daughter of god and man immortal eve 
1	for such thou art from sin and blame entire 
1	not diffident of thee do i dissuade
1	thy absence from my sight but to avoid
1	th attempt it self intended by our foe 
1	for hee who tempts though in vain at least asperses
1	the tempted with dishonour foul suppos d
1	not incorruptible of faith not prooff
1	against temptation thou thy self with scorne
1	and anger wouldst resent the offer d wrong 
1	though ineffectual found misdeem not then 
1	if such affront i labour to avert
1	from thee alone which on us both at once
1	the enemie though bold will hardly dare 
1	or daring first on mee th assault shall light 
1	nor thou his malice and false guile contemn 
1	suttle he needs must be who could seduce
1	angels nor think superfluous others aid 
1	i from the influence of thy looks receave
1	access in every vertue in thy sight
1	more wise more watchful stronger if need were
1	of outward strength while shame thou looking on 
1	shame to be overcome or over reacht
1	would utmost vigor raise and rais d unite 
1	why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
1	when i am present and thy trial choose
1	with me best witness of thy vertue tri d 
1	so spake domestick adam in his care
1	and matrimonial love but eve who thought
1	less attributed to her faith sincere 
1	thus her reply with accent sweet renewd 
1	if this be our condition thus to dwell
1	in narrow circuit strait nd by a foe 
1	suttle or violent we not endu d
1	single with like defence wherever met 
1	how are we happie still in fear of harm 
1	but harm precedes not sin onely our foe
1	tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
1	of our integritie his foul esteeme
1	sticks no dishonor on our front but turns
1	foul on himself then wherfore shund or feard
1	by us who rather double honour gaine
1	from his surmise prov d false finde peace within 
1	favour from heav n our witness from th event 
1	and what is faith love vertue unassaid
1	alone without exterior help sustaind 
1	let us not then suspect our happie state
1	left so imperfet by the maker wise 
1	as not secure to single or combin d 
1	fraile is our happiness if this be so 
1	and eden were no eden thus expos d 
1	to whom thus adam fervently repli d 
1	o woman best are all things as the will
1	of god ordaind them his creating hand
1	nothing imperfet or deficient left
1	of all that he created much less man 
1	or ought that might his happie state secure 
1	secure from outward force within himself
1	the danger lies yet lies within his power 
1	against his will he can receave no harme 
1	but god left free the will for what obeyes
1	reason is free and reason he made right 
1	but bid her well beware and still erect 
1	least by some faire appeering good surpris d
1	she dictate false and missinforme the will
1	to do what god expresly hath forbid 
1	not then mistrust but tender love enjoynes 
1	that i should mind thee oft and mind thou me 
1	firm we subsist yet possible to swerve 
1	since reason not impossibly may meet
1	some specious object by the foe subornd 
1	and fall into deception unaware 
1	not keeping strictest watch as she was warnd 
1	seek not temptation then which to avoide
1	were better and most likelie if from mee
1	thou sever not trial will come unsought 
1	wouldst thou approve thy constancie approve
1	first thy obedience th other who can know 
1	not seeing thee attempted who attest 
1	but if thou think trial unsought may finde
1	us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst 
1	go for thy stay not free absents thee more 
1	go in thy native innocence relie
1	on what thou hast of vertue summon all 
1	for god towards thee hath done his part do thine 
1	so spake the patriarch of mankinde but eve
1	persisted yet submiss though last repli d 
1	with thy permission then and thus forewarnd
1	chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
1	touchd onely that our trial when least sought 
1	may finde us both perhaps farr less prepar d 
1	the willinger i goe nor much expect
1	a foe so proud will first the weaker seek 
1	so bent the more shall shame him his repulse 
1	thus saying from her husbands hand her hand
1	soft she withdrew and like a wood nymph light

1	for many are the trees of god that grow
1	in paradise and various yet unknown
1	to us in such abundance lies our choice 
1	as leaves a greater store of fruit untoucht

1	god so commanded and left that command
1	sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
1	law to our selves our reason is our law 
1	to whom the tempter guilefully repli d

1	the tempter all impassiond thus began 
1	o sacred wise and wisdom giving plant 
1	mother of science now i feel thy power
1	within me cleere not onely to discerne
1	things in thir causes but to trace the wayes
1	of highest agents deemd however wise 
1	queen of this universe doe not believe
1	those rigid threats of death ye shall not die 
1	how should ye by the fruit it gives you life
1	to knowledge by the threatner look on mee 
1	mee who have touch d and tasted yet both live 
1	and life more perfet have attaind then fate
1	meant mee by ventring higher then my lot 
1	shall that be shut to man which to the beast
1	is open or will god incense his ire
1	for such a pretty trespass and not praise
1	rather your dauntless vertue whom the pain
1	of death denounc t whatever thing death be 
1	deterrd not from atchieving what might leade
1	to happier life knowledge of good and evil 
1	of good how just of evil if what is evil
1	be real why not known since easier shunnd 
1	god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just 
1	not just not god not feard then nor obeid 
1	your feare it self of death removes the feare 
1	why then was this forbid why but to awe 
1	why but to keep ye low and ignorant 
1	his worshippers he knows that in the day
1	ye eate thereof your eyes that seem so cleere 
1	yet are but dim shall perfetly be then
1	op nd and cleerd and ye shall be as gods 
1	knowing both good and evil as they know 
1	that ye should be as gods since i as man 
1	internal man is but proportion meet 
1	i of brute human yee of human gods 
1	so ye shalt die perhaps by putting off
1	human to put on gods death to be wisht 
1	though threat nd which no worse then this can bring
1	and what are gods that man may not become
1	as they participating god like food 
1	the gods are first and that advantage use
1	on our belief that all from them proceeds 
1	i question it for this fair earth i see 
1	warm d by the sun producing every kind 
1	them nothing if they all things who enclos d
1	knowledge of good and evil in this tree 
1	that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
1	wisdom without their leave and wherein lies
1	th offence that man should thus attain to know 
1	what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
1	impart against his will if all be his 
1	or is it envie and can envie dwell
1	in heav nly brests these these and many more
1	causes import your need of this fair fruit 
1	goddess humane reach then and freely taste 
1	he ended and his words replete with guile
1	into her heart too easie entrance won 
1	fixt on the fruit she gaz d which to behold
1	might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
1	yet rung of his perswasive words impregn d
1	with reason to her seeming and with truth 
1	meanwhile the hour of noon drew on and wak d
1	an eager appetite rais d by the smell
1	so savorie of that fruit which with desire 
1	inclinable now grown to touch or taste 
1	sollicited her longing eye yet first
1	pausing a while thus to her self she mus d 
1	great are thy vertues doubtless best of fruits 
1	though kept from man worthy to be admir d 
1	whose taste too long forborn at first assay
1	gave elocution to the mute and taught
1	the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise 
1	thy praise hee also who forbids thy use 
1	conceales not from us naming thee the tree
1	of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil 
1	forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
1	commends thee more while it inferrs the good
1	by thee communicated and our want 
1	for good unknown sure is not had or had
1	and yet unknown is as not had at all 
1	in plain then what forbids he but to know 
1	forbids us good forbids us to be wise 
1	such prohibitions binde not but if death
1	bind us with after bands what profits then
1	our inward freedom in the day we eate
1	of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die 
1	how dies the serpent hee hath eat n and lives 
1	and knows and speaks and reasons and discernes 
1	irrational till then for us alone
1	was death invented or to us deni d
1	this intellectual food for beasts reserv d 
1	for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
1	hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
1	the good befall n him author unsuspect 
1	friendly to man farr from deceit or guile 
1	what fear i then rather what know to feare
1	under this ignorance of good and evil 
1	here grows the cure of all this fruit divine 
1	fair to the eye inviting to the taste 
1	of vertue to make wise what hinders then
1	to reach and feed at once both bodie and mind 
1	so saying her rash hand in evil hour
1	forth reaching to the fruit she pluck d she eat 
1	earth felt the wound and nature from her seat
1	sighing through all her works gave signs of woe 
1	that all was lost back to the thicket slunk
1	the guiltie serpent and well might for eve
1	intent now wholly on her taste naught else
1	regarded such delight till then as seemd 
1	in fruit she never tasted whether true
1	or fansied so through expectation high
1	of knowledg nor was god head from her thought 
1	greedily she ingorg d without restraint 
1	and knew not eating death satiate at length 
1	and hight nd as with wine jocond and boon 
1	thus to her self she pleasingly began 
1	o sovran vertuous precious of all trees
1	in paradise of operation blest
1	to sapience hitherto obscur d infam d 
1	and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
1	created but henceforth my early care 
1	not without song each morning and due praise
1	shall tend thee and the fertil burden ease
1	of thy full branches offer d free to all 
1	till dieted by thee i grow mature
1	in knowledge as the gods who all things know 
1	though others envie what they cannot give 
1	for had the gift bin theirs it had not here
1	thus grown experience next to thee i owe 
1	best guide not following thee i had remaind
1	in ignorance thou op nst wisdoms way 
1	and giv st access though secret she retire 
1	and i perhaps am secret heav n is high 
1	high and remote to see from thence distinct
1	each thing on earth and other care perhaps
1	may have diverted from continual watch
1	our great forbidder safe with all his spies
1	about him but to adam in what sort
1	shall i appeer shall i to him make known
1	as yet my change and give him to partake
1	full happiness with mee or rather not 
1	but keep the odds of knowledge in my power
1	without copartner so to add what wants
1	in femal sex the more to draw his love 
1	and render me more equal and perhaps
1	a thing not undesireable somtime
1	superior for inferior who is free 
1	this may be well but what if god have seen 
1	and death ensue then i shall be no more 
1	and adam wedded to another eve 
1	shall live with her enjoying i extinct 
1	a death to think confirm d then i resolve 
1	adam shall share with me in bliss or woe 
1	so dear i love him that with him all deaths
1	i could endure without him live no life 
1	so saying from the tree her step she turnd 
1	but first low reverence don as to the power
1	that dwelt within whose presence had infus d
1	into the plant sciential sap deriv d
1	from nectar drink of gods adam the while
1	waiting desirous her return had wove
1	of choicest flours a garland to adorne
1	her tresses and her rural labours crown
1	as reapers oft are wont thir harvest queen 
1	great joy he promis d to his thoughts and new
1	solace in her return so long delay d 
1	yet oft his heart divine of somthing ill 
1	misgave him hee the faultring measure felt 
1	and forth to meet her went the way she took
1	that morn when first they parted by the tree
1	of knowledge he must pass there he her met 
1	scarse from the tree returning in her hand
1	a bough of fairest fruit that downie smil d 
1	new gatherd and ambrosial smell diffus d 
1	to him she hasted in her face excuse
1	came prologue and apologie to prompt 
1	which with bland words at will she thus addrest 
1	hast thou not wonderd adam at my stay 
1	thee i have misst and thought it long depriv d
1	thy presence agonie of love till now
1	not felt nor shall be twice for never more
1	mean i to trie what rash untri d i sought 
1	the paine of absence from thy sight but strange
1	hath bin the cause and wonderful to heare 
1	this tree is not as we are told a tree
1	of danger tasted nor to evil unknown
1	op ning the way but of divine effect
1	to open eyes and make them gods who taste 
1	and hath bin tasted such the serpent wise 
1	or not restraind as wee or not obeying 
1	hath eat n of the fruit and is become 
1	not dead as we are threatn d but thenceforth
1	endu d with human voice and human sense 
1	reasoning to admiration and with mee
1	perswasively hath so prevaild that i
1	have also tasted and have also found
1	th effects to correspond opener mine eyes 
1	dimm erst dilated spirits ampler heart 
1	and growing up to godhead which for thee
1	chiefly i sought without thee can despise 
1	for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss 
1	tedious unshar d with thee and odious soon 
1	thou therefore also taste that equal lot
1	may joyne us equal joy as equal love 
1	least thou not tasting different degree
1	disjoyne us and i then too late renounce
1	deitie for thee when fate will not permit 
1	thus eve with countnance blithe her storie told 
1	but in her cheek distemper flushing glowd 
1	on th other side adam soon as he heard
1	the fatal trespass don by eve amaz d 
1	astonied stood and blank while horror chill
1	ran through his veins and all his joynts relax d 
1	from his slack hand the garland wreath d for eve
1	down drop d and all the faded roses shed 
1	speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
1	first to himself he inward silence broke 
1	o fairest of creation last and best
1	of all gods works creature in whom excell d
1	whatever can to fight or thought be found 
1	holy divine good amiable or sweet 
1	how art thou lost how on a sudden lost 
1	defac t deflourd and now to death devote 
1	rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress
1	the strict forbiddance how to violate
1	the sacred fruit forbidd n som cursed fraud
1	of enemie hath beguil d thee yet unknown 
1	and mee with thee hath ruind for with thee
1	certain my resolution is to die 
1	how can i live without thee how forgoe
1	thy sweet converse and love so dearly joyn d 
1	to live again in these wilde woods forlorn 
1	should god create another eve and i
1	another rib afford yet loss of thee
1	would never from my heart no no i feel
1	the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh 
1	bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
1	mine never shall be parted bliss or woe 
1	so having said as one from sad dismay
1	recomforted and after thoughts disturbd
1	submitting to what seemd remediless 
1	thus in calme mood his words to eve he turnd 
1	bold deed thou hast presum d adventrous eve 
1	and peril great provok t who thus hast dar d
1	had it bin onely coveting to eye
1	that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence 
1	much more to taste it under banne to touch 
1	but past who can recall or don undoe 
1	not god omnipotent for fate yet so
1	perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
1	is not so hainous now foretasted fruit 
1	profan d first by the serpent by him first
1	made common and unhallowd ere one tastes 
1	nor yet on him found deadly he yet lives 
1	lives as thou saidst and gaines to live as man
1	higher degree of life inducement strong
1	to us as likely tasting to attaine
1	proportional ascent which cannot be
1	but to be gods or angels demi gods 
1	nor can i think that god creator wise 
1	though threatning will in earnest so destroy
1	us his prime creatures dignifi d so high 
1	set over all his works which in our fall 
1	for us created needs with us must faile

1	tenderly wept much won that he his love
1	had so enobl d as of choice to incurr
1	divine displeasure for her sake or death 
1	in recompence for such compliance bad
1	such recompence best merits from the bough
1	she gave him of that fair enticing fruit
1	with liberal hand he scrupl d not to eat
1	against his better knowledge not deceav d 
1	but fondly overcome with femal charm 
1	earth trembl d from her entrails as again
1	in pangs and nature gave a second groan

1	wept at compleating of the mortal sin

1	wherewith to scorn the earth but that false fruit
1	farr other operation first displaid

1	began to cast lascivious eyes she him
1	as wantonly repaid in lust they burne 
1	till adam thus gan eve to dalliance move 
1	eve now i see thou art exact of taste 
1	and elegant of sapience no small part 
1	since to each meaning savour we apply 
1	and palate call judicious i the praise
1	yeild thee so well this day thou hast purvey d 
1	much pleasure we have lost while we abstain d
1	from this delightful fruit nor known till now
1	true relish tasting if such pleasure be
1	in things to us forbidden it might be wish d 
1	for this one tree had bin forbidden ten 
1	but come so well refresh t now let us play 
1	as meet is after such delicious fare 
1	for never did thy beautie since the day
1	i saw thee first and wedded thee adorn d
1	with all perfections so enflame my sense
1	with ardor to enjoy thee fairer now
1	then ever bountie of this vertuous tree 
1	so said he and forbore not glance or toy
1	of amorous intent well understood
1	of eve whose eye darted contagious fire 
1	her hand he seis d and to a shadie bank 
1	thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr d
1	he led her nothing loath flours were the couch 
1	and hyacinth earths freshest softest lap 
1	there they thir fill of love and loves disport
1	took largely of thir mutual guilt the seale 
1	the solace of thir sin till dewie sleep
1	oppress d them wearied with thir amorous play 
1	soon as the force of that fallacious fruit 
1	that with exhilerating vapour bland
1	about thir spirits had plaid and inmost powers
1	made erre was now exhal d and grosser sleep
1	bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
1	encumberd now had left them up they rose
1	as from unrest and each the other viewing 
1	soon found thir eyes how op nd and thir minds
1	how dark nd innocence that as a veile
1	had shadow d them from knowing ill was gon 
1	just confidence and native righteousness 
1	and honour from about them naked left
1	to guiltie shame hee cover d but his robe
1	uncover d more so rose the danite strong
1	herculean samson from the harlot lap
1	shorn of his strength they destitute and bare
1	of all thir vertue silent and in face
1	confounded long they sate as struck n mute 
1	till adam though not less then eve abasht 
1	at length gave utterance to these words constraind 
1	o eve in evil hour thou didst give care
1	to that false worm of whomsoever taught
1	to counterfet mans voice true in our fall 
1	false in our promis d rising since our eyes
1	op nd we find indeed and find we know
1	both good and evil good lost and evil got 
1	bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know 
1	which leaves us naked thus of honour void 
1	our wonted ornaments now soild and staind 
1	and in our faces evident the signes
1	of foul concupiscence whence evil store 
1	even shame the last of evils of the first
1	be sure then how shall i behold the face
1	henceforth of god or angel earst with joy
1	and rapture so oft beheld those heav nly shapes
1	will dazle now this earthly with thir blaze
1	insufferably bright o might i here
1	in solitude live savage in some glad
1	obscur d where highest woods impenetrable
1	to starr or sun light spread thir umbrage broad 
1	and brown as evening cover me ye pines 
1	ye cedars with innumerable boughs
1	hide me where i may never see them more 
1	but let us now as in bad plight devise
1	what best may for the present serve to hide
1	the parts of each from other that seem most
1	to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen 
1	some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sowd 
1	and girded on our loyns may cover round
1	those middle parts that this new commer shame 
1	there sit not and reproach us as unclean 
1	so counsel d hee and both together went
1	into the thickest wood there soon they chose
1	the figtree not that kind for fruit renown d 
1	but such as at this day to indians known
1	in malabar or decan spreds her armes
1	braunching so broad and long that in the ground
1	the bended twigs take root and daughters grow
1	about the mother tree a pillard shade
1	high overarch t and echoing walks between 
1	there oft the indian herdsman shunning heate
1	shelters in coole and tends his pasturing herds
1	at loopholes cut through thickest shade those leaves
1	they gatherd broad as amazonian targe 
1	and with what skill they had together sowd

1	accompanied to heaven gate from whence
1	eden and all the coast in prospect lay 
1	down he descended strait the speed of gods
1	time counts not though with swiftest minutes wing d 
1	now was the sun in western cadence low
1	from noon and gentle aires due at thir hour
1	to fan the earth now wak d and usher in
1	the eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole
1	came the mild judge and intercessor both
1	to sentence man the voice of god they heard
1	now walking in the garden by soft windes
1	brought to thir ears while day declin d they heard
1	and from his presence hid themselves among

1	approaching thus to adam call d aloud

1	absents thee or what chance detains come forth 
1	he came and with him eve more loth though first
1	to offend discount nanc t both and discompos d 
1	love was not in thir looks either to god
1	or to each other but apparent guilt 
1	and shame and perturbation and despaire 
1	anger and obstinacie and hate and guile 
1	whence adam faultring long thus answer d brief 
1	i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
1	affraid being naked hid my self to whom
1	the gracious judge without revile repli d 
1	my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not fear d 
1	but still rejoyc t how is it now become
1	so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who
1	hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree
1	whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat 
1	to whom thus adam sore beset repli d 
1	o heav n in evil strait this day i stand
1	before my judge either to undergoe
1	my self the total crime or to accuse
1	my other self the partner of my life 
1	whose failing while her faith to me remaines 
1	i should conceal and not expose to blame
1	by my complaint but strict necessitie
1	subdues me and calamitous constraint 
1	least on my head both sin and punishment 
1	however insupportable be all
1	devolv d though should i hold my peace yet thou
1	wouldst easily detect what i conceale 
1	this woman whom thou mad st to be my help 
1	and gav st me as thy perfet gift so good 
1	so fit so acceptable so divine 
1	that from her hand i could suspect no ill 
1	and what she did whatever in it self 
1	her doing seem d to justifie the deed 
1	shee gave me of the tree and i did eate 
1	to whom the sovran presence thus repli d 
1	was shee thy god that her thou didst obey
1	before his voice or was shee made thy guide 
1	superior or but equal that to her
1	thou did st resigne thy manhood and the place
1	wherein god set thee above her made of thee 
1	and for thee whose perfection farr excell d
1	hers in all real dignitie adornd
1	she was indeed and lovely to attract
1	were such as under government well seem d 
1	unseemly to beare rule which was thy part
1	and person had st thou known thy self aright 
1	so having said he thus to eve in few 
1	say woman what is this which thou hast done 
1	to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm d 
1	confessing soon yet not before her judge
1	bold or loquacious thus abasht repli d 
1	the serpent me beguil d and i did eate 
1	which when the lord god heard without delay
1	to judgement he proceeded on th accus d
1	serpent though brute unable to transferre
1	the guilt on him who made him instrument
1	of mischief and polluted from the end
1	of his creation justly then accurst 
1	as vitiated in nature more to know
1	concern d not man since he no further knew 
1	nor alter d his offence yet god at last
1	to satan first in sin his doom apply d 
1	though in mysterious terms judg d as then best 
1	and on the serpent thus his curse let fall 
1	because thou hast done this thou art accurst
1	above all cattel each beast of the field 
1	upon thy belly groveling thou shalt goe 
1	and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life 
1	between thee and the woman i will put
1	enmitie and between thine and her seed 
1	her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel 
1	so spake this oracle then verifi d
1	when jesus son of mary second eve 
1	saw satan fall like lightning down from heav n 
1	prince of the aire then rising from his grave
1	spoild principalities and powers triumpht
1	in open shew and with ascention bright
1	captivity led captive through the aire 
1	the realme it self of satan long usurpt 
1	whom he shall tread at last under our feet 
1	eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise 
1	and to the woman thus his sentence turn d 
1	thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie
1	by thy conception children thou shalt bring
1	in sorrow forth and to thy husbands will
1	thine shall submit hee over thee shall rule 
1	on adam last thus judgement he pronounc d 
1	because thou hast heark nd to the voice of thy wife 
1	and eaten of the tree concerning which
1	i charg d thee saying thou shalt not eate thereof 
1	curs d is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
1	shalt eate thereof all the days of thy life 
1	thornes also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
1	unbid and thou shalt eate th herb of th field 
1	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread 
1	till thou return unto the ground for thou
1	out of the ground wast taken know thy birth 
1	for dust thou art and shalt to dust returne 
1	so judg d he man both judge and saviour sent 
1	and th instant stroke of death denounc t that day
1	remov d farr off then pittying how they stood
1	before him naked to the aire that now
1	must suffer change disdain d not to begin
1	thenceforth the forme of servant to assume 
1	as when he wash d his servants feet so now
1	as father of his familie he clad
1	thir nakedness with skins of beasts or slain 
1	or as the snake with youthful coate repaid 
1	and thought not much to cloath his enemies 
1	nor hee thir outward onely with the skins
1	of beasts but inward nakedness much more
1	opprobrious with his robe of righteousness 
1	araying cover d from his fathers sight 
1	to him with swift ascent he up returnd 
1	into his blissful bosom reassum d
1	in glory as of old to him appeas d
1	all though all knowing what had past with man
1	recounted mixing intercession sweet 
1	meanwhile ere thus was sin d and judg d on earth 
1	within the gates of hell sate sin and death 
1	in counterview within the gates that now
1	stood open wide belching outrageous flame
1	farr into chaos since the fiend pass d through 
1	sin opening who thus now to death began 
1	o son why sit we here each other viewing
1	idlely while satan our great author thrives
1	in other worlds and happier seat provides
1	for us his ofspring deare it cannot be
1	but that success attends him if mishap 
1	ere this he had return d with fury driv n
1	by his avenger since no place like this
1	can fit his punishment or their revenge 
1	methinks i feel new strength within me rise 
1	wings growing and dominion giv n me large
1	beyond this deep whatever drawes me on 
1	or sympathie or som connatural force
1	powerful at greatest distance to unite
1	with secret amity things of like kinde
1	by secretest conveyance thou my shade
1	inseparable must with mee along 
1	for death from sin no power can separate 
1	but least the difficultie of passing back
1	stay his returne perhaps over this gulfe
1	impassable impervious let us try
1	adventrous work yet to thy power and mine
1	not unagreeable to found a path
1	over this maine from hell to that new world
1	where satan now prevailes a monument
1	of merit high to all th infernal host 
1	easing thir passage hence for intercourse 
1	or transmigration as thir lot shall lead 
1	nor can i miss the way so strongly drawn
1	by this new felt attraction and instinct

1	nor shall i to the work thou enterprisest
1	be wanting but afford thee equal aid 
1	so saying with delight he snuff d the smell
1	of mortal change on earth as when a flock
1	of ravenous fowl though many a league remote 
1	where armies lie encampt come flying lur d
1	with sent of living carcasses design d
1	for death the following day in bloodie fight 
1	so sented the grim feature and upturn d

1	hovering upon the waters what they met
1	solid or slimie as in raging sea

1	from out of chaos to the outside bare
1	of this round world with pinns of adamant

1	of god whom to behold was then my highth
1	of happiness yet well if here would end
1	the miserie i deserv d it and would beare

1	heavie though in thir place o fleeting joyes
1	of paradise deare bought with lasting woes 
1	did i request thee maker from my clay
1	to mould me man did i sollicite thee
1	from darkness to promote me or here place
1	in this delicious garden as my will
1	concurd not to my being it were but right
1	and equal to reduce me to my dust 
1	desirous to resigne and render back
1	all i receav d unable to performe
1	thy terms too hard by which i was to hold
1	the good i sought not to the loss of that 
1	sufficient penaltie why hast thou added
1	the sense of endless woes inexplicable
1	thy justice seems yet to say truth too late 
1	i thus contest then should have been refusd
1	those terms whatever when they were propos d 
1	thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good 
1	then cavil the conditions and though god
1	made thee without thy leave what if thy son
1	prove disobedient and reprov d retort 
1	wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not 
1	wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
1	that proud excuse yet him not thy election 
1	but natural necessity begot 
1	god made thee of choice his own and of his own
1	to serve him thy reward was of his grace 
1	thy punishment then justly is at his will 
1	be it so for i submit his doom is fair 
1	that dust i am and shall to dust returne 
1	o welcom hour whenever why delayes
1	his hand to execute what his decree
1	fixd on this day why do i overlive 
1	why am i mockt with death and length nd out
1	to deathless pain how gladly would i meet
1	mortalitie my sentence and be earth
1	insensible how glad would lay me down
1	as in my mothers lap there i should rest
1	and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
1	would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
1	to mee and to my ofspring would torment me
1	with cruel expectation yet one doubt
1	pursues me still least all i cannot die 
1	least that pure breath of life the spirit of man
1	which god inspir d cannot together perish
1	with this corporeal clod then in the grave 
1	or in some other dismal place who knows
1	but i shall die a living death o thought
1	horrid if true yet why it was but breath
1	of life that sinn d what dies but what had life
1	and sin the bodie properly hath neither 
1	all of me then shall die let this appease
1	the doubt since humane reach no further knows 
1	for though the lord of all be infinite 
1	is his wrauth also be it man is not so 
1	but mortal doom d how can he exercise
1	wrath without end on man whom death must end 
1	can he make deathless death that were to make
1	strange contradiction which to god himself
1	impossible is held as argument
1	of weakness not of power will he draw out 
1	for angers sake finite to infinite
1	in punisht man to satisfie his rigour
1	satisfi d never that were to extend
1	his sentence beyond dust and natures law 
1	by which all causes else according still
1	to the reception of thir matter act 
1	not to th extent of thir own spheare but say
1	that death be not one stroak as i suppos d 
1	bereaving sense but endless miserie
1	from this day onward which i feel begun
1	both in me and without me and so last
1	to perpetuitie ay me that fear
1	comes thundring back with dreadful revolution
1	on my defensless head both death and i
1	am found eternal and incorporate both 
1	nor i on my part single in mee all
1	posteritie stands curst fair patrimonie
1	that i must leave ye sons o were i able
1	to waste it all my self and leave ye none 
1	so disinherited how would ye bless
1	me now your curse ah why should all mankind
1	for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn d 
1	if guiltless but from mee what can proceed 
1	but all corrupt both mind and will deprav d 
1	not to do onely but to will the same
1	with me how can they acquitted stand
1	in sight of god him after all disputes
1	forc t i absolve all my evasions vain
1	and reasonings though through mazes lead me still
1	but to my own conviction first and last
1	on mee mee onely as the sourse and spring
1	of all corruption all the blame lights due 
1	so might the wrauth fond wish couldst thou support
1	that burden heavier then the earth to bear 
1	then all the world much heavier though divided
1	with that bad woman thus what thou desir st 
1	and what thou fearst alike destroyes all hope
1	of refuge and concludes thee miserable
1	beyond all past example and future 
1	to satan onely like both crime and doom 
1	o conscience into what abyss of fears
1	and horrors hast thou driv n me out of which
1	i find no way from deep to deeper plung d 
1	thus adam to himself lamented loud
1	through the still night now now as ere man fell 
1	wholsom and cool and mild but with black air
1	accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom 
1	which to his evil conscience represented
1	all things with double terror on the ground
1	outstretcht he lay on the cold ground and oft
1	curs d his creation death as oft accus d
1	the day of his offence why comes not death 
1	said hee with one thrice acceptable stroke
1	to end me shall truth fail to keep her word 
1	justice divine not hast n to be just 
1	but death comes not at call justice divine
1	mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries 
1	vvith other echo farr i taught your shades
1	to answer and resound farr other song 
1	vvhom thus afflicted when sad eve beheld

1	as in our evils and of easier choice 
1	if care of our descent perplex us most 
1	which must be born to certain woe devourd
1	by death at last and miserable it is
1	to be to others cause of misery 
1	our own begotten and of our loines to bring
1	into this cursed world a woful race 
1	that after wretched life must be at last
1	food for so foule a monster in thy power
1	it lies yet ere conception to prevent
1	the race unblest to being yet unbegot 
1	childless thou art childless remaine 
1	so death shall be deceav d his glut and with us two
1	be forc d to satisfie his rav nous maw

1	conversing looking loving to abstain
1	from loves due rites nuptial embraces sweet 
1	and with desire to languish without hope 
1	before the present object languishing
1	with like desire which would be miserie
1	and torment less then none of what we dread 
1	then both our selves and seed at once to free
1	from what we fear for both let us make short 
1	let us seek death or hee not found supply
1	with our own hands his office on our selves 
1	why stand we longer shivering under feares 
1	that shew no end but death and have the power 
1	of many wayes to die the shortest choosing 
1	destruction with destruction to destroy 
1	she ended heer or vehement despaire
1	broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts
1	had entertaind as di d her cheeks with pale 
1	but adam with such counsel nothing sway d 
1	to better hopes his more attentive minde
1	labouring had rais d and thus to eve repli d 
1	eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
1	to argue in thee somthing more sublime
1	and excellent then what thy minde contemnes 
1	but self destruction therefore saught refutes
1	that excellence thought in thee and implies 
1	not thy contempt but anguish and regret
1	for loss of life and pleasure overlov d 
1	or if thou covet death as utmost end
1	of miserie so thinking to evade
1	the penaltie pronounc t doubt not but god
1	hath wiselier arm d his vengeful ire then so
1	to be forestall d much more i fear least death
1	so snatcht will not exempt us from the paine
1	we are by doom to pay rather such acts
1	of contumacie will provoke the highest
1	to make death in us live then let us seek
1	som safer resolution which methinks
1	i have in view calling to minde with heed
1	part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise
1	the serpents head piteous amends unless
1	be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe
1	satan who in the serpent hath contriv d
1	against us this deceit to crush his head
1	would be revenge indeed which will be lost
1	by death brought on our selves or childless days
1	resolv d as thou proposest so our foe
1	shall scape his punishment ordain d and wee
1	instead shall double ours upon our heads 
1	no more be mention d then of violence
1	against our selves and wilful barrenness 
1	that cuts us off from hope and savours onely
1	rancor and pride impatience and despite 
1	reluctance against god and his just yoke
1	laid on our necks remember with what mild
1	and gracious temper he both heard and judg d
1	without wrauth or reviling wee expected
1	immediate dissolution which we thought
1	was meant by death that day when lo to thee

1	and bringing forth soon recompenc t with joy 
1	fruit of thy womb on mee the curse aslope
1	glanc d on the ground with labour i must earne

1	our frailtie can sustain thy tidings bring 
1	departure from this happy place our sweet

1	no more availes then breath against the winde

1	his blessed count nance here i could frequent 
1	with worship place by place where he voutsaf d

1	of lustre from the brook in memorie 
1	or monument to ages and thereon
1	offer sweet smelling gumms fruits and flours

1	no despicable gift surmise not then
1	his presence to these narrow bounds confin d
1	of paradise or eden this had been
1	perhaps thy capital seate from whence had spred

1	of paradise the highest from whose top
1	the hemisphere of earth in cleerest ken
1	stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay 
1	not higher that hill nor wider looking round 
1	whereon for different cause the tempter set

1	his eye might there command wherever stood
1	city of old or modern fame the seat

1	michael from adams eyes the filme remov d
1	vvhich that false fruit that promis d clearer sight
1	had bred then purg d with euphrasie and rue
1	the visual nerve for he had much to see 
1	and from the vvell of life three drops instill d 
1	so deep the power of these ingredients pierc d 
1	eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight 
1	that adam now enforc t to close his eyes 
1	sunk down and all his spirits became intranst

1	soon rais d and his attention thus recall d

1	nor sinn d thy sin yet from that sin derive
1	corruption to bring forth more violent deeds 
1	his eyes he op nd and beheld a field 
1	part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves
1	new reapt the other part sheep walks and foulds 
1	ith midst an altar as the land mark stood
1	rustic of grassie sord thither anon
1	a sweatie reaper from his tillage brought
1	first fruits the green eare and the yellow sheaf 
1	uncull d as came to hand a shepherd next
1	more meek came with the firstlings of his flock
1	choicest and best then sacrificing laid

1	his offring soon propitious fire from heav n
1	consum d with nimble glance and grateful steame 
1	the others not for his was not sincere 
1	whereat hee inlie rag d and as they talk d 
1	smote him into the midriff with a stone
1	that beat out life he fell and deadly pale
1	groand out his soul with gushing bloud effus d 
1	much at that sight was adam in his heart
1	dismai d and thus in haste to th angel cri d 
1	o teacher some great mischief hath befall n
1	to that meek man who well had sacrific d 
1	is pietie thus and pure devotion paid 
1	t whom michael thus hee also mov d repli d 
1	these two are brethren adam and to come
1	out of thy loyns th unjust the just hath slain 
1	for envie that his brothers offering found
1	from heav n acceptance but the bloodie fact
1	will be aveng d and th others faith approv d
1	loose no reward though here thou see him die 
1	rowling in dust and gore to which our sire 
1	alas both for the deed and for the cause 
1	but have i now seen death is this the way
1	i must return to native dust o sight
1	of terrour foul and ugly to behold 
1	horrid to think how horrible to feel 
1	to whom thus michael death thou hast seen
1	in his first shape on man but many shapes
1	of death and many are the wayes that lead
1	to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense
1	more terrible at th entrance then within 
1	some as thou saw st by violent stroke shall die 
1	by fire flood famin by intemperance more
1	in meats and drinks which on the earth shal bring
1	diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
1	before thee shall appear that thou mayst know
1	what miserie th inabstinence of eve
1	shall bring on men immediately a place
1	before his eyes appeard sad noysom dark 
1	a lazar house it seemd wherein were laid
1	numbers of all diseas d all maladies
1	of gastly spasm or racking torture qualmes
1	of heart sick agonie all feavorous kinds 
1	convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs 
1	intestin stone and ulcer colic pangs 
1	dropsies and asthma s and joint racking rheums 
1	dire was the tossing deep the groans despair
1	tended the sick busiest from couch to couch 
1	and over them triumphant death his dart
1	shook but delaid to strike though oft invok t
1	with vows as thir chief good and final hope 
1	sight so deform what heart of rock could long
1	drie ey d behold adam could not but wept 
1	though not of woman born compassion quell d
1	his best of man and gave him up to tears
1	a space till firmer thoughts restraind excess 
1	and scarce recovering words his plaint renew d 
1	o miserable mankind to what fall
1	degraded to what wretched state reserv d 
1	better end heer unborn why is life giv n
1	to be thus wrested from us rather why
1	obtruded on us thus who if we knew
1	what we receive would either not accept
1	life offer d or soon beg to lay it down 
1	glad to be so dismist in peace can thus
1	th image of god in man created once
1	so goodly and erect though faultie since 
1	to such unsightly sufferings be debas t
1	under inhuman pains why should not man 
1	retaining still divine similitude
1	in part from such deformities be free 
1	and for his makers image sake exempt 
1	thir makers image answerd michael then
1	forsook them when themselves they villifi d
1	to serve ungovern d appetite and took
1	his image whom they serv d a brutish vice 
1	inductive mainly to the sin of eve 
1	therefore so abject is thir punishment 
1	disfiguring not gods likeness but thir own 
1	or if his likeness by themselves defac t
1	while they pervert pure natures healthful rules
1	to loathsom sickness worthily since they
1	gods image did not reverence in themselves 
1	i yeild it just said adam and submit 
1	but is there yet no other way besides
1	these painful passages how we may come
1	to death and mix with our connatural dust 
1	there is said michael if thou well observe
1	the rule of not too much by temperance taught
1	in what thou eatst and drinkst seeking from thence
1	due nourishment not gluttonous delight 
1	till many years over thy head return 
1	so maist thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop
1	into thy mothers lap or be with ease
1	gatherd not harshly pluckt for death mature 
1	this is old age but then thou must outlive
1	thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change
1	to witherd weak gray thy senses then
1	obtuse all taste of pleasure must forgoe 
1	to what thou hast and for the aire of youth
1	hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reigne
1	a melancholly damp of cold and dry
1	to waigh thy spirits down and last consume
1	the balme of life to whom our ancestor 
1	henceforth i flie not death nor would prolong
1	life much bent rather how i may be quit
1	fairest and easiest of this combrous charge 
1	which i must keep till my appointed day
1	of rendring up michael to him repli d 
1	nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livst
1	live well how long or short permit to heav n 
1	and now prepare thee for another sight 
1	he lookd and saw a spacious plaine whereon
1	were tents of various hue by some were herds
1	of cattel grazing others whence the sound
1	of instruments that made melodious chime

1	and now what further shall ensue behold 
1	he lookd and saw the ark hull on the floud 
1	which now abated for the clouds were fled

1	the ark no more now flotes but seems on ground
1	fast on the top of som high mountain fixt 
1	and now the tops of hills as rocks appeer 
1	with clamor thence the rapid currents drive
1	towards the retreating sea thir furious tyde

1	the ancient sire descends with all his train 
1	then with uplifted hands and eyes devout 
1	grateful to heav n over his head beholds
1	a dewie cloud and in the cloud a bow
1	conspicuous with three lifted colours gay

1	farr less i now lament for one whole world
1	of wicked sons destroyd then i rejoyce
1	for one man found so perfet and so just 
1	that god voutsafes to raise another world
1	from him and all his anger to forget 
1	but say what mean those colourd streaks in heavn 
1	distended as the brow of god appeas d 
1	or serve they as a flourie verge to binde
1	the fluid skirts of that same watrie cloud 
1	least it again dissolve and showr the earth 
1	to whom th archangel dextrously thou aim st

1	corrupting each thir way yet those remoov d 
1	such grace shall one just man find in his sight

1	seed time and harvest heat and hoary frost
1	shall hold thir course till fire purge all things new

1	obstruct heav n towrs and in derision sets
1	upon thir tongues a various spirit to rase

1	above the clouds will pine his entrails gross 
1	and famish him of breath if not of bread 
1	to whom thus michael justly thou abhorr st
1	that son who on the quiet state of men

1	over free reason god in judgement just
1	subjects him from without to violent lords 
1	who oft as undeservedly enthrall
1	his outward freedom tyrannie must be

1	establisht such delight hath god in men
1	obedient to his will that he voutsafes
1	among them to set up his tabernacle 
1	the holy one with mortal men to dwell 
1	by his prescript a sanctuary is fram d
1	of cedar overlaid with gold therein

1	the heav nly fires over the tent a cloud
1	shall rest by day a fierie gleame by night 
1	save when they journie and at length they come 
1	promisd to abraham and his seed the rest
1	were long to tell how many battels fought 
1	how many kings destroyd and kingdoms won 
1	or how the sun shall in mid heav n stand still
1	a day entire and nights due course adjourne

1	enlightner of my darkness gracious things
1	thou hast reveald those chiefly which concerne

1	his day in whom all nations shall be blest 
1	favour unmerited by me who sought
1	forbidd n knowledge by forbidd n means 
1	this yet i apprehend not why to those
1	among whom god will deigne to dwell on earth
1	so many and so various laws are giv n 
1	so many laws argue so many sins
1	among them how can god with such reside 
1	to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin
1	will reign among them as of thee begot 
1	and therefore was law given them to evince
1	thir natural pravitie by stirring up
1	sin against law to fight that when they see
1	law can discover sin but not remove 
1	save by those shadowie expiations weak 
1	the bloud of bulls and goats they may conclude
1	some bloud more precious must be paid for man 
1	just for unjust that in such righteousness
1	to them by faith imputed they may finde
1	justification towards god and peace
1	of conscience which the law by ceremonies
1	cannot appease nor man the moral part
1	perform and not performing cannot live 
1	so law appears imperfet and but giv n
1	with purpose to resign them in full time
1	up to a better cov nant disciplin d
1	from shadowie types to truth from flesh to spirit 
1	from imposition of strict laws to free
1	acceptance of large grace from servil fear
1	to filial works of law to works of faith

1	provoking god to raise them enemies 
1	from whom as oft he saves them penitent
1	by judges first then under kings of whom

1	men who attend the altar and should most
1	endeavour peace thir strife pollution brings
1	upon the temple it self at last they seise
1	the scepter and regard not davids sons 
1	then loose it to a stranger that the true
1	anointed king messiah might be born
1	barr d of his right yet at his birth a starr
1	unseen before in heav n proclaims him com 
1	and guides the eastern sages who enquire

1	o prophet of glad tidings finisher

1	why our great expectation should be call d
1	the seed of woman virgin mother haile 
1	high in the love of heav n yet from my loynes
1	thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son
1	of god most high so god with man unites 
1	needs must the serpent now his capital bruise
1	expect with mortal paine say where and when
1	thir fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel 
1	to whom thus michael dream not of thir fight 
1	as of a duel or the local wounds
1	of head or heel not therefore joynes the son
1	manhood to god head with more strength to foil
1	thy enemie nor so is overcome
1	satan whose fall from heav n a deadlier bruise 
1	disabl d not to give thee thy deaths wound 
1	which hee who comes thy saviour shall recure 
1	not by destroying satan but his works
1	in thee and in thy seed nor can this be 
1	but by fulfilling that which thou didst want 
1	obedience to the law of god impos d
1	on penaltie of death and suffering death 
1	the penaltie to thy transgression due 
1	and due to theirs which out of thine will grow 
1	so onely can high justice rest appaid 
1	the law of god exact he shall fulfill

1	alone fulfill the law thy punishment
1	he shall endure by coming in the flesh
1	to a reproachful life and cursed death 
1	proclaiming life to all who shall believe
1	in his redemption and that his obedience
1	imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
1	to save them not thir own though legal works 
1	for this he shall live hated be blasphem d 
1	seis d on by force judg d and to death condemnd
1	a shameful and accurst naild to the cross

1	of all mankinde with him there crucifi d 
1	never to hurt them more who rightly trust
1	in this his satisfaction so he dies 
1	but soon revives death over him no power
1	shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
1	returne the starres of morn shall see him rise
1	out of his grave fresh as the dawning light 
1	thy ransom paid which man from death redeems

1	neglect not and the benefit imbrace
1	by faith not void of works this god like act
1	annuls thy doom the death thou shouldst have dy d 
1	in sin for ever lost from life this act
1	shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength
1	defeating sin and death his two maine armes 
1	and fix farr deeper in his head thir stings
1	then temporal death shall bruise the victors heel 
1	or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep 
1	a gentle wafting to immortal life 
1	nor after resurrection shall he stay
1	longer on earth then certaine times to appeer
1	still follow d him to them shall leave in charge
1	to teach all nations what of him they learn d
1	and his salvation them who shall beleeve
1	baptizing in the profluent streame the signe

1	not onely to the sons of abrahams loines
1	salvation shall be preacht but to the sons
1	of abrahams faith wherever through the world 
1	so in his seed all nations shall be blest 
1	then to the heav n of heav ns he shall ascend
1	with victory triumphing through the aire
1	over his foes and thine there shall surprise
1	the serpent prince of aire and drag in chaines
1	through all his realme there confounded leave 
1	then enter into glory and resume
1	his seat at gods right hand exalted high
1	above all names in heav n and thence shall come

1	to judge th unfaithful dead but to reward
1	his faithful and receave them into bliss 
1	whether in heav n or earth for then the earth
1	shall all be paradise far happier place
1	then this of eden and far happier daies 
1	so spake th archangel michael then paus d 
1	as at the worlds great period and our sire
1	replete with joy and wonder thus repli d 
1	o goodness infinite goodness immense 
1	that all this good of evil shall produce 
1	and evil turn to good more wonderful
1	then that which by creation first brought forth
1	light out of darkness full of doubt i stand 
1	whether i should repent me now of sin
1	by mee done and occasiond or rejoyce
1	much more that much more good thereof shall spring 
1	to god more glory more good will to men
1	from god and over wrauth grace shall abound 
1	but say if our deliverer up to heav n
1	must reascend what will betide the few
1	his faithful left among th unfaithful herd 
1	the enemies of truth who then shall guide
1	his people who defend will they not deale
1	wors with his followers then with him they dealt 
1	be sure they will said th angel but from heav n
1	hee to his own a comforter will send 
1	the promise of the father who shall dwell
1	his spirit within them and the law of faith
1	working through love upon thir hearts shall write 
1	to guide them in all truth and also arme
1	with spiritual armour able to resist
1	satans assaults and quench his fierie darts
1	what man can do against them not affraid 
1	though to the death against such cruelties
1	with inward consolations recompenc t 
1	and oft supported so as shall amaze
1	thir proudest persecuters for the spirit
1	powrd first on his apostles whom he sends
1	to evangelize the nations then on all
1	baptiz d shall them with wondrous gifts endue
1	to speak all tongues and do all miracles 
1	as did thir lord before them thus they win
1	great numbers of each nation to receave
1	with joy the tidings brought from heav n at length
1	thir ministry perform d and race well run 
1	thir doctrine and thir story written left 
1	they die but in thir room as they forewarne 
1	wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves 
1	who all the sacred mysteries of heav n
1	to thir own vile advantages shall turne
1	of lucre and ambition and the truth
1	with superstitions and traditions taint 
1	left onely in those written records pure 
1	though not but by the spirit understood 
1	then shall they seek to avail themselves of names 
1	places and titles and with these to joine
1	secular power though feigning still to act
1	by spiritual to themselves appropriating
1	the spirit of god promisd alike and giv n
1	to all beleevers and from that pretense 
1	spiritual lawes by carnal power shall force
1	on every conscience laws which none shall finde
1	left them inrould or what the spirit within
1	shall on the heart engrave what will they then
1	but force the spirit of grace it self and binde
1	his consort libertie what but unbuild
1	his living temples built by faith to stand 
1	thir own faith not anothers for on earth
1	who against faith and conscience can be heard
1	infallible yet many will presume 
1	whence heavie persecution shall arise
1	on all who in the worship persevere
1	of spirit and truth the rest farr greater part 
1	will deem in outward rites and specious formes
1	religion satisfi d truth shall retire
1	bestuck with slandrous darts and works of faith
1	rarely be found so shall the world goe on 
1	to good malignant to bad men benigne 
1	under her own waight groaning till the day
1	appeer of respiration to the just 
1	and vengeance to the wicked at return
1	of him so lately promis d to thy aid 
1	the womans seed obscurely then foretold 
1	now amplier known thy saviour and thy lord 
1	last in the clouds from heav n to be reveald
1	in glory of the father to dissolve

1	from the conflagrant mass purg d and refin d 
1	new heav ns new earth ages of endless date
1	founded in righteousness and peace and love 
1	to bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss 
1	he ended and thus adam last reply d 
1	how soon hath thy prediction seer blest 
1	measur d this transient world the race of time 
1	till time stand fixt beyond is all abyss 
1	eternitie whose end no eye can reach 
1	greatly instructed i shall hence depart 
1	greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
1	of knowledge what this vessel can containe 
1	beyond which was my folly to aspire 
1	henceforth i learne that to obey is best 
1	and love with feare the onely god to walk
1	as in his presence ever to observe
1	his providence and on him sole depend 
1	merciful over all his works with good
1	still overcoming evil and by small
1	accomplishing great things by things deemd weak
1	subverting worldly strong and worldly wise
1	by simply meek that suffering for truths sake
1	is fortitude to highest victorie 
1	and to the faithful death the gate of life 
1	taught this by his example whom i now
1	acknowledge my redeemer ever blest 
1	to whom thus also th angel last repli d 
1	this having learnt thou hast attaind the summe
1	of wisdom hope no higher though all the starrs
1	thou knewst by name and all th ethereal powers 
1	all secrets of the deep all natures works

1	and all the rule one empire onely add
1	deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith 
1	by name to come call d charitie the soul
1	of all the rest then wilt thou not be loath
1	to leave this paradise but shalt possess
1	a paradise within thee happier farr 
1	let us descend now therefore from this top
1	of speculation for the hour precise
1	exacts our parting hence and see the guards 
1	by mee encampt on yonder hill expect
1	thir motion at whose front a flaming sword 
1	in signal of remove waves fiercely round 
1	we may no longer stay go waken eve 
1	her also i with gentle dreams have calm d
1	portending good and all her spirits compos d
1	to meek submission thou at season fit
1	let her with thee partake what thou hast heard 
1	chiefly what may concern her faith to know 
1	the great deliverance by her seed to come
1	that ye may live which will be many dayes 
1	both in one faith unanimous though sad 
1	with cause for evils past yet much more cheer d
1	with meditation on the happie end 
1	he ended and they both descend the hill 
1	descended adam to the bowre where eve
1	lay sleeping ran before but found her wak t 
1	and thus with words not sad she him receav d 
1	whence thou returnst whither wentst i know 
1	for god is also in sleep and dreams advise 
1	which he hath sent propitious some great good
1	presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress
1	vvearied i fell asleep but now lead on 
1	in mee is no delay with thee to goe 
1	is to stay here without thee here to stay 
1	is to go hence unwilling thou to mee

1	vvho for my wilful crime art banisht hence 
1	this further consolation yet secure
1	i carry hence though all by mee is lost 
1	such favour i unworthie am voutsaft 
1	by mee the promis d seed shall all restore 
1	so spake our mother eve and adam heard
1	vvell pleas d but answer d not for now too nigh
1	th archangel stood and from the other hill
1	to thir fixt station all in bright array
1	the cherubim descended on the ground
1	gliding meteorous as ev ning mist
1	ris n from a river o re the marish glides 
1	and gathers ground fast at the labourers heel
1	homeward returning high in front advanc t 
1	the brandisht sword of god before them blaz d
1	fierce as a comet which with torrid heat 
1	and vapour as the libyan air adust 
1	began to parch that temperate clime whereat
1	in either hand the hastning angel caught
1	our lingring parents and to th eastern gate
1	let them direct and down the cliff as fast
1	to the subjected plaine then disappeer d 
1	they looking back all th eastern side beheld
1	of paradise so late thir happie seat 
1	wav d over by that flaming brand the gate
1	with dreadful faces throng d and fierie armes 
1	som natural tears they drop d but wip d them soon 
1	the world was all before them where to choose
1	thir place of rest and providence thir guide 
1	they hand in hand with wandring steps and slow 
1	through eden took thir solitarie way 
1	and hence the morning planet guilds his horns 
1	when i beheld the poet blind yet bold 
1	in slender book his vast design unfold 
1	messiah crown d gods reconcil d decree 
1	heav n hell earth chaos all the argument
1	held me a while misdoubting his intent 
1	that he would ruine for i saw him strong 
1	the sacred truths to fable and old song
1	 so sampson groap d the temples posts in spight 
1	the world o rewhelming to revenge his sight 
1	yet as i read soon growing less severe 
1	i lik d his project the success did fear 
1	through that wide field how he his way should find
1	o re which lame faith leads understanding blind 
1	lest he perplex d the things he would explain 
1	and what was easie he should render vain 
1	or if a work so infinite he spann d 
1	jealous i was that some less skilful hand
1	 such as disquiet always what is well 
1	and by ill imitating would excell 
1	might hence presume the whole creations day
1	to change in scenes and show it in a play 
1	pardon me mighty poet nor despise
1	my causeless yet not impious surmise 
1	but i am now convinc d and none will dare
1	within thy labours to pretend a share 
1	thou hast not miss d one thought that could be fit 
1	and all that was improper dost omit 
1	so that no room is here for writers left 
1	but to detect their ignorance or theft 
1	that majesty which through thy work doth reign
1	draws the devout deterring the profane 
1	and things divine thou treatst of in such state

1	and above humane flight dost soar aloft
1	with plume so strong so equal and so soft 
1	the bird nam d from that paradise you sing
1	so never flaggs but always keeps on wing 
1	where couldst thou words of such a compass find 
1	whence furnish such a vast expence of mind 
1	just heav n thee like tiresias to requite
1	rewards with prophesie thy loss of sight 
1	well mightst thou scorn thy readers to allure
1	with tinkling rhime of thy own sense secure 
1	while the town bayes writes all the while and spells 
1	and like a pack horse tires without his bells 
1	their fancies like our bushy points appear 
1	the poets tag them we for fashion wear

1	with loss of eden till one greater man
1	restore us and regain the blissful seat 
1	sing heav nly muse that on the secret top

1	and chiefly thou o spirit that dost prefer

1	nine times the space that measures day and night

1	mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate 
1	at once as far as angels kenn he views

1	such place eternal justice had prepar d

1	in utter darkness and their portion set
1	as far remov d from god and light of heav n

1	vaunting aloud but rackt with deep despare 
1	and him thus answer d soon his bold compeer 
1	o prince o chief of many throned powers 
1	that led th imbattelld seraphim to warr
1	under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds
1	fearless endanger d heav ns perpetual king 
1	and put to proof his high supremacy 
1	whether upheld by strength or chance or fate 
1	too well i see and rue the dire event 
1	that with sad overthrow and foul defeat
1	hath lost us heav n and all this mighty host
1	in horrible destruction laid thus low 
1	as far as gods and heav nly essences
1	can perish for the mind and spirit remains
1	invincible and vigour soon returns 
1	though all our glory extinct and happy state
1	here swallow d up in endless misery 
1	but what if he our conquerour whom i now
1	of force believe almighty since no less
1	then such could hav orepow rd such force as ours 
1	have left us this our spirit and strength intire
1	strongly to suffer and support our pains 
1	that we may so suffice his vengeful ire 
1	or do him mightier service as his thralls
1	by right of warr what e re his business be
1	here in the heart of hell to work in fire 
1	or do his errands in the gloomy deep 
1	what can it then avail though yet we feel
1	strength undiminisht or eternal being
1	to undergo eternal punishment 
1	whereto with speedy words th arch fiend reply d 
1	fall n cherube to be weak is miserable
1	doing or suffering but of this be sure 
1	to do ought good never will be our task 
1	but ever to do ill our sole delight 
1	as being the contrary to his high will
1	whom we resist if then his providence
1	out of our evil seek to bring forth good 
1	our labour must be to pervert that end 
1	and out of good still to find means of evil 
1	which oft times may succeed so as perhaps
1	shall grieve him if i fail not and disturb
1	his inmost counsels from their destind aim 
1	but see the angry victor hath recall d
1	his ministers of vengeance and pursuit
1	back to the gates of heav n the sulphurous hail
1	shot after us in storm oreblown hath laid
1	the fiery surge that from the precipice
1	of heav n receiv d us falling and the thunder 
1	wing d with red lightning and impetuous rage 
1	perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now
1	to bellow through the vast and boundless deep 
1	let us not slip th occasion whether scorn

1	seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wilde 
1	the seat of desolation voyd of light 
1	save what the glimmering of these livid flames

1	from off the tossing of these fiery waves 
1	there rest if any rest can harbour there 
1	and reassembling our afflicted powers 
1	consult how we may henceforth most offend
1	our enemy our own loss how repair 
1	how overcome this dire calamity 
1	what reinforcement we may gain from hope

1	thus satan talking to his neerest mate
1	with head up lift above the wave and eyes
1	that sparkling blaz d his other parts besides
1	prone on the flood extended long and large
1	lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge

1	so stretcht out huge in length the arch fiend lay

1	had ris n or heav d his head but that the will
1	and high permission of all ruling heaven
1	left him at large to his own dark designs 
1	that with reiterated crimes he might
1	heap on himself damnation while he sought
1	evil to others and enrag d might see
1	how all his malice serv d but to bring forth
1	infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn

1	we shall be free th almighty hath not built
1	here for his envy will not drive us hence 
1	here we may reign secure and in my choyce
1	to reign is worth ambition though in hell 
1	better to reign in hell then serve in heav n

1	millions that stand in arms and longing wait
1	the signal to ascend sit lingring here
1	heav ns fugitives and for thir dwelling place
1	accept this dark opprobrious den of shame 
1	by our delay no let us rather choose
1	arm d with hell flames and fury all at once
1	o re heav ns high towrs to force resistless way 
1	turning our tortures into horrid arms
1	against the torturer when to meet the noise
1	of his almighty engin he shall hear
1	black fire and horror shot with equal rage
1	among his angels and his throne it self
1	mixt with tartarean sulphur and strange fire 
1	his own invented torments but perhaps
1	the way seems difficult and steep to scale
1	with upright wing against a higher foe 
1	let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
1	of that forgetful lake benumme not still 
1	that in our proper motion we ascend
1	up to our native seat descent and fall
1	to us is adverse who but felt of late
1	when the fierce foe hung on our brok n rear
1	insulting and pursu d us through the deep 
1	with what compulsion and laborious flight
1	we sunk thus low th ascent is easie then 
1	th event is fear d should we again provoke
1	our stronger some worse way his wrath may find
1	to our destruction if there be in hell
1	fear to be worse destroy d what can be worse
1	then to dwell here driv n out from bliss condemn d
1	in this abhorred deep to utter woe 
1	where pain of unextinguishable fire
1	must exercise us without hope of end
1	the vassals of his anger when the scourge
1	inexorably and the torturing houre
1	calls us to penance more destroy d then thus
1	we should be quite abolisht and expire 
1	what fear we then what doubt we to incense
1	his utmost ire which to the highth enrag d 
1	will either quite consume us and reduce
1	to nothing this essential happier farr
1	then miserable to have eternal being 
1	or if our substance be indeed divine 
1	and cannot cease to be we are at worst
1	on this side nothing and by proof we feel
1	our power sufficient to disturb his heav n 
1	and with perpetual inrodes to allarme 
1	though inaccessible his fatal throne 
1	he ended frowning and his look denounc d
1	desperate revenge and battel dangerous
1	to less then gods on th other side up rose
1	belial in act more graceful and humane 
1	a fairer person lost not heav n he seemd
1	for dignity compos d and high exploit 
1	but all was false and hollow though his tongue
1	dropt manna and could make the worse appear
1	the better reason to perplex and dash
1	maturest counsels for his thoughts were low 
1	to vice industrious but to nobler deeds
1	timorous and slothful yet he pleas d the eare 
1	and with perswasive accent thus began 
1	i should be much for open warr o peers 
1	as not behind in hate if what was urg d
1	main reason to perswade immediate warr 
1	did not disswade me most and seem to cast
1	ominous conjecture on the whole success 
1	when he who most excels in fact of arms 
1	in what he counsels and in what excels
1	mistrustful grounds his courage on despair
1	and utter dissolution as the scope
1	of all his aim after some dire revenge 
1	first what revenge the towrs of heav n are fill d
1	with armed watch that render all access
1	impregnable oft on the bordering deep
1	encamp thir legions or with obscure wing
1	scout farr and wide into the realm of night 
1	scorning surprize or could we break our way
1	by force and at our heels all hell should rise
1	with blackest insurrection to confound
1	heav ns purest light yet our great enemie
1	all incorruptible would on his throne
1	sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould
1	incapable of stain would soon expel
1	her mischief and purge off the baser fire
1	victorious thus repuls d our final hope
1	is flat despair we must exasperate
1	th almighty victor to spend all his rage 
1	and that must end us that must be our cure 
1	to be no more sad cure for who would loose 
1	though full of pain this intellectual being 
1	those thoughts that wander through eternity 
1	to perish rather swallowd up and lost
1	in the wide womb of uncreated night 
1	devoid of sense and motion and who knows 
1	let this be good whether our angry foe
1	can give it or will ever how he can
1	is doubtful that he never will is sure 
1	will he so wise let loose at once his ire 
1	belike through impotence or unaware 
1	to give his enemies thir wish and end
1	them in his anger whom his anger saves
1	to punish endless wherefore cease we then 
1	say they who counsel warr we are decreed 
1	reserv d and destin d to eternal woe 
1	whatever doing what can we suffer more 
1	what can we suffer worse is this then worst 
1	thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms 
1	what when we fled amain pursu d and strook
1	with heav ns afflicting thunder and besought
1	the deep to shelter us this hell then seem d
1	a refuge from those wounds or when we lay
1	chain d on the burning lake that sure was worse 
1	what if the breath that kindl d those grim fires
1	awak d should blow them into sevenfold rage
1	and plunge us in the flames or from above
1	should intermitted vengeance arme again
1	his red right hand to plague us what if all
1	her stores were op n d and this firmament
1	of hell should spout her cataracts of fire 
1	impendent horrors threatning hideous fall
1	one day upon our heads while we perhaps
1	designing or exhorting glorious warr 
1	caught in a fierie tempest shall be hurl d
1	each on his rock transfixt the sport and prey
1	of racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk
1	under yon boyling ocean wrapt in chains 
1	there to converse with everlasting groans 
1	unrespited unpitied unrepreevd 
1	ages of hopeless end this would be worse 
1	warr therefore open or conceal d alike
1	my voice disswades for what can force or guile
1	with him or who deceive his mind whose eye
1	views all things at one view he from heav ns highth
1	all these our motions vain sees and derides 
1	not more almighty to resist our might
1	then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles 
1	shall we then live thus vile the race of heav n
1	thus trampl d thus expell d to suffer here
1	chains and these torments better these then worse
1	by my advice since fate inevitable
1	the victors will to suffer as to doe 
1	our strength is equal nor the law unjust
1	that so ordains this was at first resolv d 
1	if we were wise against so great a foe
1	contending and so doubtful what might fall 
1	i laugh when those who at the spear are bold
1	and vent rous if that fail them shrink and fear
1	what yet they know must follow to endure
1	exile or ignominy or bonds or pain 
1	the sentence of thir conquerour this is now
1	our doom which if we can sustain and bear 
1	our supream foe in time may much remit
1	his anger and perhaps thus farr remov d
1	not mind us not offending satisfi d
1	with what is punish t whence these raging fires
1	will slack n if his breath stir not thir flames 
1	our purer essence then will overcome
1	thir noxious vapour or enur d not feel 
1	or chang d at length and to the place conformd
1	in temper and in nature will receive
1	familiar the fierce heat and void of pain 
1	this horror will grow milde this darkness light 
1	besides what hope the never ending flight
1	of future days may bring what chance what change
1	worth waiting since our present lot appeers
1	for happy though but ill for ill not worst 
1	if we procure not to our selves more woe 
1	thus belial with words cloath d in reasons garb
1	counsel d ignoble ease and peaceful sloath 
1	not peace and after him thus mammon spake 
1	either to disinthrone the king of heav n
1	we warr if warr be best or to regain
1	our own right lost him to unthrone we then
1	may hope when everlasting fate shall yeild
1	to fickle chance and chaos judge the strife 
1	the former vain to hope argues as vain
1	the latter for what place can be for us
1	within heav ns bound unless heav ns lord supream
1	we overpower suppose he should relent
1	and publish grace to all on promise made
1	of new subjection with what eyes could we
1	stand in his presence humble and receive
1	strict laws impos d to celebrate his throne
1	with warbl d hymns and to his godhead sing
1	forc t halleluiah s while he lordly sits
1	our envied sovran and his altar breathes
1	our servile offerings this must be our task
1	in heav n this our delight how wearisom
1	eternity so spent in worship paid
1	to whom we hate let us not then pursue
1	by force impossible by leave obtain d
1	unacceptable though in heav n our state
1	of splendid vassalage but rather seek
1	our own good from our selves and from our own
1	live to our selves though in this vast recess 
1	free and to none accountable preferring
1	hard liberty before the easie yoke
1	of servile pomp our greatness will appear
1	then most conspicuous when great things of small 
1	useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse
1	we can create and in what place so e re
1	thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
1	through labour and endurance this deep world
1	of darkness do we dread how oft amidst
1	thick clouds and dark doth heav ns all ruling sire
1	choose to reside his glory unobscur d 
1	and with the majesty of darkness round
1	covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar
1	must ring thir rage and heav n resembles hell 
1	as he our darkness cannot we his light
1	imitate when we please this desart soile
1	wants not her hidden lustre gemms and gold 
1	nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
1	magnificence and what can heav n shew more 
1	our torments also may in length of time
1	become our elements these piercing fires
1	as soft as now severe our temper chang d
1	into their temper which must needs remove
1	the sensible of pain all things invite
1	to peaceful counsels and the settl d state
1	of order how in safety best we may
1	compose our present evils with regard
1	of what we are and where dismissing quite

1	he scarce had finisht when such murmur filld

1	had rous d the sea now with hoarse cadence lull
1	sea faring men orewatcht whose bark by chance
1	or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
1	after the tempest such applause was heard
1	as mammon ended and his sentence pleas d 
1	advising peace for such another field
1	they dreaded worse then hell so much the fear
1	wrought still within them and no less desire
1	to found this nether empire which might rise
1	by pollicy and long process of time 
1	in emulation opposite to heav n 
1	which when beelzebub perceiv d then whom

1	a pillar of state deep on his front engraven

1	and princely counsel in his face yet shon 
1	majestick though in ruin sage he stood
1	with atlantean shoulders fit to bear
1	the weight of mightiest monarchies his look
1	drew audience and attention still as night
1	or summers noon tide air while thus he spake 
1	thrones and imperial powers off spring of heav n 
1	ethereal vertues or these titles now
1	must we renounce and changing stile be call d
1	princes of hell for so the popular vote
1	inclines here to continue and build up here
1	a growing empire doubtless while we dream 
1	and know not that the king of heav n hath doom d
1	this place our dungeon not our safe retreat
1	beyond his potent arm to live exempt
1	from heav ns high jurisdiction in new league
1	banded against his throne but to remaine
1	in strictest bondage though thus far remov d 
1	under th inevitable curb reserv d
1	his captive multitude for he be sure 
1	in highth or depth still first and last will reign
1	sole king and of his kingdom loose no part
1	by our revolt but over hell extend
1	his empire and with iron scepter rule
1	us here as with his golden those in heav n 
1	what sit we then projecting peace and warr 
1	warr hath determin d us and foild with loss
1	irreparable tearms of peace yet none
1	voutsaf t or sought for what peace will be giv n
1	to us enslav d but custody severe

1	inflicted and what peace can we return 
1	but to our power hostility and hate 
1	untam d reluctance and revenge though slow 
1	yet ever plotting how the conquerour least
1	may reap his conquest and may least rejoyce
1	in doing what we most in suffering feel 
1	nor will occasion want nor shall we need
1	with dangerous expedition to invade
1	heav n whose high walls fear no assault or siege 
1	or ambush from the deep what if we find

1	 if ancient and prophetic fame in heav n

1	som advantagious act may be achiev d
1	by sudden onset either with hell fire
1	to waste his whole creation or possess

1	the punie habitants or if not drive 
1	seduce them to our party that thir god

1	in his disturbance when his darling sons
1	hurl d headlong to partake with us shall curse
1	thir frail originals and faded bliss 
1	faded so soon advise if this be worth
1	attempting or to sit in darkness here
1	hatching vain empires thus beelzebub
1	pleaded his devilish counsel first devis d

1	but from the author of all ill could spring
1	so deep a malice to confound the race
1	of mankind in one root and earth with hell

1	his glory to augment the bold design
1	pleas d highly those infernal states and joy
1	sparkl d in all thir eyes with full assent

1	well have ye judg d well ended long debate

1	re enter heav n or else in some milde zone
1	dwell not unvisited of heav ns fair light
1	secure and at the brightning orient beam
1	purge off this gloom the soft delicious air 
1	to heal the scarr of these corrosive fires
1	shall breath her balme but first whom shall we send
1	in search of this new world whom shall we find
1	sufficient who shall tempt with wandring feet
1	the dark unbottom d infinite abyss
1	and through the palpable obscure find out
1	his uncouth way or spread his aerie flight
1	upborn with indefatigable wings
1	over the vast abrupt ere he arrive
1	the happy ile what strength what art can then
1	suffice or what evasion bear him safe
1	through the strict senteries and stations thick
1	of angels watching round here he had need

1	astonisht none among the choice and prime
1	of those heav n warring champions could be found
1	so hardie as to proffer or accept

1	to gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids
1	on hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
1	of ganges or hydaspes indian streams

1	his travell d steps farr distant hee descries
1	ascending by degrees magnificent
1	up to the wall of heaven a structure high 
1	at top whereof but farr more rich appeerd
1	the work as of a kingly palace gate
1	imbellisht thick with sparkling orient gemmes
1	the portal shon inimitable on earth
1	by model or by shading pencil drawn 
1	the stairs were such as whereon jacob saw
1	angels ascending and descending bands
1	of guardians bright when he from esau fled
1	to padan aram in the field of luz 
1	dreaming by night under the open skie 
1	and waking cri d this is the gate of heav n 
1	each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
1	there alwaies but drawn up to heav n somtimes
1	viewless and underneath a bright sea flow d
1	of jasper or of liquid pearle whereon
1	who after came from earth sayling arriv d 
1	wafted by angels or flew o re the lake
1	rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds 
1	the stairs were then let down whether to dare
1	the fiend by easie ascent or aggravate
1	his sad exclusion from the dores of bliss 
1	direct against which op nd from beneath 
1	just o re the blissful seat of paradise 
1	a passage down to th earth a passage wide 
1	wider by farr then that of after times
1	over mount sion and though that were large 
1	over the promis d land to god so dear 
1	by which to visit oft those happy tribes 
1	on high behests his angels to and fro
1	pass d frequent and his eye with choice regard
1	from paneas the fount of jordans flood
1	to beersaba where the holy land
1	so wide the op ning seemd where bounds were set
1	to darkness such as bound the ocean wave 
1	satan from hence now on the lower stair
1	that scal d by steps of gold to heav n gate
1	looks down with wonder at the sudden view
1	of all this world at once as when a scout
1	through dark and desart wayes with peril gone
1	all night at last by break of chearful dawne
1	obtains the brow of some high climbing hill 
1	which to his eye discovers unaware
1	the goodly prospect of some forein land
1	first seen or some renownd metropolis
1	with glistering spires and pinnacles adornd 
1	which now the rising sun guilds with his beams 
1	such wonder seis d though after heaven seen 
1	the spirit maligne but much more envy seis d
1	at sight of all this world beheld so faire

1	so high above the circling canopie
1	of nights extended shade from eastern point
1	of libra to the fleecie starr that bears
1	andromeda farr off atlantick seas
1	beyond th horizon then from pole to pole
1	he views in bredth and without longer pause
1	down right into the worlds first region throws
1	his flight precipitant and windes with ease
1	through the pure marble air his oblique way
1	amongst innumerable starrs that shon
1	stars distant but nigh hand seemd other worlds 
1	or other worlds they seemd or happy iles 
1	like those hesperian gardens fam d of old

1	he stayd not to enquire above them all
1	the golden sun in splendor likest heaven
1	allur d his eye thither his course he bends
1	through the calm firmament but up or downe
1	by center or eccentric hard to tell 
1	or longitude where the great luminarie
1	alooff the vulgar constellations thick 
1	that from his lordly eye keep distance due 
1	dispenses light from farr they as they move
1	thir starry dance in numbers that compute
1	days months and years towards his all chearing lamp
1	turn swift their various motions or are turnd

1	with gentle penetration though unseen

1	the place he found beyond expression bright 
1	compar d with aught on earth medal or stone

1	in vain though by thir powerful art they binde

1	breathe forth elixir pure and rivers run
1	potable gold when with one vertuous touch

1	here in the dark so many precious things
1	of colour glorious and effect so rare 
1	here matter new to gaze the devil met
1	undazl d farr and wide his eye commands 
1	for sight no obstacle found here nor shade 
1	but all sun shine as when his beams at noon
1	culminate from th aequator as they now
1	shot upward still direct whence no way round
1	shadow from body opaque can fall and the aire 
1	no where so cleer sharp nd his visual ray
1	to objects distant farr whereby he soon
1	saw within kenn a glorious angel stand 
1	the same whom john saw also in the sun 
1	his back was turnd but not his brightness hid 
1	of beaming sunnie raies a golden tiar

1	glad was the spirit impure as now in hope
1	to find who might direct his wandring flight
1	to paradise the happie seat of man 
1	his journies end and our beginning woe 
1	but first he casts to change his proper shape 
1	which else might work him danger or delay 
1	and now a stripling cherube he appeers 
1	not of the prime yet such as in his face
1	youth smil d celestial and to every limb
1	sutable grace diffus d so well he feignd 
1	under a coronet his flowing haire
1	in curles on either cheek plaid wings he wore
1	of many a colourd plume sprinkl d with gold

1	he drew not nigh unheard the angel bright 
1	ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turnd

1	th arch angel uriel one of the seav n

1	created this new happie race of men

1	contented with report heare onely in heav n

1	pleasant to know and worthiest to be all
1	had in remembrance alwayes with delight 
1	but what created mind can comprehend
1	thir number or the wisdom infinite
1	that brought them forth but hid thir causes deep 
1	i saw when at his word the formless mass 
1	this worlds material mould came to a heap 
1	confusion heard his voice and wilde uproar

1	flew upward spirited with various forms

1	numberless as thou seest and how they move 
1	each had his place appointed each his course 
1	the rest in circuit walles this universe

1	that place is earth the seat of man that light

1	and in her pale dominion checks the night 
1	that spot to which i point is paradise 
1	adams abode those loftie shades his bowre 
1	thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires 
1	thus said he turnd and satan bowing low 
1	as to superior spirits is wont in heaven 
1	where honour due and reverence none neglects 
1	took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath 
1	down from th ecliptic sped with hop d success 
1	throws his steep flight with many an aerie wheele 
1	nor staid till on niphates top he lights 
1	o for that warning voice which he who saw
1	th apocalyps heard cry in heaven aloud 
1	then when the dragon put to second rout 
1	came furious down to be reveng d on men 
1	wo to the inhabitants on earth that now 
1	while time was our first parents had bin warnd
1	the coming of thir secret foe and scap d
1	haply so scap d his mortal snare for now
1	satan now first inflam d with rage came down 
1	the tempter ere th accuser of man kind 
1	to wreck on innocent frail man his loss
1	of that first battel and his flight to hell 
1	yet not rejoycing in his speed though bold 
1	far off and fearless nor with cause to boast 
1	begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth
1	now rowling boiles in his tumultuous brest 
1	and like a devillish engine back recoiles
1	upon himself horror and doubt distract
1	his troubl d thoughts and from the bottom stirr
1	the hell within him for within him hell
1	he brings and round about him nor from hell
1	one step no more then from himself can fly
1	by change of place now conscience wakes despair
1	that slumberd wakes the bitter memorie
1	of what he was what is and what must be
1	worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue 
1	sometimes towards eden which now in his view
1	lay pleasant his grievd look he fixes sad 
1	sometimes towards heav n and the full blazing sun 
1	which now sat high in his meridian towre 
1	then much revolving thus in sighs began 
1	o thou that with surpassing glory crownd 
1	look st from thy sole dominion like the god
1	of this new world at whose sight all the starrs
1	hide thir diminisht heads to thee i call 
1	but with no friendly voice and add thy name
1	o sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams
1	that bring to my remembrance from what state
1	i fell how glorious once above thy spheare 
1	till pride and worse ambition threw me down
1	warring in heav n against heav ns matchless king 
1	ah wherefore he deservd no such return
1	from me whom he created what i was
1	in that bright eminence and with his good
1	upbraided none nor was his service hard 
1	what could be less then to afford him praise 
1	the easiest recompence and pay him thanks 
1	how due yet all his good prov d ill in me 
1	and wrought but malice lifted up so high
1	i sdeind subjection and thought one step higher
1	would set me highest and in a moment quit
1	the debt immense of endless gratitude 
1	so burthensome still paying still to ow 
1	forgetful what from him i still receivd 
1	and understood not that a grateful mind
1	by owing owes not but still pays at once
1	indebted and dischargd what burden then 
1	o had his powerful destiny ordaind
1	me some inferiour angel i had stood
1	then happie no unbounded hope had rais d
1	ambition yet why not som other power
1	as great might have aspir d and me though mean
1	drawn to his part but other powers as great
1	fell not but stand unshak n from within
1	or from without to all temptations arm d 
1	hadst thou the same free will and power to stand 
1	thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse 
1	but heav ns free love dealt equally to all 
1	be then his love accurst since love or hate 
1	to me alike it deals eternal woe 
1	nay curs d be thou since against his thy will
1	chose freely what it now so justly rues 
1	me miserable which way shall i flie
1	infinite wrauth and infinite despaire 
1	which way i flie is hell my self am hell 
1	and in the lowest deep a lower deep
1	still threatning to devour me opens wide 
1	to which the hell i suffer seems a heav n 
1	o then at last relent is there no place
1	left for repentance none for pardon left 
1	none left but by submission and that word
1	disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
1	among the spirits beneath whom i seduc d
1	with other promises and other vaunts
1	then to submit boasting i could subdue
1	th omnipotent ay me they little know
1	how dearly i abide that boast so vaine 
1	under what torments inwardly i groane 
1	while they adore me on the throne of hell 
1	with diadem and scepter high advanc d
1	the lower still i fall onely supream
1	in miserie such joy ambition findes 
1	but say i could repent and could obtaine
1	by act of grace my former state how soon
1	would highth recal high thoughts how soon unsay
1	what feign d submission swore ease would recant
1	vows made in pain as violent and void 
1	for never can true reconcilement grow
1	where wounds of deadly hate have peirc d so deep 
1	which would but lead me to a worse relapse
1	and heavier fall so should i purchase deare
1	short intermission bought with double smart 
1	this knows my punisher therefore as farr
1	from granting hee as i from begging peace 
1	all hope excluded thus behold in stead
1	of us out cast exil d his new delight 
1	mankind created and for him this world 
1	so farwel hope and with hope farwel fear 
1	farwel remorse all good to me is lost 
1	evil be thou my good by thee at least
1	divided empire with heav ns king i hold
1	by thee and more then half perhaps will reigne 
1	as man ere long and this new world shall know 
1	thus while he spake each passion dimm d his face
1	thrice chang d with pale ire envie and despair 
1	which marrd his borrow d visage and betraid

1	as he suppos d all unobserv d unseen 
1	so on he fares and to the border comes
1	of eden where delicious paradise 
1	now nearer crowns with her enclosure green 
1	as with a rural mound the champain head
1	of a steep wilderness whose hairie sides
1	with thicket overgrown grottesque and wilde 
1	access deni d and over head up grew
1	insuperable highth of loftiest shade 
1	cedar and pine and firr and branching palm 
1	a silvan scene and as the ranks ascend
1	shade above shade a woodie theatre
1	of stateliest view yet higher then thir tops
1	the verdurous wall of paradise up sprung 
1	which to our general sire gave prospect large
1	into his neather empire neighbouring round 
1	and higher then that wall a circling row
1	of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit 
1	blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue
1	appeerd with gay enameld colours mixt 
1	on which the sun more glad impress d his beams
1	then in fair evening cloud or humid bow 
1	when god hath showrd the earth so lovely seemd
1	that lantskip and of pure now purer aire
1	meets his approach and to the heart inspires
1	vernal delight and joy able to drive
1	all sadness but despair now gentle gales
1	fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense
1	native perfumes and whisper whence they stole
1	those balmie spoiles as when to them who saile
1	beyond the cape of hope and now are past
1	mozambic off at sea north east windes blow
1	sabean odours from the spicie shoare
1	of arabie the blest with such delay
1	well pleas d they slack thir course and many a league
1	cheard with the grateful smell old ocean smiles 
1	so entertaind those odorous sweets the fiend
1	who came thir bane though with them better pleas d
1	then asmodeus with the fishie fume 
1	that drove him though enamourd from the spouse
1	of tobits son and with a vengeance sent
1	now to th ascent of that steep savage hill
1	satan had journied on pensive and slow 
1	but further way found none so thick entwin d 
1	as one continu d brake the undergrowth
1	of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext
1	all path of man or beast that past that way 
1	one gate there onely was and that look d east
1	on th other side which when th arch fellon saw
1	due entrance he disdaind and in contempt 
1	at one slight bound high overleap d all bound
1	of hill or highest wall and sheer within

1	whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey 
1	watching where shepherds pen thir flocks at eeve
1	in hurdl d cotes amid the field secure 
1	leaps o re the fence with ease into the fould

1	in at the window climbes or o re the tiles 
1	so clomb this first grand thief into gods fould 
1	so since into his church lewd hirelings climbe 
1	thence up he flew and on the tree of life 
1	the middle tree and highest there that grew 
1	sat like a cormorant yet not true life
1	thereby regaind but sat devising death
1	to them who liv d nor on the vertue thought

1	to all delight of human sense expos d
1	in narrow room natures whole wealth yea more 
1	a heaven on earth for blissful paradise
1	of god the garden was by him in the east
1	of eden planted eden stretchd her line
1	of great seleucia built by grecian kings 
1	or where the sons of eden long before
1	dwelt in telassar in this pleasant soile

1	out of the fertil ground he caus d to grow

1	of porous earth with kindly thirst up drawn 
1	rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
1	waterd the garden thence united fell
1	down the steep glade and met the neather flood 
1	which from his darksom passage now appeers 
1	and now divided into four main streams 
1	runs divers wandring many a famous realme
1	and country whereof here needs no account 
1	but rather to tell how if art could tell 
1	how from that saphire fount the crisped brooks 
1	rowling on orient pearl and sands of gold

1	and from whom i was formd flesh of thy flesh 
1	and without whom am to no end my guide
1	and head what thou hast said is just and right 
1	for wee to him indeed all praises owe 
1	and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy
1	so farr the happier lot enjoying thee
1	preeminent by so much odds while thou
1	like consort to thy self canst no where find 
1	that day i oft remember when from sleep
1	i first awak t and found my self repos d
1	under a shade on flours much wondring where
1	and what i was whence thither brought and how 
1	not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
1	of waters issu d from a cave and spread
1	into a liquid plain then stood unmov d
1	pure as th expanse of heav n i thither went
1	with unexperienc t thought and laid me downe
1	on the green bank to look into the cleer
1	smooth lake that to me seemd another skie 
1	as i bent down to look just opposite 
1	a shape within the watry gleam appeerd
1	bending to look on me i started back 
1	it started back but pleasd i soon returnd 
1	pleas d it returnd as soon with answering looks
1	of sympathie and love there i had fixt
1	mine eyes till now and pin d with vain desire 
1	had not a voice thus warnd me what thou seest 
1	what there thou seest fair creature is thy self 
1	with thee it came and goes but follow me 
1	and i will bring thee where no shadow staies
1	thy coming and thy soft imbraces hee
1	whose image thou art him thou shall enjoy
1	inseparablie thine to him shalt beare
1	multitudes like thy self and thence be call d
1	mother of human race what could i doe 
1	but follow strait invisibly thus led 
1	till i espi d thee fair indeed and tall 
1	under a platan yet methought less faire 
1	less winning soft less amiablie milde 
1	then that smooth watry image back i turnd 
1	thou following cryd st aloud return fair eve 
1	whom fli st thou whom thou fli st of him thou art 
1	his flesh his bone to give thee being i lent
1	out of my side to thee neerest my heart
1	substantial life to have thee by my side
1	henceforth an individual solace dear 
1	part of my soul i seek thee and thee claim
1	my other half with that thy gentle hand
1	seisd mine i yeilded and from that time see
1	how beauty is excelld by manly grace
1	and wisdom which alone is truly fair 
1	so spake our general mother and with eyes
1	of conjugal attraction unreprov d 
1	and meek surrender half imbracing leand
1	on our first father half her swelling breast
1	naked met his under the flowing gold
1	of her loose tresses hid he in delight
1	both of her beauty and submissive charms
1	smil d with superior love as jupiter
1	on juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
1	that shed may flowers and press d her matron lip
1	with kisses pure aside the devil turnd
1	for envie yet with jealous leer maligne
1	ey d them askance and to himself thus plaind 
1	sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two
1	imparadis t in one anothers arms
1	the happier eden shall enjoy thir fill
1	of bliss on bliss while i to hell am thrust 
1	where neither joy nor love but fierce desire 
1	among our other torments not the least 
1	still unfulfill d with pain of longing pines 
1	yet let me not forget what i have gain d
1	from thir own mouths all is not theirs it seems 
1	one fatal tree there stands of knowledge call d 
1	forbidden them to taste knowledge forbidd n 
1	suspicious reasonless why should thir lord
1	envie them that can it be sin to know 
1	can it be death and do they onely stand
1	by ignorance is that thir happie state 
1	the proof of thir obedience and thir faith 
1	o fair foundation laid whereon to build
1	thir ruine hence i will excite thir minds
1	with more desire to know and to reject
1	envious commands invented with designe
1	to keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
1	equal with gods aspiring to be such 
1	they taste and die what likelier can ensue 
1	but first with narrow search i must walk round
1	this garden and no corner leave unspi d 
1	a chance but chance may lead where i may meet
1	some wandring spirit of heav n by fountain side 
1	or in thick shade retir d from him to draw
1	what further would be learnt live while ye may 
1	yet happie pair enjoy till i return 
1	short pleasures for long woes are to succeed 
1	so saying his proud step he scornful turn d 
1	but with sly circumspection and began
1	through wood through waste o re hil o re dale his roam 
1	mean while in utmost longitude where heav n
1	with earth and ocean meets the setting sun
1	slowly descended and with right aspect
1	against the eastern gate of paradise
1	leveld his eevning rayes it was a rock
1	of alablaster pil d up to the clouds 
1	conspicuous farr winding with one ascent
1	accessible from earth one entrance high 
1	the rest was craggie cliff that overhung
1	still as it rose impossible to climbe 
1	betwixt these rockie pillars gabriel sat
1	chief of th angelic guards awaiting night 
1	about him exercis d heroic games
1	th unarmed youth of heav n but nigh at hand
1	hung high with diamond flaming and with gold 
1	thither came uriel gliding through the eeven
1	on a sun beam swift as a shooting starr
1	in autumn thwarts the night when vapors fir d
1	impress the air and shews the mariner
1	from what point of his compass to beware
1	impetuous winds he thus began in haste 
1	gabriel to thee thy cours by lot hath giv n
1	charge and strict watch that to this happie place
1	no evil thing approach or enter in 
1	this day at highth of noon came to my spheare
1	a spirit zealous as he seem d to know
1	more of th almighties works and chiefly man
1	gods latest image i describ d his way
1	bent all on speed and markt his aerie gate 
1	but in the mount that lies from eden north 
1	where he first lighted soon discernd his looks
1	alien from heav n with passions foul obscur d 
1	mine eye pursu d him still but under shade
1	lost sight of him one of the banisht crew
1	i fear hath ventur d from the deep to raise
1	new troubles him thy care must be to find 
1	to whom the winged warriour thus returnd 
1	uriel no wonder if thy perfet sight 
1	amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst

1	the vigilance here plac t but such as come
1	well known from heav n and since meridian hour
1	no creature thence if spirit of other sort 
1	so minded have oreleapt these earthie bounds
1	on purpose hard thou knowst it to exclude
1	spiritual substance with corporeal barr 
1	but if within the circuit of these walks
1	in whatsoever shape he lurk of whom
1	thou telst by morrow dawning i shall know 
1	so promis d hee and uriel to his charge
1	returnd on that bright beam whose point now raisd

1	beneath th azores whither the prime orb 
1	incredible how swift had thither rowl d
1	diurnal or this less volubil earth
1	by shorter flight to th east had left him there
1	arraying with reflected purple and gold
1	the clouds that on his western throne attend 
1	now came still eevning on and twilight gray
1	had in her sober liverie all things clad 
1	silence accompanied for beast and bird 
1	they to thir grassie couch these to thir nests
1	were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale 
1	she all night long her amorous descant sung

1	forth issuing at th accustomd hour stood armd
1	to thir night watches in warlike parade 
1	when gabriel to his next in power thus spake 
1	uzziel half these draw off and coast the south
1	with strictest watch these other wheel the north 
1	our circuit meets full west as flame they part
1	half wheeling to the shield half to the spear 
1	from these two strong and suttle spirits he calld
1	that neer him stood and gave them thus in charge 
1	ithuriel and zephon with wingd speed
1	search through this garden leav unsearcht no nook 
1	but chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge 
1	now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme 
1	this eevning from the sun s decline arriv d
1	who tells of som infernal spirit seen
1	hitherward bent who could have thought escap d
1	the barrs of hell on errand bad no doubt 
1	such where ye find seise fast and hither bring 
1	so saying on he led his radiant files 
1	daz ling the moon these to the bower direct
1	in search of whom they sought him there they found
1	squat like a toad close at the eare of eve 
1	assaying by his devilish art to reach
1	the organs of her fancie and with them forge
1	illusions as he list phantasms and dreams 
1	or if inspiring venom he might taint
1	th animal spirits that from pure blood arise
1	like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
1	at least distemperd discontented thoughts 
1	vain hopes vain aimes inordinate desires
1	blown up with high conceits ingendring pride 
1	him thus intent ithuriel with his spear
1	touch d lightly for no falshood can endure
1	touch of celestial temper but returns
1	of force to its own likeness up he starts
1	discoverd and surpriz d as when a spark
1	lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
1	fit for the tun som magazin to store
1	against a rumord warr the smuttie graine
1	with sudden blaze diffus d inflames the aire 
1	so started up in his own shape the fiend 
1	back stept those two fair angels half amaz d
1	so sudden to behold the grieslie king 
1	yet thus unmovd with fear accost him soon 
1	which of those rebell spirits adjudg d to hell
1	com st thou escap d thy prison and transform d 
1	why satst thou like an enemie in waite
1	here watching at the head of these that sleep 
1	know ye not then said satan filld with scorn 
1	know ye not me ye knew me once no mate
1	for you there sitting where ye durst not soare 
1	not to know mee argues your selves unknown 
1	the lowest of your throng or if ye know 
1	why ask ye and superfluous begin
1	your message like to end as much in vain 
1	to whom thus zephon answering scorn with scorn 
1	think not revolted spirit thy shape the same 
1	or undiminisht brightness to be known
1	as when thou stoodst in heav n upright and pure 
1	that glorie then when thou no more wast good 
1	departed from thee and thou resembl st now
1	thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule 
1	but come for thou be sure shalt give account
1	to him who sent us whose charge is to keep
1	this place inviolable and these from harm 
1	so spake the cherube and his grave rebuke
1	severe in youthful beautie added grace
1	invincible abasht the devil stood 
1	and felt how awful goodness is and saw
1	vertue in her shape how lovly saw and pin d
1	his loss but chiefly to find here observd
1	his lustre visibly impar d yet seemd
1	undaunted if i must contend said he 
1	best with the best the sender not the sent 
1	or all at once more glorie will be wonn 
1	or less be lost thy fear said zephon bold 
1	will save us trial what the least can doe
1	single against thee wicked and thence weak 
1	the fiend repli d not overcome with rage 
1	but like a proud steed reind went hautie on 
1	chaumping his iron curb to strive or flie
1	he held it vain awe from above had quelld
1	his heart not else dismai d now drew they nigh
1	the western point where those half rounding guards
1	just met closing stood in squadron joind
1	awaiting next command to whom thir chief
1	gabriel from the front thus calld aloud 
1	o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet
1	hasting this way and now by glimps discerne
1	ithuriel and zephon through the shade 
1	and with them comes a third of regal port 
1	but faded splendor wan who by his gate
1	and fierce demeanour seems the prince of hell 
1	not likely to part hence without contest 
1	stand firm for in his look defiance lours 
1	he scarce had ended when those two approachd
1	and brief related whom they brought wher found 
1	how busied in what form and posture coucht 
1	to whom with stern regard thus gabriel spake 
1	why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescrib d
1	to thy transgressions and disturbd the charge
1	of others who approve not to transgress
1	by thy example but have power and right
1	to question thy bold entrance on this place 
1	imploi d it seems to violate sleep and those
1	whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss 
1	to whom thus satan with contemptuous brow 
1	gabriel thou hadst in heav n th esteem of wise 
1	and such i held thee but this question askt
1	puts me in doubt lives ther who loves his pain 
1	who would not finding way break loose from hell 
1	though thither doomd thou wouldst thy self no doubt 
1	and boldly venture to whatever place
1	farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
1	torment with ease soonest recompence
1	dole with delight which in this place i sought 
1	to thee no reason who knowst only good 
1	but evil hast not tri d and wilt object
1	his will who bound us let him surer barr
1	his iron gates if he intends our stay
1	in that dark durance thus much what was askt 
1	the rest is true they found me where they say 
1	but that implies not violence or harme 
1	thus hee in scorn the warlike angel mov d 
1	disdainfully half smiling thus repli d 
1	o loss of one in heav n to judge of wise 
1	since satan fell whom follie overthrew 
1	and now returns him from his prison scap t 
1	gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
1	or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
1	unlicenc t from his bounds in hell prescrib d 
1	so wise he judges it to fly from pain
1	however and to scape his punishment 
1	so judge thou still presumptuous till the wrauth 
1	which thou incurr st by flying meet thy flight
1	seavenfold and scourge that wisdom back to hell 
1	which taught thee yet no better that no pain
1	can equal anger infinite provok t 
1	but wherefore thou alone wherefore with thee
1	came not all hell broke loose is pain to them
1	less pain less to be fled or thou then they
1	less hardie to endure courageous chief 
1	the first in flight from pain had st thou alleg d
1	to thy deserted host this cause of flight 
1	thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive 
1	to which the fiend thus answerd frowning stern 
1	not that i less endure or shrink from pain 
1	insulting angel well thou knowst i stood
1	thy fiercest when in battel to thy aide
1	the blasting volied thunder made all speed
1	and seconded thy else not dreaded spear 
1	but still thy words at random as before 
1	argue thy inexperience what behooves
1	from hard assaies and ill successes past
1	a faithful leader not to hazard all
1	through wayes of danger by himself untri d 
1	i therefore i alone first undertook
1	to wing the desolate abyss and spie
1	this new created world whereof in hell
1	fame is not silent here in hope to find
1	better abode and my afflicted powers
1	to settle here on earth or in mid aire 
1	though for possession put to try once more
1	what thou and thy gay legions dare against 
1	whose easier business were to serve thir lord
1	high up in heav n with songs to hymne his throne 
1	and practis d distances to cringe not fight 
1	to whom the warriour angel soon repli d 
1	to say and strait unsay pretending first
1	wise to flie pain professing next the spie 
1	argues no leader but a lyar trac t 
1	satan and couldst thou faithful add o name 
1	o sacred name of faithfulness profan d 
1	faithful to whom to thy rebellious crew 
1	armie of fiends fit body to fit head 
1	was this your discipline and faith ingag d 
1	your military obedience to dissolve
1	allegeance to th acknowledg d power supream 
1	and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
1	patron of liberty who more then thou
1	once fawn d and cring d and servilly ador d
1	heav ns awful monarch wherefore but in hope
1	to dispossess him and thy self to reigne 
1	but mark what i arreede thee now avant 
1	flie thither whence thou fledst if from this houre
1	within these hallowd limits thou appeer 
1	back to th infernal pit i drag thee chaind 
1	and seale thee so as henceforth not to scorne
1	the facil gates of hell too slightly barrd 
1	so threatn d hee but satan to no threats
1	gave heed but waxing more in rage repli d 
1	then when i am thy captive talk of chaines 
1	proud limitarie cherube but ere then
1	farr heavier load thy self expect to feel
1	from my prevailing arme though heavens king
1	ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers 
1	us d to the yoak draw st his triumphant wheels
1	in progress through the rode of heav n star pav d 
1	while thus he spake th angelic squadron bright
1	turnd fierie red sharpning in mooned hornes
1	thir phalanx and began to hemm him round
1	with ported spears as thick as when a field
1	of ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
1	her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
1	swayes them the careful plowman doubting stands
1	least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves
1	prove chaff on th other side satan allarm d
1	collecting all his might dilated stood 
1	like teneriff or atlas unremov d 
1	his stature reacht the skie and on his crest
1	sat horror plum d nor wanted in his graspe
1	what seemd both spear and shield now dreadful deeds
1	might have ensu d nor onely paradise
1	in this commotion but the starrie cope
1	of heav n perhaps or all the elements
1	at least had gon to rack disturbd and torne
1	with violence of this conflict had not soon
1	th eternal to prevent such horrid fray
1	hung forth in heav n his golden scales yet seen
1	betwixt astrea and the scorpion signe 
1	wherein all things created first he weighd 
1	the pendulous round earth with ballanc t aire
1	in counterpoise now ponders all events 
1	battels and realms in these he put two weights
1	the sequel each of parting and of fight 
1	the latter quick up flew and kickt the beam 
1	which gabriel spying thus bespake the fiend 
1	satan i know thy strength and thou knowst mine 
1	neither our own but giv n what follie then
1	to boast what arms can doe since thine no more
1	then heav n permits nor mine though doubld now
1	to trample thee as mire for proof look up 
1	and read thy lot in yon celestial sign
1	where thou art weigh d shown how light how weak 
1	if thou resist the fiend lookt up and knew
1	his mounted scale aloft nor more but fled
1	murmuring and with him fled the shades of night 
1	now morn her rosie steps in th eastern clime
1	advancing sow d the earth with orient pearle 
1	when adam wak t so customd for his sleep
1	was aerie light from pure digestion bred 
1	and temperat vapors bland which th only sound
1	of leaves and fuming rills aurora s fan 
1	lightly dispers d and the shrill matin song
1	of birds on every bough so much the more
1	his wonder was to find unwak nd eve
1	with tresses discompos d and glowing cheek 
1	as through unquiet rest he on his side
1	leaning half rais d with looks of cordial love
1	hung over her enamour d and beheld
1	beautie which whether waking or asleep 
1	shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
1	milde as when zephyrus on flora breathes 
1	her hand soft touching whisperd thus awake
1	my fairest my espous d my latest found 
1	heav ns last best gift my ever new delight 
1	awake the morning shines and the fresh field
1	calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
1	our tended plants how blows the citron grove 
1	what drops the myrrhe what the balmie reed 
1	how nature paints her colours how the bee
1	sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet 
1	such whispering wak d her but with startl d eye
1	on adam whom imbracing thus she spake 
1	o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose 
1	my glorie my perfection glad i see
1	thy face and morn return d for i this night 
1	such night till this i never pass d have dream d 
1	if dream d not as i oft am wont of thee 
1	works of day pass t or morrows next designe 
1	but of offence and trouble which my mind
1	knew never till this irksom night methought
1	close at mine ear one call d me forth to walk
1	with gentle voice i thought it thine it said 
1	why sleepst thou eve now is the pleasant time 
1	the cool the silent save where silence yields
1	to the night warbling bird that now awake
1	tunes sweetest his love labor d song now reignes
1	full orb d the moon and with more pleasing light
1	shadowie sets off the face of things in vain 
1	if none regard heav n wakes with all his eyes 
1	whom to behold but thee natures desire 
1	in whose sight all things joy with ravishment
1	attracted by thy beauty still to gaze 
1	i rose as at thy call but found thee not 
1	to find thee i directed then my walk 
1	and on methought alone i pass d through ways
1	that brought me on a sudden to the tree
1	of interdicted knowledge fair it seem d 
1	much fairer to my fancie then by day 
1	and as i wondring lookt beside it stood
1	one shap d and wing d like one of those from heav n
1	by us oft seen his dewie locks distill d
1	ambrosia on that tree he also gaz d 
1	and o fair plant said he with fruit surcharg d 
1	deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet 
1	nor god nor man is knowledge so despis d 
1	or envie or what reserve forbids to taste 
1	forbid who will none shall from me withhold
1	longer thy offerd good why else set here 
1	this said he paus d not but with ventrous arme
1	he pluckt he tasted mee damp horror chil d
1	at such bold words voucht with a deed so bold 
1	but he thus overjoy d o fruit divine 
1	sweet of thy self but much more sweet thus cropt 
1	forbidd n here it seems as onely fit
1	for gods yet able to make gods of men 
1	and why not gods of men since good the more
1	communicated more abundant growes 
1	the author not impair d but honourd more 
1	here happie creature fair angelic eve 
1	partake thou also happie though thou art 
1	happier thou mayst be worthier canst not be 
1	taste this and be henceforth among the gods
1	thy self a goddess not to earth confind 
1	but somtimes in the air as wee somtimes
1	ascend to heav n by merit thine and see
1	what life the gods live there and such live thou 
1	so saying he drew nigh and to me held 
1	even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
1	which he had pluckt the pleasant savourie smell
1	so quick nd appetite that i methought 
1	could not but taste forthwith up to the clouds
1	with him i flew and underneath beheld
1	the earth outstretcht immense a prospect wide
1	and various wondring at my flight and change
1	to this high exaltation suddenly
1	my guide was gon and i me thought sunk down 
1	and fell asleep but o how glad i wak d
1	to find this but a dream thus eve her night
1	related and thus adam answerd sad 
1	best image of my self and dearer half 
1	the trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
1	affects me equally nor can i like
1	this uncouth dream of evil sprung i fear 
1	yet evil whence in thee can harbour none 
1	created pure but know that in the soule
1	are many lesser faculties that serve
1	reason as chief among these fansie next
1	her office holds of all external things 
1	which the five watchful senses represent 
1	she forms imaginations aerie shapes 
1	which reason joyning or disjoyning frames
1	all what we affirm or what deny and call
1	our knowledge or opinion then retires
1	into her private cell when nature rests 
1	oft in her absence mimic fansie wakes
1	to imitate her but misjoyning shapes 
1	wilde work produces oft and most in dreams 
1	ill matching words and deeds long past or late 
1	som such resemblances methinks i find
1	of our last eevnings talk in this thy dream 
1	but with addition strange yet be not sad 
1	evil into the mind of god or man
1	may come and go so unapprov d and leave
1	no spot or blame behind which gives me hope
1	that what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream 
1	waking thou never wilt consent to do 
1	be not disheart nd then nor cloud those looks
1	that wont to be more chearful and serene
1	then when fair morning first smiles on the world 
1	and let us to our fresh imployments rise
1	that open now thir choicest bosom d smells
1	reservd from night and kept for thee in store 
1	so cheard he his fair spouse and she was cheard 
1	but silently a gentle tear let fall
1	from either eye and wip d them with her haire 
1	two other precious drops that ready stood 
1	each in thir chrystal sluce hee ere they fell
1	kiss d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
1	and pious awe that feard to have offended 
1	so all was cleard and to the field they haste 
1	but first from under shadie arborous roof 
1	soon as they forth were come to open sight
1	of day spring and the sun who scarce up risen

1	of paradise and edens happie plains 
1	lowly they bow d adoring and began

1	of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears 
1	if these magnific titles yet remain
1	not meerly titular since by decree

1	will ye submit your necks and chuse to bend

1	with regal scepter every soule in heav n
1	shall bend the knee and in that honour due
1	confess him rightful king unjust thou saist

1	shalt thou give law to god shalt thou dispute

1	grateful vicissitude like day and night 
1	light issues forth and at the other dore
1	obsequious darkness enters till her houre
1	to veile the heav n though darkness there might well
1	seem twilight here and now went forth the morn
1	such as in highest heav n arrayd in gold
1	empyreal from before her vanisht night 
1	shot through with orient beams when all the plain

1	reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view

1	returnd not lost on to the sacred hill
1	they led him high applauded and present

1	servant of god well done well hast thou fought

1	against revolted multitudes the cause

1	and in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet
1	so oft in festivals of joy and love
1	unanimous as sons of one great sire
1	hymning th eternal father but the shout
1	of battel now began and rushing sound
1	of onset ended soon each milder thought

1	should yet remain where faith and realtie
1	remain not wherfore should not strength might
1	there fail where vertue fails or weakest prove
1	where boldest though to sight unconquerable 
1	his puissance trusting in th almightie s aide 
1	i mean to try whose reason i have tri d
1	unsound and false nor is it aught but just 
1	that he who in debate of truth hath won 
1	should win in arms in both disputes alike
1	victor though brutish that contest and foule 
1	when reason hath to deal with force yet so
1	most reason is that reason overcome 
1	so pondering and from his armed peers
1	forth stepping opposite half way he met
1	his daring foe at this prevention more
1	incens t and thus securely him defi d 
1	proud art thou met thy hope was to have reacht
1	the highth of thy aspiring unoppos d 
1	the throne of god unguarded and his side

1	to god or thee because we have a foe
1	may tempt it i expected not to hear 
1	his violence thou fearst not being such

1	his fraud is then thy fear which plain inferrs

1	the tempted with dishonour foul suppos d
1	not incorruptible of faith not prooff
1	against temptation thou thy self with scorne
1	and anger wouldst resent the offer d wrong 
1	though ineffectual found misdeem not then

1	from thee alone which on us both at once
1	the enemie though bold will hardly dare 
1	or daring first on mee th assault shall light

1	more wise more watchful stronger if need were

1	would utmost vigor raise and rais d unite 
1	why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
1	when i am present and thy trial choose
1	with me best witness of thy vertue tri d 
1	so spake domestick adam in his care

1	less attributed to her faith sincere 
1	thus her reply with accent sweet renewd 
1	if this be our condition thus to dwell
1	in narrow circuit strait nd by a foe 
1	suttle or violent we not endu d
1	single with like defence wherever met 
1	how are we happie still in fear of harm 
1	but harm precedes not sin onely our foe
1	tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
1	of our integritie his foul esteeme
1	sticks no dishonor on our front but turns
1	foul on himself then wherfore shund or feard
1	by us who rather double honour gaine
1	from his surmise prov d false finde peace within

1	secure from outward force within himself
1	the danger lies yet lies within his power 
1	against his will he can receave no harme

1	i turnd my thoughts and with capacious mind
1	considerd all things visible in heav n

1	serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt
1	the vertue of that fruit in thee first prov d 
1	but say where grows the tree from hence how far 
1	for many are the trees of god that grow
1	in paradise and various yet unknown
1	to us in such abundance lies our choice 
1	as leaves a greater store of fruit untoucht 
1	still hanging incorruptible till men
1	grow up to thir provision and more hands

1	led eve our credulous mother to the tree

1	fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess 
1	the credit of whose vertue rest with thee 
1	wondrous indeed if cause of such effects

1	god so commanded and left that command
1	sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
1	law to our selves our reason is our law 
1	to whom the tempter guilefully repli d 
1	indeed hath god then said that of the fruit
1	of all these garden trees ye shall not eate 
1	yet lords declar d of all in earth or aire 
1	to whom thus eve yet sinless of the fruit
1	of each tree in the garden we may eate 
1	but of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
1	the garden god hath said ye shall not eate
1	thereof nor shall ye touch it least ye die 
1	she scarse had said though brief when now more bold
1	the tempter but with shew of zeale and love
1	to man and indignation at his wrong 
1	new part puts on and as to passion mov d 
1	fluctuats disturbd yet comely and in act
1	rais d as of som great matter to begin

1	flourishd since mute to som great cause addrest 
1	stood in himself collected while each part 
1	motion each act won audience ere the tongue 
1	somtimes in highth began as no delay
1	of preface brooking through his zeal of right 
1	so standing moving or to highth upgrown
1	the tempter all impassiond thus began 
1	o sacred wise and wisdom giving plant 
1	mother of science now i feel thy power
1	within me cleere not onely to discerne
1	things in thir causes but to trace the wayes
1	of highest agents deemd however wise 
1	queen of this universe doe not believe
1	those rigid threats of death ye shall not die 
1	how should ye by the fruit it gives you life
1	to knowledge by the threatner look on mee 
1	mee who have touch d and tasted yet both live 
1	and life more perfet have attaind then fate
1	meant mee by ventring higher then my lot 
1	shall that be shut to man which to the beast
1	is open or will god incense his ire
1	for such a pretty trespass and not praise
1	rather your dauntless vertue whom the pain
1	of death denounc t whatever thing death be 
1	deterrd not from atchieving what might leade
1	to happier life knowledge of good and evil 
1	of good how just of evil if what is evil
1	be real why not known since easier shunnd 
1	god therefore cannot hurt ye and be just 
1	not just not god not feard then nor obeid 
1	your feare it self of death removes the feare 
1	why then was this forbid why but to awe 
1	why but to keep ye low and ignorant 
1	his worshippers he knows that in the day
1	ye eate thereof your eyes that seem so cleere 
1	yet are but dim shall perfetly be then
1	op nd and cleerd and ye shall be as gods 
1	knowing both good and evil as they know 
1	that ye should be as gods since i as man 
1	internal man is but proportion meet 
1	i of brute human yee of human gods 
1	so ye shalt die perhaps by putting off
1	human to put on gods death to be wisht 
1	though threat nd which no worse then this can bring
1	and what are gods that man may not become
1	as they participating god like food 
1	the gods are first and that advantage use
1	on our belief that all from them proceeds 
1	i question it for this fair earth i see 
1	warm d by the sun producing every kind 
1	them nothing if they all things who enclos d
1	knowledge of good and evil in this tree 
1	that whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
1	wisdom without their leave and wherein lies
1	th offence that man should thus attain to know 
1	what can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
1	impart against his will if all be his 
1	or is it envie and can envie dwell
1	in heav nly brests these these and many more
1	causes import your need of this fair fruit 
1	goddess humane reach then and freely taste 
1	he ended and his words replete with guile
1	into her heart too easie entrance won 
1	fixt on the fruit she gaz d which to behold
1	might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
1	yet rung of his perswasive words impregn d
1	with reason to her seeming and with truth 
1	meanwhile the hour of noon drew on and wak d
1	an eager appetite rais d by the smell
1	so savorie of that fruit which with desire 
1	inclinable now grown to touch or taste 
1	sollicited her longing eye yet first
1	pausing a while thus to her self she mus d 
1	great are thy vertues doubtless best of fruits 
1	though kept from man worthy to be admir d 
1	whose taste too long forborn at first assay
1	gave elocution to the mute and taught
1	the tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise 
1	thy praise hee also who forbids thy use 
1	conceales not from us naming thee the tree
1	of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil 
1	forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
1	commends thee more while it inferrs the good
1	by thee communicated and our want 
1	for good unknown sure is not had or had
1	and yet unknown is as not had at all 
1	in plain then what forbids he but to know 
1	forbids us good forbids us to be wise 
1	such prohibitions binde not but if death
1	bind us with after bands what profits then
1	our inward freedom in the day we eate
1	of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die 
1	how dies the serpent hee hath eat n and lives 
1	and knows and speaks and reasons and discernes 
1	irrational till then for us alone
1	was death invented or to us deni d
1	this intellectual food for beasts reserv d 
1	for beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
1	hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
1	the good befall n him author unsuspect 
1	friendly to man farr from deceit or guile 
1	what fear i then rather what know to feare
1	under this ignorance of good and evil 
1	here grows the cure of all this fruit divine 
1	fair to the eye inviting to the taste 
1	of vertue to make wise what hinders then
1	to reach and feed at once both bodie and mind 
1	so saying her rash hand in evil hour
1	forth reaching to the fruit she pluck d she eat 
1	earth felt the wound and nature from her seat
1	sighing through all her works gave signs of woe 
1	that all was lost back to the thicket slunk
1	the guiltie serpent and well might for eve
1	intent now wholly on her taste naught else
1	regarded such delight till then as seemd 
1	in fruit she never tasted whether true
1	or fansied so through expectation high
1	of knowledg nor was god head from her thought 
1	greedily she ingorg d without restraint 
1	and knew not eating death satiate at length 
1	and hight nd as with wine jocond and boon 
1	thus to her self she pleasingly began 
1	o sovran vertuous precious of all trees
1	in paradise of operation blest
1	to sapience hitherto obscur d infam d 
1	and thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
1	created but henceforth my early care 
1	not without song each morning and due praise
1	shall tend thee and the fertil burden ease
1	of thy full branches offer d free to all 
1	till dieted by thee i grow mature
1	in knowledge as the gods who all things know 
1	though others envie what they cannot give 
1	for had the gift bin theirs it had not here
1	thus grown experience next to thee i owe 
1	best guide not following thee i had remaind
1	in ignorance thou op nst wisdoms way 
1	and giv st access though secret she retire 
1	and i perhaps am secret heav n is high 
1	high and remote to see from thence distinct
1	each thing on earth and other care perhaps
1	may have diverted from continual watch
1	our great forbidder safe with all his spies
1	about him but to adam in what sort
1	shall i appeer shall i to him make known
1	as yet my change and give him to partake
1	full happiness with mee or rather not 
1	but keep the odds of knowledge in my power
1	without copartner so to add what wants
1	in femal sex the more to draw his love 
1	and render me more equal and perhaps
1	a thing not undesireable somtime
1	superior for inferior who is free 
1	this may be well but what if god have seen 
1	and death ensue then i shall be no more 
1	and adam wedded to another eve 
1	shall live with her enjoying i extinct 
1	a death to think confirm d then i resolve 
1	adam shall share with me in bliss or woe 
1	so dear i love him that with him all deaths
1	i could endure without him live no life 
1	so saying from the tree her step she turnd 
1	but first low reverence don as to the power
1	that dwelt within whose presence had infus d
1	into the plant sciential sap deriv d
1	from nectar drink of gods adam the while
1	waiting desirous her return had wove
1	of choicest flours a garland to adorne
1	her tresses and her rural labours crown
1	as reapers oft are wont thir harvest queen 
1	great joy he promis d to his thoughts and new
1	solace in her return so long delay d 
1	yet oft his heart divine of somthing ill 
1	misgave him hee the faultring measure felt 
1	and forth to meet her went the way she took
1	that morn when first they parted by the tree
1	of knowledge he must pass there he her met 
1	scarse from the tree returning in her hand
1	a bough of fairest fruit that downie smil d 
1	new gatherd and ambrosial smell diffus d 
1	to him she hasted in her face excuse
1	came prologue and apologie to prompt 
1	which with bland words at will she thus addrest 
1	hast thou not wonderd adam at my stay 
1	thee i have misst and thought it long depriv d
1	thy presence agonie of love till now
1	not felt nor shall be twice for never more
1	mean i to trie what rash untri d i sought 
1	the paine of absence from thy sight but strange
1	hath bin the cause and wonderful to heare 
1	this tree is not as we are told a tree
1	of danger tasted nor to evil unknown
1	op ning the way but of divine effect
1	to open eyes and make them gods who taste 
1	and hath bin tasted such the serpent wise 
1	or not restraind as wee or not obeying 
1	hath eat n of the fruit and is become 
1	not dead as we are threatn d but thenceforth
1	endu d with human voice and human sense 
1	reasoning to admiration and with mee
1	perswasively hath so prevaild that i
1	have also tasted and have also found
1	th effects to correspond opener mine eyes 
1	dimm erst dilated spirits ampler heart 
1	and growing up to godhead which for thee
1	chiefly i sought without thee can despise 
1	for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss 
1	tedious unshar d with thee and odious soon 
1	thou therefore also taste that equal lot
1	may joyne us equal joy as equal love 
1	least thou not tasting different degree
1	disjoyne us and i then too late renounce
1	deitie for thee when fate will not permit 
1	thus eve with countnance blithe her storie told 
1	but in her cheek distemper flushing glowd 
1	on th other side adam soon as he heard
1	the fatal trespass don by eve amaz d 
1	astonied stood and blank while horror chill
1	ran through his veins and all his joynts relax d 
1	from his slack hand the garland wreath d for eve
1	down drop d and all the faded roses shed 
1	speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
1	first to himself he inward silence broke 
1	o fairest of creation last and best
1	of all gods works creature in whom excell d
1	whatever can to fight or thought be found 
1	holy divine good amiable or sweet 
1	how art thou lost how on a sudden lost 
1	defac t deflourd and now to death devote 
1	rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress
1	the strict forbiddance how to violate
1	the sacred fruit forbidd n som cursed fraud
1	of enemie hath beguil d thee yet unknown 
1	and mee with thee hath ruind for with thee
1	certain my resolution is to die 
1	how can i live without thee how forgoe
1	thy sweet converse and love so dearly joyn d 
1	to live again in these wilde woods forlorn 
1	should god create another eve and i
1	another rib afford yet loss of thee
1	would never from my heart no no i feel
1	the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh 
1	bone of my bone thou art and from thy state

1	so having said as one from sad dismay
1	recomforted and after thoughts disturbd
1	submitting to what seemd remediless 
1	thus in calme mood his words to eve he turnd 
1	bold deed thou hast presum d adventrous eve 
1	and peril great provok t who thus hast dar d
1	had it bin onely coveting to eye
1	that sacred fruit sacred to abstinence 
1	much more to taste it under banne to touch 
1	but past who can recall or don undoe 
1	not god omnipotent for fate yet so
1	perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
1	is not so hainous now foretasted fruit 
1	profan d first by the serpent by him first
1	made common and unhallowd ere one tastes 
1	nor yet on him found deadly he yet lives 
1	lives as thou saidst and gaines to live as man
1	higher degree of life inducement strong
1	to us as likely tasting to attaine
1	proportional ascent which cannot be
1	but to be gods or angels demi gods 
1	nor can i think that god creator wise

1	i saw thee first and wedded thee adorn d
1	with all perfections so enflame my sense
1	with ardor to enjoy thee fairer now
1	then ever bountie of this vertuous tree

1	took largely of thir mutual guilt the seale 
1	the solace of thir sin till dewie sleep
1	oppress d them wearied with thir amorous play 
1	soon as the force of that fallacious fruit 
1	that with exhilerating vapour bland
1	about thir spirits had plaid and inmost powers
1	made erre was now exhal d and grosser sleep
1	bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
1	encumberd now had left them up they rose
1	as from unrest and each the other viewing 
1	soon found thir eyes how op nd and thir minds
1	how dark nd innocence that as a veile
1	had shadow d them from knowing ill was gon 
1	just confidence and native righteousness 
1	and honour from about them naked left
1	to guiltie shame hee cover d but his robe
1	uncover d more so rose the danite strong

1	of philistean dalilah and wak d
1	shorn of his strength they destitute and bare

1	confounded long they sate as struck n mute 
1	till adam though not less then eve abasht 
1	at length gave utterance to these words constraind 
1	o eve in evil hour thou didst give care
1	to that false worm of whomsoever taught
1	to counterfet mans voice true in our fall 
1	false in our promis d rising since our eyes
1	op nd we find indeed and find we know
1	both good and evil good lost and evil got 
1	bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know 
1	which leaves us naked thus of honour void 
1	our wonted ornaments now soild and staind 
1	and in our faces evident the signes
1	of foul concupiscence whence evil store 
1	even shame the last of evils of the first
1	be sure then how shall i behold the face
1	henceforth of god or angel earst with joy
1	and rapture so oft beheld those heav nly shapes
1	will dazle now this earthly with thir blaze
1	insufferably bright o might i here
1	in solitude live savage in some glad
1	obscur d where highest woods impenetrable
1	to starr or sun light spread thir umbrage broad 
1	and brown as evening cover me ye pines 
1	ye cedars with innumerable boughs
1	hide me where i may never see them more 
1	but let us now as in bad plight devise
1	what best may for the present serve to hide
1	the parts of each from other that seem most
1	to shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen 
1	some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sowd 
1	and girded on our loyns may cover round
1	those middle parts that this new commer shame 
1	there sit not and reproach us as unclean 
1	so counsel d hee and both together went
1	into the thickest wood there soon they chose
1	the figtree not that kind for fruit renown d 
1	but such as at this day to indians known
1	in malabar or decan spreds her armes
1	braunching so broad and long that in the ground
1	the bended twigs take root and daughters grow
1	about the mother tree a pillard shade
1	high overarch t and echoing walks between 
1	there oft the indian herdsman shunning heate
1	shelters in coole and tends his pasturing herds
1	at loopholes cut through thickest shade those leaves
1	they gatherd broad as amazonian targe 
1	and with what skill they had together sowd 
1	to gird thir waste vain covering if to hide
1	thir guilt and dreaded shame o how unlike
1	to that first naked glorie such of late
1	columbus found th american to girt
1	with featherd cincture naked else and wilde
1	among the trees on iles and woodie shores 
1	thus fenc t and as they thought thir shame in part
1	coverd but not at rest or ease of mind 
1	they sate them down to weep nor onely teares
1	raind at thir eyes but high winds worse within
1	began to rise high passions anger hate 
1	mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore
1	thir inward state of mind calme region once
1	and full of peace now tost and turbulent 
1	for understanding rul d not and the will
1	heard not her lore both in subjection now

1	remaind still happie not as now despoild
1	of all our good sham d naked miserable 
1	let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve

1	as good have grown there still a liveless rib 
1	being as i am why didst not thou the head
1	command me absolutely not to go 
1	going into such danger as thou saidst 
1	too facil then thou didst not much gainsay

1	and am i now upbraided as the cause
1	of thy transgressing not enough severe 
1	it seems in thy restraint what could i more 
1	i warn d thee i admonish d thee foretold
1	the danger and the lurking enemie
1	that lay in wait beyond this had bin force 
1	and force upon free will hath here no place 
1	but confidence then bore thee on secure
1	either to meet no danger or to finde
1	matter of glorious trial and perhaps
1	i also err d in overmuch admiring
1	what seemd in thee so perfet that i thought
1	no evil durst attempt thee but i rue
1	that errour now which is become my crime 
1	and thou th accuser thus it shall befall
1	him who to worth in women overtrusting

1	thus they in mutual accusation spent
1	the fruitless hours but neither self condemning
1	and of thir vain contest appeer d no end 
1	meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act
1	of satan done in paradise and how

1	convict by flight and rebel to all law
1	conviction to the serpent none belongs 
1	thus saying from his radiant seat he rose
1	of high collateral glorie him thrones and powers 
1	princedoms and dominations ministrant
1	accompanied to heaven gate from whence
1	eden and all the coast in prospect lay 
1	down he descended strait the speed of gods
1	time counts not though with swiftest minutes wing d 
1	now was the sun in western cadence low
1	from noon and gentle aires due at thir hour
1	to fan the earth now wak d and usher in
1	the eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole
1	came the mild judge and intercessor both
1	to sentence man the voice of god they heard
1	now walking in the garden by soft windes
1	brought to thir ears while day declin d they heard
1	and from his presence hid themselves among
1	the thickest trees both man and wife till god
1	approaching thus to adam call d aloud 
1	where art thou adam wont with joy to meet
1	my coming seen far off i miss thee here 
1	not pleas d thus entertaind with solitude 
1	where obvious dutie erewhile appear d unsaught 
1	or come i less conspicuous or what change
1	absents thee or what chance detains come forth 
1	he came and with him eve more loth though first
1	to offend discount nanc t both and discompos d 
1	love was not in thir looks either to god
1	or to each other but apparent guilt 
1	and shame and perturbation and despaire 
1	anger and obstinacie and hate and guile 
1	whence adam faultring long thus answer d brief 
1	i heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
1	affraid being naked hid my self to whom
1	the gracious judge without revile repli d 
1	my voice thou oft hast heard and hast not fear d 
1	but still rejoyc t how is it now become
1	so dreadful to thee that thou art naked who
1	hath told thee hast thou eaten of the tree
1	whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat 
1	to whom thus adam sore beset repli d 
1	o heav n in evil strait this day i stand
1	before my judge either to undergoe
1	my self the total crime or to accuse
1	my other self the partner of my life 
1	whose failing while her faith to me remaines 
1	i should conceal and not expose to blame
1	by my complaint but strict necessitie
1	subdues me and calamitous constraint 
1	least on my head both sin and punishment 
1	however insupportable be all
1	devolv d though should i hold my peace yet thou
1	wouldst easily detect what i conceale 
1	this woman whom thou mad st to be my help 
1	and gav st me as thy perfet gift so good 
1	so fit so acceptable so divine 
1	that from her hand i could suspect no ill 
1	and what she did whatever in it self 
1	her doing seem d to justifie the deed 
1	shee gave me of the tree and i did eate 
1	to whom the sovran presence thus repli d 
1	was shee thy god that her thou didst obey
1	before his voice or was shee made thy guide 
1	superior or but equal that to her
1	thou did st resigne thy manhood and the place
1	wherein god set thee above her made of thee 
1	and for thee whose perfection farr excell d
1	hers in all real dignitie adornd
1	she was indeed and lovely to attract
1	were such as under government well seem d 
1	unseemly to beare rule which was thy part
1	and person had st thou known thy self aright 
1	so having said he thus to eve in few 
1	say woman what is this which thou hast done 
1	to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelm d 
1	confessing soon yet not before her judge
1	bold or loquacious thus abasht repli d 
1	the serpent me beguil d and i did eate 
1	which when the lord god heard without delay
1	to judgement he proceeded on th accus d
1	serpent though brute unable to transferre
1	the guilt on him who made him instrument
1	of mischief and polluted from the end
1	of his creation justly then accurst 
1	as vitiated in nature more to know
1	concern d not man since he no further knew 
1	nor alter d his offence yet god at last
1	to satan first in sin his doom apply d 
1	though in mysterious terms judg d as then best 
1	and on the serpent thus his curse let fall 
1	because thou hast done this thou art accurst
1	above all cattel each beast of the field 
1	upon thy belly groveling thou shalt goe 
1	and dust shalt eat all the days of thy life 
1	between thee and the woman i will put
1	enmitie and between thine and her seed 
1	her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel 
1	so spake this oracle then verifi d
1	when jesus son of mary second eve 
1	saw satan fall like lightning down from heav n 
1	prince of the aire then rising from his grave
1	spoild principalities and powers triumpht
1	in open shew and with ascention bright
1	captivity led captive through the aire 
1	the realme it self of satan long usurpt 
1	whom he shall tread at last under our feet 
1	eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise 
1	and to the woman thus his sentence turn d 
1	thy sorrow i will greatly multiplie
1	by thy conception children thou shalt bring
1	in sorrow forth and to thy husbands will
1	thine shall submit hee over thee shall rule 
1	on adam last thus judgement he pronounc d 
1	because thou hast heark nd to the voice of thy wife 
1	and eaten of the tree concerning which
1	i charg d thee saying thou shalt not eate thereof 
1	curs d is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
1	shalt eate thereof all the days of thy life 
1	thornes also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
1	unbid and thou shalt eate th herb of th field 
1	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread 
1	till thou return unto the ground for thou
1	out of the ground wast taken know thy birth 
1	for dust thou art and shalt to dust returne 
1	so judg d he man both judge and saviour sent 
1	and th instant stroke of death denounc t that day
1	remov d farr off then pittying how they stood
1	before him naked to the aire that now
1	must suffer change disdain d not to begin
1	thenceforth the forme of servant to assume 
1	as when he wash d his servants feet so now
1	as father of his familie he clad
1	thir nakedness with skins of beasts or slain 
1	or as the snake with youthful coate repaid 
1	and thought not much to cloath his enemies 
1	nor hee thir outward onely with the skins
1	of beasts but inward nakedness much more
1	opprobrious with his robe of righteousness 
1	araying cover d from his fathers sight 
1	to him with swift ascent he up returnd 
1	into his blissful bosom reassum d
1	in glory as of old to him appeas d
1	all though all knowing what had past with man
1	recounted mixing intercession sweet 
1	meanwhile ere thus was sin d and judg d on earth 
1	within the gates of hell sate sin and death 
1	in counterview within the gates that now
1	stood open wide belching outrageous flame
1	farr into chaos since the fiend pass d through 
1	sin opening who thus now to death began 
1	o son why sit we here each other viewing
1	idlely while satan our great author thrives
1	in other worlds and happier seat provides
1	for us his ofspring deare it cannot be
1	but that success attends him if mishap 
1	ere this he had return d with fury driv n
1	by his avenger since no place like this
1	can fit his punishment or their revenge 
1	methinks i feel new strength within me rise

1	powerful at greatest distance to unite
1	with secret amity things of like kinde
1	by secretest conveyance thou my shade
1	inseparable must with mee along 
1	for death from sin no power can separate 
1	but least the difficultie of passing back
1	stay his returne perhaps over this gulfe
1	impassable impervious let us try
1	adventrous work yet to thy power and mine
1	not unagreeable to found a path
1	over this maine from hell to that new world
1	where satan now prevailes a monument
1	of merit high to all th infernal host 
1	easing thir passage hence for intercourse 
1	or transmigration as thir lot shall lead 
1	nor can i miss the way so strongly drawn

1	so saying with delight he snuff d the smell
1	of mortal change on earth as when a flock

1	from out of chaos to the outside bare
1	of this round world with pinns of adamant
1	and chains they made all fast too fast they made
1	and durable and now in little space

1	thus to disburd n sought with sad complaint 
1	o miserable of happie is this the end
1	of this new glorious world and mee so late
1	the glory of that glory who now becom
1	accurst of blessed hide me from the face
1	of god whom to behold was then my highth
1	of happiness yet well if here would end
1	the miserie i deserv d it and would beare

1	for this we may thank adam but his thanks
1	shall be the execration so besides

1	shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound 
1	on mee as on thir natural center light
1	heavie though in thir place o fleeting joyes
1	of paradise deare bought with lasting woes 
1	did i request thee maker from my clay
1	to mould me man did i sollicite thee
1	from darkness to promote me or here place
1	in this delicious garden as my will
1	concurd not to my being it were but right
1	and equal to reduce me to my dust 
1	desirous to resigne and render back
1	all i receav d unable to performe
1	thy terms too hard by which i was to hold
1	the good i sought not to the loss of that 
1	sufficient penaltie why hast thou added
1	the sense of endless woes inexplicable
1	thy justice seems yet to say truth too late 
1	i thus contest then should have been refusd
1	those terms whatever when they were propos d 
1	thou didst accept them wilt thou enjoy the good 
1	then cavil the conditions and though god
1	made thee without thy leave what if thy son
1	prove disobedient and reprov d retort 
1	wherefore didst thou beget me i sought it not 
1	wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee
1	that proud excuse yet him not thy election 
1	but natural necessity begot 
1	god made thee of choice his own and of his own
1	to serve him thy reward was of his grace 
1	thy punishment then justly is at his will 
1	be it so for i submit his doom is fair 
1	that dust i am and shall to dust returne 
1	o welcom hour whenever why delayes
1	his hand to execute what his decree
1	fixd on this day why do i overlive 
1	why am i mockt with death and length nd out
1	to deathless pain how gladly would i meet
1	mortalitie my sentence and be earth
1	insensible how glad would lay me down
1	as in my mothers lap there i should rest
1	and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
1	would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
1	to mee and to my ofspring would torment me
1	with cruel expectation yet one doubt
1	pursues me still least all i cannot die 
1	least that pure breath of life the spirit of man
1	which god inspir d cannot together perish
1	with this corporeal clod then in the grave 
1	or in some other dismal place who knows
1	but i shall die a living death o thought
1	horrid if true yet why it was but breath
1	of life that sinn d what dies but what had life
1	and sin the bodie properly hath neither 
1	all of me then shall die let this appease
1	the doubt since humane reach no further knows 
1	for though the lord of all be infinite 
1	is his wrauth also be it man is not so 
1	but mortal doom d how can he exercise
1	wrath without end on man whom death must end 
1	can he make deathless death that were to make
1	strange contradiction which to god himself
1	impossible is held as argument
1	of weakness not of power will he draw out 
1	for angers sake finite to infinite
1	in punisht man to satisfie his rigour
1	satisfi d never that were to extend
1	his sentence beyond dust and natures law 
1	by which all causes else according still
1	to the reception of thir matter act 
1	not to th extent of thir own spheare but say
1	that death be not one stroak as i suppos d 
1	bereaving sense but endless miserie
1	from this day onward which i feel begun
1	both in me and without me and so last
1	to perpetuitie ay me that fear
1	comes thundring back with dreadful revolution
1	on my defensless head both death and i
1	am found eternal and incorporate both 
1	nor i on my part single in mee all
1	posteritie stands curst fair patrimonie
1	that i must leave ye sons o were i able
1	to waste it all my self and leave ye none 
1	so disinherited how would ye bless
1	me now your curse ah why should all mankind
1	for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn d 
1	if guiltless but from mee what can proceed 
1	but all corrupt both mind and will deprav d 
1	not to do onely but to will the same
1	with me how can they acquitted stand
1	in sight of god him after all disputes
1	forc t i absolve all my evasions vain
1	and reasonings though through mazes lead me still
1	but to my own conviction first and last
1	on mee mee onely as the sourse and spring
1	of all corruption all the blame lights due 
1	so might the wrauth fond wish couldst thou support
1	that burden heavier then the earth to bear 
1	then all the world much heavier though divided
1	with that bad woman thus what thou desir st 
1	and what thou fearst alike destroyes all hope
1	of refuge and concludes thee miserable
1	beyond all past example and future 
1	to satan onely like both crime and doom 
1	o conscience into what abyss of fears
1	and horrors hast thou driv n me out of which
1	i find no way from deep to deeper plung d 
1	thus adam to himself lamented loud
1	through the still night now now as ere man fell 
1	wholsom and cool and mild but with black air
1	accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom 
1	which to his evil conscience represented
1	all things with double terror on the ground
1	outstretcht he lay on the cold ground and oft
1	curs d his creation death as oft accus d
1	the day of his offence why comes not death 
1	said hee with one thrice acceptable stroke
1	to end me shall truth fail to keep her word 
1	justice divine not hast n to be just 
1	but death comes not at call justice divine
1	mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries 
1	with other echo farr i taught your shades
1	to answer and resound farr other song 
1	whom thus afflicted when sad eve beheld 
1	desolate where she sate approaching nigh 
1	soft words to his fierce passion she assay d 
1	but her with stern regard he thus repell d 
1	out of my sight thou serpent that name best
1	befits thee with him leagu d thy self as false
1	and hateful nothing wants but that thy shape 
1	like his and colour serpentine may shew
1	thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
1	henceforth least that too heav nly form pretended
1	to hellish falshood snare them but for thee
1	i had persisted happie had not thy pride
1	and wandring vanitie when lest was safe 
1	rejected my forewarning and disdain d
1	not to be trusted longing to be seen
1	though by the devil himself him overweening
1	to over reach but with the serpent meeting
1	fool d and beguil d by him thou i by thee 
1	to trust thee from my side imagin d wise 
1	constant mature proof against all assaults 
1	and understood not all was but a shew
1	rather then solid vertu all but a rib
1	crooked by nature bent as now appears 
1	more to the part sinister from me drawn 
1	well if thrown out as supernumerarie
1	to my just number found o why did god 
1	creator wise that peopl d highest heav n
1	with spirits masculine create at last
1	this noveltie on earth this fair defect
1	of nature and not fill the world at once
1	with men as angels without feminine 
1	or find some other way to generate
1	mankind this mischief had not then befall n 
1	and more that shall befall innumerable
1	disturbances on earth through femal snares 
1	and straight conjunction with this sex for either
1	he never shall find out fit mate but such
1	as some misfortune brings him or mistake 
1	or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
1	through her perverseness but shall see her gaind
1	by a farr worse or if she love withheld
1	by parents or his happiest choice too late
1	shall meet alreadie linkt and wedlock bound
1	to a fell adversarie his hate or shame 
1	which infinite calamitie shall cause

1	he added not and from her turn d but eve
1	not so repulst with tears that ceas d not flowing

1	as in our evils and of easier choice 
1	if care of our descent perplex us most 
1	which must be born to certain woe devourd
1	by death at last and miserable it is
1	to be to others cause of misery 
1	our own begotten and of our loines to bring
1	into this cursed world a woful race 
1	that after wretched life must be at last
1	food for so foule a monster in thy power
1	it lies yet ere conception to prevent

1	conversing looking loving to abstain
1	from loves due rites nuptial embraces sweet 
1	and with desire to languish without hope 
1	before the present object languishing
1	with like desire which would be miserie
1	and torment less then none of what we dread 
1	then both our selves and seed at once to free
1	from what we fear for both let us make short 
1	let us seek death or hee not found supply
1	with our own hands his office on our selves 
1	why stand we longer shivering under feares 
1	that shew no end but death and have the power 
1	of many wayes to die the shortest choosing 
1	destruction with destruction to destroy 
1	she ended heer or vehement despaire
1	broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts

1	to better hopes his more attentive minde
1	labouring had rais d and thus to eve repli d 
1	eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
1	to argue in thee somthing more sublime
1	and excellent then what thy minde contemnes 
1	but self destruction therefore saught refutes
1	that excellence thought in thee and implies 
1	not thy contempt but anguish and regret
1	for loss of life and pleasure overlov d 
1	or if thou covet death as utmost end
1	of miserie so thinking to evade
1	the penaltie pronounc t doubt not but god
1	hath wiselier arm d his vengeful ire then so
1	to be forestall d much more i fear least death
1	so snatcht will not exempt us from the paine
1	we are by doom to pay rather such acts
1	of contumacie will provoke the highest
1	to make death in us live then let us seek

1	his eye might there command wherever stood

1	of mightiest empire from the destind walls
1	of cambalu seat of cathaian can
1	to paquin of sinaean kings and thence
1	to agra and lahor of great mogul
1	down to the golden chersonese or where
1	the persian in ecbatan sate or since
1	in hispahan or where the russian ksar
1	turchestan born nor could his eye not ken

1	ercoco and the less maritine kings
1	and sofala thought ophir to the realme
1	of congo and angola fardest south 
1	or thence from niger flood to atlas mount
1	on europe thence and where rome was to sway
1	the world in spirit perhaps he also saw
1	rich mexico the seat of motezume 
1	and cusco in peru the richer seat
1	of atabalipa and yet unspoil d
1	guiana whose great citie geryons sons
1	call el dorado but to nobler sights
1	michael from adams eyes the filme remov d
1	which that false fruit that promis d clearer sight
1	had bred then purg d with euphrasie and rue
1	the visual nerve for he had much to see 
1	and from the well of life three drops instill d 
1	so deep the power of these ingredients pierc d 
1	eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight 
1	that adam now enforc t to close his eyes 
1	sunk down and all his spirits became intranst 
1	but him the gentle angel by the hand
1	soon rais d and his attention thus recall d 
1	adam now ope thine eyes and first behold
1	th effects which thy original crime hath wrought
1	in some to spring from thee who never touch d
1	th excepted tree nor with the snake conspir d 
1	nor sinn d thy sin yet from that sin derive
1	corruption to bring forth more violent deeds 
1	his eyes he op nd and beheld a field 
1	part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves
1	new reapt the other part sheep walks and foulds 
1	ith midst an altar as the land mark stood
1	rustic of grassie sord thither anon
1	a sweatie reaper from his tillage brought
1	first fruits the green eare and the yellow sheaf 
1	uncull d as came to hand a shepherd next
1	more meek came with the firstlings of his flock
1	choicest and best then sacrificing laid
1	the inwards and thir fat with incense strew d 
1	on the cleft wood and all due rites perform d 
1	his offring soon propitious fire from heav n
1	consum d with nimble glance and grateful steame 
1	the others not for his was not sincere 
1	whereat hee inlie rag d and as they talk d 
1	smote him into the midriff with a stone
1	that beat out life he fell and deadly pale
1	groand out his soul with gushing bloud effus d 
1	much at that sight was adam in his heart
1	dismai d and thus in haste to th angel cri d 
1	o teacher some great mischief hath befall n
1	to that meek man who well had sacrific d 
1	is pietie thus and pure devotion paid 
1	t whom michael thus hee also mov d repli d 
1	these two are brethren adam and to come
1	out of thy loyns th unjust the just hath slain 
1	for envie that his brothers offering found
1	from heav n acceptance but the bloodie fact
1	will be aveng d and th others faith approv d
1	loose no reward though here thou see him die 
1	rowling in dust and gore to which our sire 
1	alas both for the deed and for the cause 
1	but have i now seen death is this the way
1	i must return to native dust o sight
1	of terrour foul and ugly to behold 
1	horrid to think how horrible to feel 
1	to whom thus michael death thou hast seen
1	in his first shape on man but many shapes
1	of death and many are the wayes that lead
1	to his grim cave all dismal yet to sense
1	more terrible at th entrance then within 
1	some as thou saw st by violent stroke shall die 
1	by fire flood famin by intemperance more
1	in meats and drinks which on the earth shal bring
1	diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
1	before thee shall appear that thou mayst know
1	what miserie th inabstinence of eve
1	shall bring on men immediately a place
1	before his eyes appeard sad noysom dark 
1	a lazar house it seemd wherein were laid
1	numbers of all diseas d all maladies
1	of gastly spasm or racking torture qualmes
1	of heart sick agonie all feavorous kinds 
1	convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs 
1	intestin stone and ulcer colic pangs 
1	dropsies and asthma s and joint racking rheums 
1	dire was the tossing deep the groans despair
1	tended the sick busiest from couch to couch 
1	and over them triumphant death his dart
1	shook but delaid to strike though oft invok t
1	with vows as thir chief good and final hope 
1	sight so deform what heart of rock could long
1	drie ey d behold adam could not but wept 
1	though not of woman born compassion quell d
1	his best of man and gave him up to tears
1	a space till firmer thoughts restraind excess 
1	and scarce recovering words his plaint renew d 
1	o miserable mankind to what fall
1	degraded to what wretched state reserv d 
1	better end heer unborn why is life giv n
1	to be thus wrested from us rather why
1	obtruded on us thus who if we knew
1	what we receive would either not accept
1	life offer d or soon beg to lay it down 
1	glad to be so dismist in peace can thus
1	th image of god in man created once
1	so goodly and erect though faultie since 
1	to such unsightly sufferings be debas t
1	under inhuman pains why should not man 
1	retaining still divine similitude
1	in part from such deformities be free 
1	and for his makers image sake exempt 
1	thir makers image answerd michael then
1	forsook them when themselves they villifi d
1	to serve ungovern d appetite and took
1	his image whom they serv d a brutish vice 
1	inductive mainly to the sin of eve 
1	therefore so abject is thir punishment 
1	disfiguring not gods likeness but thir own 
1	or if his likeness by themselves defac t
1	while they pervert pure natures healthful rules
1	to loathsom sickness worthily since they
1	gods image did not reverence in themselves 
1	i yeild it just said adam and submit 
1	but is there yet no other way besides
1	these painful passages how we may come
1	to death and mix with our connatural dust 
1	there is said michael if thou well observe
1	the rule of not too much by temperance taught
1	in what thou eatst and drinkst seeking from thence
1	due nourishment not gluttonous delight 
1	till many years over thy head return 
1	so maist thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop
1	into thy mothers lap or be with ease
1	gatherd not harshly pluckt for death mature 
1	this is old age but then thou must outlive
1	thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change
1	to witherd weak gray thy senses then
1	obtuse all taste of pleasure must forgoe 
1	to what thou hast and for the aire of youth
1	hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reigne
1	a melancholly damp of cold and dry
1	to waigh thy spirits down and last consume
1	the balme of life to whom our ancestor 
1	henceforth i flie not death nor would prolong
1	life much bent rather how i may be quit
1	fairest and easiest of this combrous charge 
1	which i must keep till my appointed day
1	of rendring up michael to him repli d 
1	nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livst
1	live well how long or short permit to heav n 
1	and now prepare thee for another sight 
1	he lookd and saw a spacious plaine whereon
1	were tents of various hue by some were herds
1	of cattel grazing others whence the sound
1	of instruments that made melodious chime
1	was heard of harp and organ and who moovd
1	thir stops and chords was seen his volant touch
1	instinct through all proportions low and high
1	fled and pursu d transverse the resonant fugue 
1	in other part stood one who at the forge
1	labouring two massie clods of iron and brass
1	had melted whether found where casual fire
1	had wasted woods on mountain or in vale 
1	down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot
1	to som caves mouth or whether washt by stream
1	from underground the liquid ore he dreind
1	into fit moulds prepar d from which he formd
1	first his own tooles then what might else be wrought
1	fulfil or grav n in mettle after these 
1	but on the hether side a different sort
1	from the high neighbouring hills which was thir seat 
1	down to the plain descended by thir guise
1	just men they seemd and all thir study bent
1	to worship god aright and know his works
1	not hid nor those things lost which might preserve
1	freedom and peace to men they on the plain
1	long had not walkt when from the tents behold
1	a beavie of fair women richly gay
1	in gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung
1	soft amorous ditties and in dance came on 
1	the men though grave ey d them and let thir eyes
1	rove without rein till in the amorous net
1	fast caught they lik d and each his liking chose 
1	and now of love they treat till th eevning star
1	loves harbinger appeerd then all in heat
1	they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke
1	hymen then first to marriage rites invok t 
1	with feast and musick all the tents resound 
1	such happy interview and fair event
1	of love youth not lost songs garlands flours 
1	and charming symphonies attach d the heart
1	of adam soon enclin d to admit delight 
1	the bent of nature which he thus express d 
1	true opener of mine eyes prime angel blest 
1	much better seems this vision and more hope
1	of peaceful dayes portends then those two past 
1	those were of hate and death or pain much worse 
1	here nature seems fulfilld in all her ends 
1	to whom thus michael judg not what is best
1	by pleasure though to nature seeming meet 
1	created as thou art to nobler end
1	holie and pure conformitie divine 
1	those tents thou sawst so pleasant were the tents
1	of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race
1	who slew his brother studious they appere
1	of arts that polish life inventers rare 
1	unmindful of thir maker though his spirit
1	taught them but they his gifts acknowledg d none 
1	yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget 
1	for that fair femal troop thou sawst that seemd
1	of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay 
1	yet empty of all good wherein consists
1	womans domestic honour and chief praise 
1	bred onely and completed to the taste
1	of lustful apperence to sing to dance 
1	to dress and troule the tongue and roule the eye 
1	to these that sober race of men whose lives
1	religious titl d them the sons of god 
1	shall yeild up all thir vertue all thir fame
1	ignobly to the trains and to the smiles
1	of these fair atheists and now swim in joy 
1	 erelong to swim at larg and laugh for which
1	the world erelong a world of tears must weepe 
1	to whom thus adam of short joy bereft 
1	o pittie and shame that they who to live well
1	enterd so faire should turn aside to tread
1	paths indirect or in the mid way faint 
1	but still i see the tenor of mans woe
1	holds on the same from woman to begin 
1	from mans effeminate slackness it begins 
1	said th angel who should better hold his place
1	by wisdome and superiour gifts receavd 
1	but now prepare thee for another scene 
1	he lookd and saw wide territorie spred
1	before him towns and rural works between 
1	cities of men with lofty gates and towrs 
1	concours in arms fierce faces threatning warr 
1	giants of mightie bone and bould emprise 
1	part wield thir arms part courb the foaming steed 
1	single or in array of battel rang d
1	both horse and foot nor idely mustring stood 
1	one way a band select from forage drives
1	a herd of beeves faire oxen and faire kine
1	from a fat meddow ground or fleecy flock 
1	ewes and thir bleating lambs over the plaine 
1	thir bootie scarce with life the shepherds flye 
1	but call in aide which tacks a bloody fray 
1	with cruel tournament the squadrons joine 
1	where cattel pastur d late now scatterd lies
1	with carcasses and arms th ensanguind field
1	deserted others to a citie strong
1	lay siege encampt by batterie scale and mine 
1	assaulting others from the wall defend
1	with dart and jav lin stones and sulfurous fire 
1	on each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds 
1	in other part the scepter d haralds call
1	to council in the citie gates anon
1	grey headed men and grave with warriours mixt 
1	assemble and harangues are heard but soon
1	in factious opposition till at last
1	of middle age one rising eminent
1	in wise deport spake much of right and wrong 
1	and judgement from above him old and young
1	exploded and had seiz d with violent hands 
1	had not a cloud descending snatch d him thence
1	unseen amid the throng so violence
1	through all the plain and refuge none was found 
1	adam was all in tears and to his guide
1	lamenting turnd full sad o what are these 
1	deaths ministers not men who thus deal death
1	inhumanly to men and multiply
1	ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew
1	his brother for of whom such massacher
1	make they but of thir brethren men of men 
1	but who was that just man whom had not heav n
1	rescu d had in his righteousness bin lost 
1	to whom thus michael these are the product
1	of those ill mated marriages thou saw st 
1	where good with bad were matcht who of themselves
1	abhor to joyn and by imprudence mixt 
1	produce prodigious births of bodie or mind 
1	such were these giants men of high renown 
1	for in those dayes might onely shall be admir d 
1	and valour and heroic vertu call d 
1	to overcome in battel and subdue
1	nations and bring home spoils with infinite
1	man slaughter shall be held the highest pitch
1	of human glorie and for glorie done
1	of triumph to be styl d great conquerours 
1	destroyers rightlier call d and plagues of men 
1	thus fame shall be achiev d renown on earth 
1	and what most merits fame in silence hid 
1	but hee the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst
1	the onely righteous in a world perverse 
1	and therefore hated therefore so beset
1	with foes for daring single to be just 
1	and utter odious truth that god would come
1	to judge them with his saints him the most high
1	rapt in a balmie cloud with winged steeds
1	did as thou sawst receave to walk with god
1	high in salvation and the climes of bliss 
1	exempt from death to shew thee what reward
1	awaits the good the rest what punishment 
1	which now direct thine eyes and soon behold 
1	he look d saw the face of things quite chang d 
1	the brazen throat of warr had ceast to roar 
1	all now was turn d to jollitie and game 
1	to luxurie and riot feast and dance 
1	marrying or prostituting as befell 
1	rape or adulterie where passing faire
1	allurd them thence from cups to civil broiles 
1	at length a reverend sire among them came 
1	and of thir doings great dislike declar d 
1	and testifi d against thir wayes hee oft
1	frequented thir assemblies whereso met 
1	triumphs or festivals and to them preachd
1	in prison under judgements imminent 
1	but all in vain which when he saw he ceas d
1	contending and remov d his tents farr off 
1	then from the mountain hewing timber tall 
1	began to build a vessel of huge bulk 
1	measur d by cubit length breadth and highth 
1	smeard round with pitch and in the side a dore
1	contriv d and of provisions laid in large
1	for man and beast when loe a wonder strange 
1	of everie beast and bird and insect small
1	came seavens and pairs and enterd in as taught
1	thir order last the sire and his three sons
1	with thir four wives and god made fast the dore 
1	meanwhile the southwind rose with black wings
1	wide hovering all the clouds together drove
1	from under heav n the hills to their supplie
1	vapour and exhalation dusk and moist 
1	sent up amain and now the thick nd skie
1	like a dark ceeling stood down rush d the rain
1	impetuous and continu d till the earth
1	no more was seen the floating vessel swum
1	uplifted and secure with beaked prow
1	rode tilting o re the waves all dwellings else
1	flood overwhelmd and them with all thir pomp
1	deep under water rould sea cover d sea 
1	sea without shoar and in thir palaces
1	where luxurie late reign d sea monsters whelp d
1	and stabl d of mankind so numerous late 
1	all left in one small bottom swum imbark t 
1	how didst thou grieve then adam to behold
1	the end of all thy ofspring end so sad 
1	depopulation thee another floud 
1	of tears and sorrow a floud thee also drown d 
1	and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reard
1	by th angel on thy feet thou stoodst at last 
1	though comfortless as when a father mourns
1	his childern all in view destroyd at once 
1	and scarce to th angel utterdst thus thy plaint 
1	o visions ill foreseen better had i
1	liv d ignorant of future so had borne
1	my part of evil onely each dayes lot
1	anough to bear those now that were dispenst
1	the burd n of many ages on me light
1	at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth
1	abortive to torment me ere thir being 
1	with thought that they must be let no man seek
1	henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
1	him or his childern evil he may be sure 
1	which neither his foreknowing can prevent 
1	and hee the future evil shall no less
1	in apprehension then in substance feel
1	grievous to bear but that care now is past 
1	man is not whom to warne those few escap t
1	famin and anguish will at last consume
1	wandring that watrie desert i had hope
1	when violence was ceas t and warr on earth 
1	all would have then gon well peace would have crownd
1	with length of happy days the race of man 
1	but i was farr deceav d for now i see
1	peace to corrupt no less then warr to waste 
1	how comes it thus unfould celestial guide 
1	and whether here the race of man will end 
1	to whom thus michael those whom last thou sawst
1	in triumph and luxurious wealth are they
1	first seen in acts of prowess eminent
1	and great exploits but of true vertu void 
1	who having spilt much blood and don much waste
1	subduing nations and achievd thereby
1	fame in the world high titles and rich prey 
1	shall change thir course to pleasure ease and sloth 
1	surfet and lust till wantonness and pride
1	raise out of friendship hostil deeds in peace 
1	the conquerd also and enslav d by warr
1	shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose
1	and feare of god from whom thir pietie feign d
1	in sharp contest of battel found no aide
1	against invaders therefore coold in zeale
1	thenceforth shall practice how to live secure 
1	worldlie or dissolute on what thir lords
1	shall leave them to enjoy for th earth shall bear
1	more then anough that temperance may be tri d 
1	so all shall turn degenerate all deprav d 
1	justice and temperance truth and faith forgot 
1	one man except the onely son of light
1	in a dark age against example good 
1	against allurement custom and a world
1	offended fearless of reproach and scorn 
1	or violence hee of thir wicked wayes
1	shall them admonish and before them set
1	the paths of righteousness how much more safe 
1	and full of peace denouncing wrauth to come
1	on thir impenitence and shall returne
1	of them derided but of god observd
1	the one just man alive by his command
1	shall build a wondrous ark as thou beheldst 
1	to save himself and houshold from amidst
1	a world devote to universal rack 
1	no sooner hee with them of man and beast
1	select for life shall in the ark be lodg d 
1	and shelterd round but all the cataracts
1	of heav n set open on the earth shall powre
1	raine day and night all fountaines of the deep
1	broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp
1	beyond all bounds till inundation rise
1	above the highest hills then shall this mount
1	of paradise by might of waves be moovd
1	out of his place pushd by the horned floud 
1	with all his verdure spoil d and trees adrift
1	down the great river to the op ning gulf 
1	and there take root an iland salt and bare 
1	the haunt of seales and orcs and sea mews clang 
1	to teach thee that god attributes to place
1	no sanctitie if none be thither brought
1	by men who there frequent or therein dwell 
1	and now what further shall ensue behold 
1	he lookd and saw the ark hull on the floud 
1	which now abated for the clouds were fled 
1	drivn by a keen north winde that blowing drie
1	wrinkl d the face of deluge as decai d 
1	and the cleer sun on his wide watrie glass
1	gaz d hot and of the fresh wave largely drew 
1	as after thirst which made thir flowing shrink
1	from standing lake to tripping ebbe that stole
1	with soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt
1	his sluces as the heav n his windows shut 
1	the ark no more now flotes but seems on ground
1	fast on the top of som high mountain fixt 
1	and now the tops of hills as rocks appeer 
1	with clamor thence the rapid currents drive
1	towards the retreating sea thir furious tyde 
1	forthwith from out the arke a raven flies 
1	and after him the surer messenger 
1	a dove sent forth once and agen to spie
1	green tree or ground whereon his foot may light 
1	the second time returning in his bill
1	an olive leafe he brings pacific signe 
1	anon drie ground appeers and from his arke
1	the ancient sire descends with all his train 
1	then with uplifted hands and eyes devout 
1	grateful to heav n over his head beholds
1	a dewie cloud and in the cloud a bow
1	conspicuous with three lifted colours gay 
1	betok ning peace from god and cov nant new 
1	whereat the heart of adam erst so sad
1	greatly rejoyc d and thus his joy broke forth 
1	o thou that future things canst represent
1	as present heav nly instructer i revive
1	at this last sight assur d that man shall live
1	with all the creatures and thir seed preserve 
1	farr less i now lament for one whole world
1	of wicked sons destroyd then i rejoyce
1	for one man found so perfet and so just 
1	that god voutsafes to raise another world
1	from him and all his anger to forget 
1	but say what mean those colourd streaks in heavn 
1	distended as the brow of god appeas d 
1	or serve they as a flourie verge to binde
1	the fluid skirts of that same watrie cloud 
1	least it again dissolve and showr the earth 
1	to whom th archangel dextrously thou aim st 
1	so willingly doth god remit his ire 
1	though late repenting him of man deprav d 
1	griev d at his heart when looking down he saw
1	the whole earth fill d with violence and all flesh
1	corrupting each thir way yet those remoov d 
1	such grace shall one just man find in his sight 
1	that he relents not to blot out mankind 
1	and makes a covenant never to destroy
1	the earth again by flood nor let the sea
1	surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world
1	with man therein or beast but when he brings
1	over the earth a cloud will therein set
1	his triple colour d bow whereon to look
1	and call to mind his cov nant day and night 
1	seed time and harvest heat and hoary frost
1	shall hold thir course till fire purge all things new 
1	both heav n and earth wherein the just shall dwell 
1	daemoniac phrenzie moaping melancholie
1	and moon struck madness pining atrophie 
1	marasmus and wide wasting pestilence 
1	my dissolution michael repli d 
1	though bent on speed so heer the archangel paus d
1	betwixt the world destroy d and world restor d 
1	if adam aught perhaps might interpose 
1	then with transition sweet new speech resumes 
1	thus thou hast seen one world begin and end 
1	and man as from a second stock proceed 
1	much thou hast yet to see but i perceave
1	thy mortal sight to faile objects divine
1	must needs impaire and wearie human sense 
1	henceforth what is to com i will relate 
1	thou therefore give due audience and attend 
1	this second sours of men while yet but few 
1	and while the dread of judgement past remains
1	fresh in thir mindes fearing the deitie 
1	with some regard to what is just and right
1	shall lead thir lives and multiplie apace 
1	labouring the soile and reaping plenteous crop 
1	corn wine and oyle and from the herd or flock 
1	oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid 
1	with large wine offerings pour d and sacred feast
1	shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam d and dwell
1	long time in peace by families and tribes
1	under paternal rule till one shall rise
1	of proud ambitious heart who not content
1	with fair equalitie fraternal state 
1	will arrogate dominion undeserv d
1	over his brethren and quite dispossess
1	concord and law of nature from the earth 
1	hunting and men not beasts shall be his game 
1	with warr and hostile snare such as refuse
1	subjection to his empire tyrannous 
1	a mightie hunter thence he shall be styl d
1	before the lord as in despite of heav n 
1	or from heav n claming second sovrantie 
1	and from rebellion shall derive his name 
1	though of rebellion others he accuse 
1	hee with a crew whom like ambition joyns
1	with him or under him to tyrannize 
1	marching from eden towards the west shall finde
1	the plain wherein a black bituminous gurge
1	boiles out from under ground the mouth of hell 
1	of brick and of that stuff they cast to build
1	a citie towre whose top may reach to heav n 
1	and get themselves a name least far disperst
1	in foraign lands thir memorie be lost 
1	regardless whether good or evil fame 
1	but god who oft descends to visit men
1	unseen and through thir habitations walks
1	to mark thir doings them beholding soon 
1	comes down to see thir citie ere the tower
1	obstruct heav n towrs and in derision sets
1	upon thir tongues a various spirit to rase
1	quite out thir native language and instead
1	to sow a jangling noise of words unknown 
1	forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud

1	this yet i apprehend not why to those
1	among whom god will deigne to dwell on earth
1	so many and so various laws are giv n 
1	so many laws argue so many sins
1	among them how can god with such reside 
1	to whom thus michael doubt not but that sin
1	will reign among them as of thee begot 
1	and therefore was law given them to evince
1	thir natural pravitie by stirring up
1	sin against law to fight that when they see
1	law can discover sin but not remove 
1	save by those shadowie expiations weak 
1	the bloud of bulls and goats they may conclude
1	some bloud more precious must be paid for man 
1	just for unjust that in such righteousness
1	to them by faith imputed they may finde
1	justification towards god and peace
1	of conscience which the law by ceremonies
1	cannot appease nor man the moral part
1	perform and not performing cannot live 
1	so law appears imperfet and but giv n
1	with purpose to resign them in full time

1	from shadowie types to truth from flesh to spirit 
1	from imposition of strict laws to free
1	acceptance of large grace from servil fear
1	to filial works of law to works of faith 
1	and therefore shall not moses though of god
1	highly belov d being but the minister
1	of law his people into canaan lead 
1	but joshua whom the gentiles jesus call 
1	his name and office bearing who shall quell
1	the adversarie serpent and bring back
1	through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man
1	safe to eternal paradise of rest 
1	meanwhile they in thir earthly canaan plac t
1	long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins
1	national interrupt thir public peace 
1	provoking god to raise them enemies 
1	from whom as oft he saves them penitent
1	by judges first then under kings of whom
1	the second both for pietie renownd

1	men who attend the altar and should most
1	endeavour peace thir strife pollution brings
1	upon the temple it self at last they seise

1	barr d of his right yet at his birth a starr
1	unseen before in heav n proclaims him com 
1	and guides the eastern sages who enquire

1	o prophet of glad tidings finisher

1	why our great expectation should be call d
1	the seed of woman virgin mother haile 
1	high in the love of heav n yet from my loynes
1	thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son
1	of god most high so god with man unites 
1	needs must the serpent now his capital bruise
1	expect with mortal paine say where and when
1	thir fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel 
1	to whom thus michael dream not of thir fight 
1	as of a duel or the local wounds
1	of head or heel not therefore joynes the son

1	thy enemie nor so is overcome
1	satan whose fall from heav n a deadlier bruise 
1	disabl d not to give thee thy deaths wound 
1	which hee who comes thy saviour shall recure 
1	not by destroying satan but his works
1	in thee and in thy seed nor can this be 
1	but by fulfilling that which thou didst want 
1	obedience to the law of god impos d
1	on penaltie of death and suffering death 
1	the penaltie to thy transgression due 
1	and due to theirs which out of thine will grow 
1	so onely can high justice rest appaid 
1	the law of god exact he shall fulfill
1	both by obedience and by love though love
1	alone fulfill the law thy punishment
1	he shall endure by coming in the flesh
1	to a reproachful life and cursed death 
1	proclaiming life to all who shall believe
1	in his redemption and that his obedience
1	imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
1	to save them not thir own though legal works 
1	for this he shall live hated be blasphem d 
1	seis d on by force judg d and to death condemnd
1	a shameful and accurst naild to the cross

1	but to the cross he nailes thy enemies 
1	the law that is against thee and the sins
1	of all mankinde with him there crucifi d 
1	never to hurt them more who rightly trust
1	in this his satisfaction so he dies 
1	but soon revives death over him no power
1	shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
1	returne the starres of morn shall see him rise
1	out of his grave fresh as the dawning light 
1	thy ransom paid which man from death redeems 
1	his death for man as many as offerd life
1	neglect not and the benefit imbrace
1	by faith not void of works this god like act
1	annuls thy doom the death thou shouldst have dy d 
1	in sin for ever lost from life this act
1	shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength
1	defeating sin and death his two maine armes 
1	and fix farr deeper in his head thir stings
1	then temporal death shall bruise the victors heel 
1	or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep 
1	a gentle wafting to immortal life 
1	nor after resurrection shall he stay
1	longer on earth then certaine times to appeer
1	still follow d him to them shall leave in charge
1	to teach all nations what of him they learn d
1	and his salvation them who shall beleeve
1	baptizing in the profluent streame the signe

1	pure and in mind prepar d if so befall

1	all nations they shall teach for from that day
1	not onely to the sons of abrahams loines
1	salvation shall be preacht but to the sons
1	of abrahams faith wherever through the world 
1	so in his seed all nations shall be blest 
1	then to the heav n of heav ns he shall ascend
1	with victory triumphing through the aire
1	over his foes and thine there shall surprise
1	the serpent prince of aire and drag in chaines
1	through all his realme there confounded leave 
1	then enter into glory and resume
1	his seat at gods right hand exalted high
1	above all names in heav n and thence shall come 
1	when this worlds dissolution shall be ripe 
1	with glory and power to judge both quick dead 
1	to judge th unfaithful dead but to reward
1	his faithful and receave them into bliss 
1	whether in heav n or earth for then the earth
1	shall all be paradise far happier place
1	then this of eden and far happier daies 
1	so spake th archangel michael then paus d 
1	as at the worlds great period and our sire
1	replete with joy and wonder thus repli d 
1	o goodness infinite goodness immense 
1	that all this good of evil shall produce 
1	and evil turn to good more wonderful
1	then that which by creation first brought forth
1	light out of darkness full of doubt i stand 
1	whether i should repent me now of sin
1	by mee done and occasiond or rejoyce
1	much more that much more good thereof shall spring 
1	to god more glory more good will to men
1	from god and over wrauth grace shall abound 
1	but say if our deliverer up to heav n
1	must reascend what will betide the few
1	his faithful left among th unfaithful herd 
1	the enemies of truth who then shall guide
1	his people who defend will they not deale
1	wors with his followers then with him they dealt 
1	be sure they will said th angel but from heav n
1	hee to his own a comforter will send 
1	the promise of the father who shall dwell
1	his spirit within them and the law of faith
1	working through love upon thir hearts shall write 
1	to guide them in all truth and also arme
1	with spiritual armour able to resist
1	satans assaults and quench his fierie darts
1	what man can do against them not affraid 
1	though to the death against such cruelties
1	with inward consolations recompenc t 
1	and oft supported so as shall amaze
1	thir proudest persecuters for the spirit
1	powrd first on his apostles whom he sends
1	to evangelize the nations then on all
1	baptiz d shall them with wondrous gifts endue
1	to speak all tongues and do all miracles 
1	as did thir lord before them thus they win
1	great numbers of each nation to receave
1	with joy the tidings brought from heav n at length
1	thir ministry perform d and race well run 
1	thir doctrine and thir story written left 
1	they die but in thir room as they forewarne 
1	wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves 
1	who all the sacred mysteries of heav n
1	to thir own vile advantages shall turne
1	of lucre and ambition and the truth
1	with superstitions and traditions taint 
1	left onely in those written records pure 
1	though not but by the spirit understood 
1	then shall they seek to avail themselves of names 
1	places and titles and with these to joine
1	secular power though feigning still to act
1	by spiritual to themselves appropriating
1	the spirit of god promisd alike and giv n
1	to all beleevers and from that pretense 
1	spiritual lawes by carnal power shall force
1	on every conscience laws which none shall finde
1	left them inrould or what the spirit within
1	shall on the heart engrave what will they then
1	but force the spirit of grace it self and binde
1	his consort libertie what but unbuild
1	his living temples built by faith to stand 
1	thir own faith not anothers for on earth
1	who against faith and conscience can be heard
1	infallible yet many will presume 
1	whence heavie persecution shall arise
1	on all who in the worship persevere
1	of spirit and truth the rest farr greater part 
1	will deem in outward rites and specious formes
1	religion satisfi d truth shall retire
1	bestuck with slandrous darts and works of faith
1	rarely be found so shall the world goe on 
1	to good malignant to bad men benigne 
1	under her own waight groaning till the day
1	appeer of respiration to the just 
1	and vengeance to the wicked at return
1	of him so lately promis d to thy aid 
1	the womans seed obscurely then foretold 
1	now amplier known thy saviour and thy lord 
1	last in the clouds from heav n to be reveald
1	in glory of the father to dissolve

1	new heav ns new earth ages of endless date
1	founded in righteousness and peace and love

1	he ended and thus adam last reply d 
1	how soon hath thy prediction seer blest 
1	measur d this transient world the race of time 
1	till time stand fixt beyond is all abyss 
1	eternitie whose end no eye can reach 
1	greatly instructed i shall hence depart 
1	greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
1	of knowledge what this vessel can containe 
1	beyond which was my folly to aspire 
1	henceforth i learne that to obey is best 
1	and love with feare the onely god to walk
1	as in his presence ever to observe
1	his providence and on him sole depend 
1	merciful over all his works with good
1	still overcoming evil and by small
1	accomplishing great things by things deemd weak
1	subverting worldly strong and worldly wise
1	by simply meek that suffering for truths sake
1	is fortitude to highest victorie 
1	and to the faithful death the gate of life 
1	taught this by his example whom i now
1	acknowledge my redeemer ever blest 
1	to whom thus also th angel last repli d 
1	this having learnt thou hast attaind the summe
1	of wisdom hope no higher though all the starrs
1	thou knewst by name and all th ethereal powers

1	a paradise within thee happier farr 
1	let us descend now therefore from this top
1	of speculation for the hour precise
1	exacts our parting hence and see the guards 
1	by mee encampt on yonder hill expect
1	thir motion at whose front a flaming sword

1	we may no longer stay go waken eve

1	to meek submission thou at season fit
1	let her with thee partake what thou hast heard

1	the great deliverance by her seed to come
1	that ye may live which will be many dayes 
1	both in one faith unanimous though sad 
1	with cause for evils past yet much more cheer d
1	with meditation on the happie end 
1	he ended and they both descend the hill 
1	descended adam to the bowre where eve
1	lay sleeping ran before but found her wak t

1	whence thou returnst whither wentst i know 
1	for god is also in sleep and dreams advise 
1	which he hath sent propitious some great good
1	presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress
1	wearied i fell asleep but now lead on 
1	in mee is no delay with thee to goe

0	i swayed upon the gaudy stern
0	the butt end of a steering oar 
0	and everywhere that i could turn
0	men ran upon the shore 
0	and though i would have hushed the crowd
0	there was no mother s son but said 
0	 what is the figure in a shroud
0	upon a gaudy bed 
0	and fishes bubbling to the brim
0	cried out upon that thing beneath 
0	it had such dignity of limb 
0	by the sweet name of death 
0	though i d my finger on my lip 
0	what could i but take up the song 
0	and fish and crowd and gaudy ship
0	cried out the whole night long 
0	crying amid the glittering sea 
0	naming it with ecstatic breath 
0	because it had such dignity
0	by the sweet name of death 
0	if any man drew near
0	when i was young 
0	i thought he holds her dear 
0	and shook with hate and fear 
0	but oh twas bitter wrong
0	if he could pass her by
0	with an indifferent eye 
0	whereon i wrote and wrought 
0	and now being gray 
0	i dream that i have brought
0	to such a pitch my thought
0	that coming time can say 
0	 he shadowed in a glass
0	what thing her body was 
0	for she had fiery blood
0	when i was young 
0	and trod so sweetly proud
0	as twere upon a cloud 
0	a woman homer sung 
0	that life and letters seem
0	but an heroic dream 
0	she lived in storm and strife 
0	her soul had such desire
0	for what proud death may bring
0	that it could not endure
0	the common good of life 
0	but lived as twere a king
0	that packed his marriage day
0	with banneret and pennon 
0	trumpet and kettledrum 
0	and the outrageous cannon 
0	to bundle time away
0	that the night come 
0	i had this thought awhile ago 
0	 my darling cannot understand
0	what i have done or what would do
0	in this blind bitter land 
0	and i grew weary of the sun
0	until my thoughts cleared up again 
0	remembering that the best i have done
0	was done to make it plain 
0	that every year i have cried at length
0	my darling understands it all 
0	because i have come into my strength 
0	and words obey my call 
0	that had she done so who can say
0	what would have shaken from the sieve 
0	i might have thrown poor words away
0	and been content to live 
0	now must i these three praise 
0	three women that have wrought
0	what joy is in my days 
0	one that no passing thought 
0	nor those unpassing cares 
0	no not in these fifteen
0	many times troubled years 
0	could ever come between
0	heart and delighted heart 
0	and one because her hand
0	had strength that could unbind
0	what none can understand 
0	what none can have and thrive 
0	youth s dreamy load till she
0	so changed me that i live
0	labouring in ecstasy 
0	and what of her that took
0	all till my youth was gone
0	with scarce a pitying look 
0	how should i praise that one 
0	when day begins to break
0	i count my good and bad 
0	being wakeful for her sake 
0	remembering what she had 
0	what eagle look still shows 
0	while up from my heart s root
0	so great a sweetness flows
0	i shake from head to foot 
0	why should i blame her that she filled my days
0	with misery or that she would of late
0	have taught to ignorant men most violent ways 
0	or hurled the little streets upon the great 
0	had they but courage equal to desire 
0	what could have made her peaceful with a mind
0	that nobleness made simple as a fire 
0	with beauty like a tightened bow a kind
0	that is not natural in an age like this 
0	being high and solitary and most stern 
0	why what could she have done being what she is 
0	was there another troy for her to burn 
0	some may have blamed you that you took away
0	the verses that could move them on the day
0	when the ears being deafened the sight of the eyes blind
0	with lightning you went from me and i could find
0	nothing to make a song about but kings 
0	helmets and swords and half forgotten things
0	that were like memories of you but now
0	we ll out for the world lives as long ago 
0	and while we re in our laughing weeping fit 
0	hurl helmets crowns and swords into the pit 
0	but dear cling close to me since you were gone 
0	my barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone 
0	 would it were anything but merely voice 
0	the no king cried who after that was king 
0	because he had not heard of anything
0	that balanced with a word is more than noise 
0	yet old romance being kind let him prevail
0	somewhere or somehow that i have forgot 
0	though he d but cannon whereas we that had thought
0	to have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
0	have been defeated by that pledge you gave
0	in momentary anger long ago 
0	and i that have not your faith how shall i know
0	that in the blinding light beyond the grave
0	we ll find so good a thing as that we have lost 
0	the hourly kindness the day s common speech 
0	the habitual content of each with each
0	when neither soul nor body has been crossed 
0	suddenly i saw the cold and rook delighting heaven
0	that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice 
0	and thereupon imagination and heart were driven
0	so wild that every casual thought of that and this
0	vanished and left but memories that should be out of season
0	with the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago 
0	and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason 
0	until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro 
0	riddled with light ah when the ghost begins to quicken 
0	confusion of the death bed over is it sent
0	out naked on the roads as the books say and stricken
0	by the injustice of the skies for punishment 
0	ah that time could touch a form
0	that could show what homer s age
0	bred to be a hero s wage 
0	 were not all her life but storm 
0	would not painters paint a form
0	of such noble lines i said 
0	 such a delicate high head 
0	so much sternness and such charm 
0	till they had changed us to like strength 
0	ah but peace that comes at length 
0	came when time had touched her form 
0	o heart be at peace because
0	nor knave nor dolt can break
0	what s not for their applause 
0	being for a woman s sake 
0	enough if the work has seemed 
0	so did she your strength renew 
0	a dream that a lion had dreamed
0	till the wilderness cried aloud 
0	a secret between you two 
0	between the proud and the proud 
0	what still you would have their praise 
0	but here s a haughtier text 
0	the labyrinth of her days
0	that her own strangeness perplexed 
0	and how what her dreaming gave
0	earned slander ingratitude 
0	from self same dolt and knave 
0	aye and worse wrong than these 
0	yet she singing upon her road 
0	half lion half child is at peace 
0	the fascination of what s difficult
0	has dried the sap out of my veins and rent
0	spontaneous joy and natural content
0	out of my heart there s something ails our colt
0	that must as if it had not holy blood 
0	nor on an olympus leaped from cloud to cloud 
0	 all rights reserved 
0	shiver under the lash strain sweat and jolt
0	as though it dragged road metal my curse on plays
0	that have to be set up in fifty ways 
0	on the day s war with every knave and dolt 
0	theatre business management of men 
0	i swear before the dawn comes round again
0	i ll find the stable and pull out the bolt 
0	wine comes in at the mouth
0	and love comes in at the eye 
0	that s all we shall know for truth
0	before we grow old and die 
0	i lift the glass to my mouth 
0	i look at you and i sigh 
0	though leaves are many the root is one 
0	through all the lying days of my youth
0	i swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun 
0	now i may wither into the truth 
0	where where but here have pride and truth 
0	that long to give themselves for wage 
0	to shake their wicked sides at youth
0	restraining reckless middle age 
0	you say as i have often given tongue
0	in praise of what another s said or sung 
0	 twere politic to do the like by these 
0	but where s the wild dog that has praised his fleas 
0	once when midnight smote the air 
0	eunuchs ran through hell and met
0	round about hell s gate to stare
0	at great juan riding by 
0	and like these to rail and sweat 
0	maddened by that sinewy thigh 
0	 put off that mask of burning gold
0	with emerald eyes 
0	 o no my dear you make so bold
0	to find if hearts be wild and wise 
0	and yet not cold 
0	 i would but find what s there to find 
0	love or deceit 
0	 it was the mask engaged your mind 
0	and after set your heart to beat 
0	not what s behind 
0	 but lest you are my enemy 
0	i must enquire 
0	 o no my dear let all that be 
0	what matter so there is but fire
0	in you in me 
0	how should the world be luckier if this house 
0	where passion and precision have been one
0	time out of mind became too ruinous
0	to breed the lidless eye that loves the sun 
0	and the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow
0	where wings have memory of wings and all
0	that comes of the best knit to the best although
0	mean roof trees were the sturdier for its fall 
0	how should their luck run high enough to reach
0	the gifts that govern men and after these
0	to gradual time s last gift a written speech
0	wrought of high laughter loveliness and ease 
0	 imitated from ronsard 
0	dear craoibhin aoibhin look into our case 
0	when we are high and airy hundreds say
0	that if we hold that flight they ll leave the place 
0	while those same hundreds mock another day
0	because we have made our art of common things 
0	so bitterly you d dream they longed to look
0	all their lives through into some drift of wings 
0	you ve dandled them and fed them from the book
0	and know them to the bone impart to us 
0	we ll keep the secret a new trick to please 
0	is there a bridle for this proteus
0	that turns and changes like his draughty seas 
0	or is there none most popular of men 
0	but when they mock us that we mock again 
0	these are the clouds about the fallen sun 
0	the majesty that shuts his burning eye 
0	the weak lay hand on what the strong has done 
0	till that be tumbled that was lifted high
0	and discord follow upon unison 
0	and all things at one common level lie 
0	and therefore friend if your great race were run
0	and these things came so much the more thereby
0	have you made greatness your companion 
0	although it be for children that you sigh 
0	these are the clouds about the fallen sun 
0	the majesty that shuts his burning eye 
0	out yonder where the race course is 
0	delight makes all of the one mind 
0	riders upon the swift horses 
0	the field that closes in behind 
0	we too had good attendance once 
0	hearers and hearteners of the work 
0	aye horsemen for companions 
0	before the merchant and the clerk
0	breathed on the world with timid breath 
0	sing on sometime and at some new moon 
0	we ll learn that sleeping is not death 
0	hearing the whole earth change its tune 
0	its flesh being wild and it again
0	crying aloud as the race course is 
0	and we find hearteners among men
0	that ride upon horses 
0	sickness brought me this
0	thought in that scale of his 
0	why should i be dismayed
0	though flame had burned the whole
0	world as it were a coal 
0	now i have seen it weighed
0	against a soul 
0	all things can tempt me from this craft of verse 
0	one time it was a woman s face or worse 
0	the seeming needs of my fool driven land 
0	now nothing but comes readier to the hand
0	than this accustomed toil when i was young 
0	i had not given a penny for a song
0	did not the poet sing it with such airs
0	that one believed he had a sword upstairs 
0	yet would be now could i but have my wish 
0	i whispered i am too young 
0	and then i am old enough 
0	wherefore i threw a penny
0	to find out if i might love 
0	 go and love go and love young man 
0	if the lady be young and fair 
0	ah penny brown penny brown penny 
0	i am looped in the loops of her hair 
0	oh love is the crooked thing 
0	there is nobody wise enough
0	to find out all that is in it 
0	for he would be thinking of love
0	till the stars had run away 
0	and the shadows eaten the moon 
0	ah penny brown penny brown penny

0	tables and flagons black with a slight purple tinge which is not
0	characters except the red man and the black men are dressed in
0	various shades of green one or two with touches of purple which
0	a cat headed man out of connaught go pacing and spitting by 
0	but that could not be 
0	you have dreamed it there s nothing out there 
0	and then i danced on their graves and carried away their hoard 
0	does anything stir on the sea 
0	not even a fish or a gull 
0	i can see for a mile or two now that the moon s at the full 
0	ah there there is someone who calls us 
0	but from the landward side 
0	and we have nothing to fear that has not come up from the tide 
0	the rocks and the bushes cover whoever made that noise 
0	but the land will do us no harm 
0	it was like cuchulain s voice 
0	but that s an impossible thing 
0	an impossible thing indeed 
0	for he will never come home he has all that he could need
0	in that high windy scotland good luck in all that he does 
0	here neighbour wars on neighbour and why there is no man knows 
0	and if a man is lucky all wish his luck away 
0	and take his good name from him between a day and a day 
0	i would he d come for all that and make his young wife know
0	that though she may be his wife she has no right to go
0	before your wife and my wife as she would have gone last night
0	had they not caught at her dress and pulled her as was right 
0	and she makes light of us though our wives do all that they can 
0	she spreads her tail like a peacock and praises none but her man 
0	a man in a long green cloak that covers him up to the chin
0	comes down through the rocks and hazels 
0	cry out that he cannot come in 
0	no man on the ridge of the world must ever know that but us two 
0	go away go away go away 
0	i will go when the night is through
0	and i have eaten and slept and drunk to my heart s delight 
0	a law has been made that none shall sleep in this house to night 
0	who made that law 
0	we made it and who has so good a right 
0	who else has to keep the house from the shape changers till day 
0	then i will unmake the law so get you out of the way 
0	i thought that no living man could have pushed me from the door 
0	nor could any living man do it but for the dip in the floor 
0	and had i been rightly ready there s no man living could do it 
0	dip or no dip 
0	go out if you have your wits go out 
0	a stone s throw further on you will find a big house where
0	our wives will give you supper and you ll sleep sounder there 
0	for it s a luckier house 
0	i ll eat and sleep where i will 
0	go out or i will make you 
0	not till i have drunk my fill 
0	but may some dog defend me for a cat of wonder s up 
0	laegaire and conall are here the flagon full to the top 
0	and the cups 
0	the cups are dry as a bone 
0	go into scotland again or where you will but begone
0	from this unlucky country that was made when the devil spat 
0	i am losing patience conall i find you stuffed with pride 
0	the flagon full to the brim the front door standing wide 
0	you d put me off with words but the whole thing s plain enough 
0	you are waiting for some message to bring you to war or love
0	in that old secret country beyond the wool white waves 
0	or it may be down beneath them in foam bewildered caves
0	where nine forsaken sea queens fling shuttles to and fro 
0	but beyond them or beneath them whether you will or no 
0	i am going too 
0	better tell it all out to the end 
0	he was born to luck in the cradle his good luck may amend
0	the bad luck we were born to 
0	i ll lay the whole thing bare 
0	you saw the luck that he had when he pushed in past me there 
0	does anything stir on the sea 
0	not even a fish or a gull 
0	when a wide high man came in with a red foxy cloak 
0	with half shut foxy eyes and a great laughing mouth 
0	and he said when we bid him drink that he had so great a drouth
0	he could drink the sea 
0	i thought he had come from one of you
0	out of some connaught rath and would lap up milk and mew 
0	but if he so loved water i have the tale awry 
0	you would not be so merry if he were standing by 
0	for when we had sung or danced as he were our next of kin
0	he promised to show us a game the best that ever had been 
0	 a head for a head he said that is the game that i play 
0	how could he whip off a head when his own had been whipped away 
0	we told him it over and over and that ale had fuddled his wit 
0	and there on the ground where it fell it went on laughing at me 
0	till he took it up in his hands 
0	and splashed himself into the sea 
0	i have imagined as good when i ve been as deep in the cup 
0	you never did 
0	and believed it 
0	cuchulain when will you stop
0	boasting of your great deeds and weighing yourself with us two 
0	and crying out to the world whatever we say or do 
0	that you ve said or done a better nor is it a drunkard s tale 
0	swore we should keep it secret 
0	but twelve months upon the clock 
0	a twelvemonth from the first time 
0	and the jug full up to the brim 
0	for we had been put from our drinking by the very thought of him 
0	we stood as we re standing now 
0	the horns were as empty 
0	he ran up out of the sea with his head on his shoulders again 
0	why this is a tale worth telling 
0	and he called for his debt and his right 
0	what is there to be said
0	when a man with a right to get it has come to ask for your head 
0	if you had been sitting there you had been silent like us 
0	he would have followed after if we had run away 
0	will he tell every mother s son that we have broken our word 
0	whether he does or does not we ll drive him out with the sword 
0	and take his life in the bargain if he but dare to scoff 
0	or a man that can pick it up and carry it out in his hand 
0	he is coming now there s a splash and a rumble along the strand
0	as when he came last 
0	come and put all your backs to the door 
0	it is too late to shut it for there he stands once more
0	and laughs like the sea 
0	old herring you whip off heads why then
0	whip off your own for it seems you can clap it on again 
0	or else go down in the sea go down in the sea i say 
0	find that old juggler manannan and whip his head away 
0	or the red man of the boyne for they are of your own sort 
0	or if the waves have vexed you and you would find a sport
0	of a more irish fashion go fight without a rest
0	a caterwauling phantom among the winds of the west 
0	but what are you waiting for into the water i say 
0	if there s no sword can harm you i ve an older trick to play 
0	an old five fingered trick to tumble you out of the place 
0	i am sualtim s son cuchulain what do you laugh in my face 
0	so you too think me in earnest in wagering poll for poll 
0	a drinking joke and a gibe and a juggler s feat that is all 
0	to make the time go quickly for i am the drinker s friend 
0	the kindest of all shape changers from here to the world s end 
0	the best of all tipsy companions and now i bring you a gift 
0	and wear upon his own head and choose for yourselves the best 
0	there i m forgiven now 
0	let the bravest take it up 
0	laegaire is best 
0	between water and hill 
0	he fought in the west
0	with cat heads until
0	at the break of day
0	all fell by his sword 
0	and he carried away
0	their hidden hoard 
0	give it me for what did you find in the bag
0	but the straw and the broken delf and the bits of dirty rag
0	you d taken for good money 
0	no no but give it me 
0	the helmet s mine or laegaire s you re the youngest of us three 
0	i did not take it to keep it the red man gave it for one 
0	but i shall give it to all to all of us three or to none 
0	that is as you look upon it we will pass it to and fro 
0	and time and time about drink out of it and so
0	stroke into peace this cat that has come to take our lives 
0	now it is purring again and now i drink to your wives 
0	and i drink to emer my wife 
0	why what in god s name is that noise 
0	what else but the charioteers and the kitchen and stable boys
0	shouting against each other and the worst of all is your own 
0	that chariot driver laeg and they ll keep it up till the dawn 
0	there do you hear them now such hatred has each for each
0	they have taken the hunting horns to drown one other s speech
0	they carry great horns ladles and the like 
0	i am laeg cuchulain s driver and my master s cock of the yard 
0	conall would scatter his feathers 
0	no use they won t hear a word 
0	they ll keep it up till the dawn 
0	it is laegaire that is the best 
0	for he fought with cats in connaught while conall took his rest
0	and drained his ale pot 
0	laegaire what does a man of his sort
0	care for the like of us he did it for his own sport 
0	it was all mere luck at the best 
0	but conall i say 
0	let me speak 
0	before your cock was born my master was in the fight 
0	conall has got it the best man has got it and i am his man 
0	who was it started this quarrel 
0	it was laeg done it all 
0	a high wide foxy man came where we sat in the hall 
0	getting our supper ready with a great voice like the wind 
0	and cried that there was a helmet or something of the kind 
0	that was for the foremost man upon the ridge of the earth 
0	so i cried your name through the hall 
0	but they denied its worth 
0	preferring laegaire or conall and they cried to drown my voice 
0	but i have so strong a throat that i drowned all their noise
0	till they took to the hunting horns and blew them into my face 
0	no conall is the best man here 
0	give it to laegaire that made the murderous cats pay dear 
0	it has been given to none that our rivalry might cease 
0	we have turned that murderous cat into a cup of peace 
0	i drank the first and then conall give it to laegaire now 
0	that it may purr in his hand and all of our servants know
0	that since the ale went in its claws went out of sight 
0	that s well i will stop my shouting 
0	cuchulain is in the right 
0	i am tired of this big horn that has made me hoarse as a rook 
0	cuchulain you drank the first 
0	by drinking the first he took
0	the whole of the honours himself 
0	cuchulain you drank the first 
0	if laegaire drink from it now he claims to be last and worst 
0	cuchulain and conall have drunk 
0	he is lost if he taste a drop 
0	that juggler from the sea that old red herring it is
0	who has set us all by the ears he brought the helmet for this 
0	and because we would not quarrel he ran elsewhere to shout
0	that conall and laegaire wronged me till all had fallen out 
0	who knows where he is now or who he is spurring to fight 
0	so get you gone and whatever may cry aloud in the night 
0	or show itself in the air be silent until morn 
0	cuchulain is in the right i am tired of this big horn 
0	mine is the better to look at 
0	but mine is better born 
0	my man is the pithier man 
0	old hurricane well done 
0	you ve set our wives to the game that they may egg us on 
0	we are to kill each other that you may sport with us 
0	no i have the right of place for i married the better man 
0	my nails in your neck and shoulder 
0	and go before me if you can 
0	my husband fought in the west 
0	but what did he fight with there
0	but sidelong and spitting and helpless shadows of the dim air 
0	and what did he carry away but straw and broken delf 
0	your own man made up that tale trembling alone by himself 
0	drowning his terror 
0	i am emer it is i go first through the door 
0	no one shall walk before me or praise any man before
0	my man has been praised 
0	come put an end to their quarrelling 
0	one is as fair as the other and each one the wife of a king 
0	break down the painted boards between the sill and the floor
0	that they come in together each one at her own door 
0	nothing that he has done 
0	his mind that is fire 
0	his body that is sun 
0	have set my head higher
0	than all the world s wives 
0	himself on the wind
0	is the gift that he gives 
0	therefore womenkind 
0	when their eyes have met mine 
0	grow cold and grow hot 
0	troubled as with wine
0	by a secret thought 
0	preyed upon fed upon
0	by jealousy and desire 
0	i am moon to that sun 
0	i am steel to that fire 
0	spear from the door and the three women come in at the same
0	cuchulain put off this sloth and awake 
0	a share of your honour 
0	you lie for your man would take from my man 
0	you say that you double face and your own husband began 
0	town land may rail at town land till all have gone to wrack 
0	the very straws may wrangle till they ve thrown down the stack 
0	the very door posts bicker till they ve pulled in the door 
0	the very ale jars jostle till the ale is on the floor 
0	but this shall help no further 
0	it was not for your head 
0	and so you would let none wear it but fling it away instead 
0	but you shall answer for it for you ve robbed my man by this 
0	you have robbed us both cuchulain 
0	the greatest wrong there is
0	on the wide ridge of the world has been done to us two this day 
0	who is for cuchulain i say 
0	deafen her singing with horns 
0	cry aloud blow horns make a noise 
0	blow horns clap hands or shout so that you smother her voice 
0	themselves there is a deafening noise and a confused fight 
0	coal black and headed like cats they came up over the strand 
0	and i saw one stretch to a torch and cover it with his hand 
0	another sooty fellow has plucked the moon from the air 
0	great sword 
0	i demand the debt that s owing let some man kneel down there
0	that i may cut his head off or all shall go to wrack 
0	so i will give him my head 
0	little wife little wife be at rest 
0	alive i have been far off in all lands under sun 
0	and been no faithful man but when my story is done
0	my fame shall spring up and laugh and set you high above all 
0	it is you not your fame that i love 
0	you are young you are wise you can call
0	some kinder and comelier man that will sit at home in the house 
0	live and be faithless still 
0	would you stay the great barnacle goose
0	i too on the grey wing s path 
0	do you dare do you dare do you dare 
0	bear children and sweep the house 
0	wail but keep from the road 
0	i have not come for your hurt i m the rector of this land 
0	and with my spitting cat heads my frenzied moon bred band 
0	age after age i sift it and choose for its championship
0	the man who hits my fancy 
0	and i choose the laughing lip
0	that shall not turn from laughing whatever rise or fall 
0	the heart that grows no bitterer although betrayed by all 
0	the hand that loves to scatter the life like a gambler s throw 
0	and these things i make prosper till a day come that i know 
0	thoughts upon the present state of the world
0	a new end for the king s threshold 
0	note on the new end to the king s threshold 
0	 tis all souls night and the great christ church bell 
0	and many a lesser bell sound through the room 
0	for it is now midnight 
0	and two long glasses brimmed with muscatel
0	bubble upon the table a ghost may come 
0	for it is a ghost s right 
0	his element is so fine
0	being sharpened by his death 
0	to drink from the wine breath
0	while our gross palates drink from the whole wine 
0	i need some mind that if the cannon sound
0	from every quarter of the world can stay
0	wound in mind s pondering 
0	as mummies in the mummy cloth are wound 
0	because i have a marvellous thing to say 
0	a certain marvellous thing
0	none but the living mock 
0	though not for sober ear 
0	it may be all that hear
0	should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock 
0	h s the first i call he loved strange thought
0	and knew that sweet extremity of pride
0	that s called platonic love 
0	and that to such a pitch of passion wrought
0	nothing could bring him when his lady died 
0	anodyne for his love 
0	words were but wasted breath 
0	one dear hope had he 
0	the inclemency
0	of that or the next winter would be death 
0	two thoughts were so mixed up i could not tell
0	whether of her or god he thought the most 
0	but think that his mind s eye 
0	when upward turned on one sole image fell 
0	and that a slight companionable ghost 
0	wild with divinity 
0	had so lit up the whole
0	immense miraculous house 
0	the bible promised us 
0	it seemed a gold fish swimming in a bowl 
0	on florence emery i call the next 
0	who finding the first wrinkles on a face
0	admired and beautiful 
0	and knowing that the future would be vexed
0	with minished beauty multiplied commonplace 
0	preferred to teach a school 
0	away from neighbour or friend
0	among dark skins and there
0	permit foul years to wear
0	hidden from eyesight to the unnoticed end 
0	before that end much had she ravelled out
0	from a discourse in figurative speech
0	by some learned indian
0	on the soul s journey how it is whirled about 
0	wherever the orbit of the moon can reach 
0	until it plunged into the sun 
0	and there free and yet fast 
0	being both chance and choice 
0	forget its broken toys
0	and sink into its own delight at last 
0	and i call up macgregor from the grave 
0	for in my first hard springtime we were friends 
0	although of late estranged 
0	and told him so but friendship never ends 
0	and what if mind seem changed 
0	and it seem changed with the mind 
0	when thoughts rise up unbid
0	on generous things that he did
0	and i grow half contented to be blind 
0	he had much industry at setting out 
0	much boisterous courage before loneliness
0	had driven him crazed 
0	for meditations upon unknown thought
0	make human intercourse grow less and less 
0	they are neither paid nor praised 
0	but he d object to the host 
0	the glass because my glass 
0	a ghost lover he was
0	and may have grown more arrogant being a ghost 
0	but names are nothing what matter who it be 
0	so that his elements have grown so fine
0	the fume of muscatel
0	can give his sharpened palate ecstasy
0	no living man can drink from the whole wine 
0	i have mummy truths to tell
0	whereat the living mock 
0	though not for sober ear 
0	for maybe all that hear
0	should laugh and weep an hour upon the clock 
0	such thought such thought have i that hold it tight
0	till meditation master all its parts 
0	nothing can stay my glance
0	until that glance run in the world s despite
0	to where the damned have howled away their hearts 
0	and where the blessed dance 
0	such thought that in it bound
0	i need no other thing
0	wound in mind s wandering 
0	as mummies in the mummy cloth are wound 
0	your hooves have stamped at the black margin of the wood 
0	even where the horrible green parrots call and swing 
0	my works are all stamped down into the sultry mud 
0	i knew that horse play knew it for a murderous thing 
0	what wholesome sun has ripened is wholesome food to eat
0	because of some green wing gathered old mummy wheat
0	in the mad abstract dark and ground it grain by grain
0	and after baked it slowly in an oven but now
0	i bring full flavoured wine out of a barrel found
0	where seven ephesian topers slept and never knew
0	when alexander s empire past they slept so sound 
0	stretch out your limbs and sleep a long saturnian sleep 
0	i have loved you better than my soul for all my words 
0	and there is none so fit to keep a watch and keep
0	unwearied eyes upon those horrible green birds 
0	many ingenious lovely things are gone
0	that seemed sheer miracle to the multitude 
0	above the murderous treachery of the moon
0	or all that wayward ebb and flow there stood
0	amid the ornamental bronze and stone
0	an ancient image made of olive wood 
0	and gone are phidias carven ivories
0	and all his golden grasshoppers and bees 
0	we too had many pretty toys when young 
0	a law indifferent to blame or praise
0	to bribe or threat habits that made old wrong
0	melt down as it were wax in the sun s rays 
0	public opinion ripening for so long
0	we thought it would outlive all future days 
0	o what fine thought we had because we thought
0	that the worst rogues and rascals had died out 
0	all teeth were drawn all ancient tricks unlearned 
0	and a great army but a showy thing 
0	what matter that no cannon had been turned
0	into a ploughshare parliament and king
0	thought that unless a little powder burned
0	the trumpeters might burst with trumpeting
0	and yet it lack all glory and perchance
0	the guardsmen s drowsy chargers would not prance 
0	now days are dragon ridden the nightmare
0	rides upon sleep a drunken soldiery
0	can leave the mother murdered at her door 
0	to crawl in her own blood and go scot free 
0	the night can sweat with terror as before
0	we pieced our thoughts into philosophy 
0	and planned to bring the world under a rule
0	who are but weasels fighting in a hole 
0	he who can read the signs nor sink unmanned
0	into the half deceit of some intoxicant
0	from shallow wits who knows no work can stand 
0	whether health wealth or peace of mind were spent
0	on master work of intellect or hand 
0	no honour leave its mighty monument 
0	has but one comfort left all triumph would
0	but break upon his ghostly solitude 
0	and other comfort were a bitter wound 
0	to be in love and love what vanishes 
0	greeks were but lovers all that country round
0	none dared admit if such a thought were his 
0	incendiary or bigot could be found
0	to burn that stump on the acropolis 
0	or break in bits the famous ivories
0	or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees 
0	when loie fuller s chinese dancers enwound
0	a shining web a floating ribbon of cloth 
0	it seemed that a dragon of air
0	had fallen among dancers had whirled them round
0	or hurried them off on its own furious path 
0	so the platonic year
0	whirls out new right and wrong
0	whirls in the old instead 
0	all men are dancers and their tread
0	goes to the barbarous clangour of gong 
0	some moralist or mythological poet
0	compares the solitary soul to a swan 
0	i am content with that 
0	contented that a troubled mirror show it
0	before that brief gleam of its life be gone 
0	an image of its state 
0	the wings half spread for flight 
0	the breast thrust out in pride
0	whether to play or to ride
0	those winds that clamour of approaching night 
0	a man in his own secret meditation
0	is lost amid the labyrinth that he has made
0	in art or politics 
0	some platonist affirms that in the station
0	where we should cast off body and trade
0	the ancient habit sticks 
0	and that if our works could
0	but vanish with our breath
0	that were a lucky death 
0	for triumph can but mar our solitude 
0	the swan has leaped into the desolate heaven 
0	that image can bring wildness bring a rage
0	to end all things to end
0	what my laborious life imagined even
0	the half imagined the half written page 
0	o but we dreamed to mend
0	whatever mischief seemed
0	to afflict mankind but now
0	that winds of winter blow
0	learn that we were crack pated when we dreamed 
0	we who seven years ago
0	talked of honour and of truth 
0	shriek with pleasure if we show
0	the weasel s twist the weasel s tooth 
0	come let us mock at the great
0	that had such burdens on the mind
0	and toiled so hard and late
0	to leave some monument behind 
0	nor thought of the levelling wind 
0	come let us mock at the wise 
0	with all those calendars whereon
0	they fixed old aching eyes 
0	they never saw how seasons run 
0	and now but gape at the sun 
0	come let us mock at the good
0	that fancied goodness might be gay 
0	grown tired of their solitude 
0	upon some brand new happy day 
0	wind shrieked and where are they 
0	mock mockers after that
0	that would not lift a hand maybe
0	to help good wise or great
0	to bar that foul storm out for we
0	traffic in mockery 
0	violence upon the roads violence of horses 
0	some few have handsome riders are garlanded
0	on delicate sensitive ear or tossing mane 
0	but wearied running round and round in their courses
0	all break and vanish and evil gathers head 
0	herodias daughters have returned again
0	a sudden blast of dusty wind and after
0	thunder of feet tumult of images 
0	their purpose in the labyrinth of the wind 
0	all turn with amorous cries or angry cries 
0	according to the wind for all are blind 
0	but now wind drops dust settles thereupon
0	there lurches past his great eyes without thought
0	under the shadow of stupid straw pale locks 
0	that insolent fiend robert artisson
0	to whom the love lorn lady kyteler brought
0	bronzed peacock feathers red combs of her cocks 
0	if you that have grown old were the first dead
0	neither caltapa tree nor scented lime
0	should hear my living feet nor would i tread
0	where we wrought that shall break the teeth of time 
0	let the new faces play what tricks they will
0	in the old rooms night can outbalance day 
0	our shadows rove the garden gravel still 
0	the living seem more shadowy than they 
0	bid a strong ghost stand at the head
0	that my michael may sleep sound 
0	nor cry nor turn in the bed
0	till his morning meal come round 
0	and may departing twilight keep
0	all dread afar till morning s back
0	that his mother may not lack
0	her fill of sleep 
0	bid the ghost have sword in hand 
0	there are malicious things although
0	few dream that they exist 
0	who have planned his murder for they know
0	of some most haughty deed or thought
0	that waits upon his future days 
0	and would through hatred of the bays
0	bring that to nought 
0	though you can fashion everything
0	from nothing every day and teach
0	the morning stars to sing 
0	you have lacked articulate speech
0	to tell your simplest want and known 
0	wailing upon a woman s knee 
0	all of that worst ignominy
0	of flesh and bone 
0	and when through all the town there ran
0	the servants of your enemy
0	a woman and a man 
0	unless the holy writings lie 
0	have borne you through the smooth and rough
0	and through the fertile and waste 
0	protecting till the danger past
0	with human love 
0	i am jealous of the looks men turn on you
0	for all men love your worth and i must rage
0	at my own image in the looking glass
0	that s so unlike myself that when you praise it
0	it is as though you praise another or even
0	mock me with praise of my mere opposite 
0	and when i wake towards morn i dread myself
0	for the heart cries that what deception wins
0	my cruelty must keep and so begone
0	if you have seen that image and not my worth 
0	all men have praised my strength but not my worth 
0	if you are no more strength than i am beauty
0	i will find out some cavern in the hills
0	and live among the ancient holy men 
0	for they at least have all men s reverence
0	and have no need of cruelty to keep
0	what no deception won 
0	i have heard them say
0	that men have reverence for their holiness
0	and not their worth 
0	god loves us for our worth 
0	but what care i that long for a man s love 
0	when my days that have
0	from cradle run to grave
0	from grave to cradle run instead 
0	when thoughts that a fool
0	has wound upon a spool
0	are but loose thread are but loose thread 
0	when cradle and spool are past
0	and i mere shade at last
0	coagulate of stuff
0	transparent like the wind 
0	i think that i may find
0	a faithful love a faithful love 
0	through winter time we call on spring 
0	and through the spring on summer call 
0	and when abounding hedges sing
0	declare that winter s best of all 
0	and after that there s nothing good
0	because the spring time has not come 
0	nor know that what disturbs our blood
0	is but its longing for the tomb 
0	die seanchan and proclaim the right of the poets 
0	come nearer me that i may know how face
0	differs from face and touch you with my hands 
0	o more than kin o more than children could be 
0	for children are but born out of our blood
0	and share our frailty o my chicks my chicks 
0	that i have nourished underneath my wings
0	and fed upon my soul he stands up and begins to walk
0	down steps i need no help 
0	he needs no help that joy has lifted up
0	like some miraculous beast out of ezekiel 
0	the man that dies has the chief part in the story 
0	and i will mock and mock and mock that image yonder
0	that evil picture in the sky no no 
0	i have all my strength again i will outface it 
0	o look upon the moon that s standing there
0	in the blue daylight notice her complexion
0	because it is the white of leprosy
0	and the contagion that afflicts mankind
0	falls from the moon when i and these are dead
0	we should be carried to some windy hill
0	to lie there with uncovered face awhile
0	that mankind and that leper there may know
0	dead faces laugh 
0	 he falls and then half rises 
0	king king dead faces laugh 
0	 he dies 
0	king king he is dead some strange triumphant thought
0	so filled his heart with joy that it has burst
0	being grown too mighty for our frailty 
0	and we who gaze grow like him and abhor
0	the moments that come between us and that death
0	you promised us 
0	take up his body 
0	go where you please and lay it where you please 
0	so that i cannot see his face or any
0	that cried him towards his death 
0	dead faces laugh 
0	the ancient right is gone the new remains
0	and that is death 
0	 they go towards the king holding out their halters 
0	we are impatient men 
0	so gather up the halters in your hands 
0	drive them away 
0	 he goes into the palace the soldiers block the way before
0	the pupils 
0	here is no place for you 
0	for he and his pretensions now are finished 
0	begone before the men at arms are bidden
0	to hurl you from the door 
0	take up his body
0	and cry that driven from the populous door
0	he seeks high waters and the mountain birds
0	to claim a portion of their solitude 
0	 they make a litter with cloak and staffs and lay seanchan
0	and cry that when they took his ancient right
0	they took all common sleep therefore he claims
0	the mountain for his mattress and his pillow 
0	and there he can sleep on not noticing
0	although the world be changed from worse to worse 
0	amid the changeless clamour of the curlew 
0	 they raise the litter on their shoulders and move a few steps 
0	 motioning to them to stop 
0	yet make triumphant music sing aloud
0	for coming times will bless what he has blessed
0	and curse what he has cursed 
0	no no be still 
0	or pluck a solemn music from the strings 
0	you wrong his greatness speaking so of triumph 
0	o silver trumpets be you lifted up
0	and cry to the great race that is to come 
0	long throated swans upon the waves of time
0	sing loudly for beyond the wall of the world
0	that race may hear our music and awake 
0	 motioning the musicians to lower their trumpets 
0	not what it leaves behind it in the light
0	but what it carries with it to the dark
0	exalts the soul nor song nor trumpet blast
0	can call up races from the worsening world
0	to mend the wrong and mar the solitude
0	of the great shade we follow to the tomb 
0	 fedelm and the pupils go out carrying the litter some play
0	a mournful music 
0	here ends seven poems and a fragment by william butler yeats 
0	nineteen hundred and twenty two 
0	hum in the lime tree flowers and put away
0	the unavailing outcries and the old bitterness
0	that empty the heart i have forgot awhile
0	tara uprooted and new commonness
0	upon the throne and crying about the streets
0	and hanging its paper flowers from post to post 
0	because it is alone of all things happy 
0	i am contented for i know that quiet
0	wanders laughing and eating her wild heart
0	among pigeons and bees while that great archer 
0	who but awaits his hour to shoot still hangs
0	a cloudy quiver over parc na lee 
0	maeve the great queen was pacing to and fro 
0	between the walls covered with beaten bronze 
0	in her high house at cruachan the long hearth 
0	flickering with ash and hazel but half showed
0	where the tired horse boys lay upon the rushes 
0	or on the benches underneath the walls 
0	in comfortable sleep all living slept
0	but that great queen who more than half the night
0	had paced from door to fire and fire to door 
0	though now in her old age in her young age
0	she had been beautiful in that old way
0	that s all but gone for the proud heart is gone
0	and the fool heart of the counting house fears all
0	but soft beauty and indolent desire 
0	she could have called over the rim of the world
0	whatever woman s lover had hit her fancy 
0	and yet had been great bodied and great limbed 
0	fashioned to be the mother of strong children 
0	and she d had lucky eyes and a high heart 
0	and wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax 
0	at need and made her beautiful and fierce 
0	sudden and laughing 
0	o unquiet heart 
0	why do you praise another praising her 
0	as if there were no tale but your own tale
0	worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound 
0	have i not bid you tell of that great queen
0	who has been buried some two thousand years 
0	when night was at its deepest a wild goose
0	cried from the porter s lodge and with long clamour
0	shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks 
0	but the horse boys slept on as though some power
0	had filled the house with druid heaviness 
0	and wondering who of the many changing sidhe
0	had come as in the old times to counsel her 
0	maeve walked yet with slow footfall being old 
0	to that small chamber by the outer gate 
0	the porter slept although he sat upright
0	with still and stony limbs and open eyes 
0	maeve waited and when that ear piercing noise
0	broke from his parted lips and broke again 
0	she laid a hand on either of his shoulders 
0	and shook him wide awake and bid him say
0	who of the wandering many changing ones
0	had troubled his sleep but all he had to say
0	was that the air being heavy and the dogs
0	more still than they had been for a good month 
0	he had fallen asleep and though he had dreamed nothing 
0	he could remember when he had had fine dreams 
0	it was before the time of the great war
0	she turned away he turned again to sleep
0	that no god troubled now and wondering
0	what matters were afoot among the sidhe 
0	maeve walked through that great hall and with a sigh
0	lifted the curtain of her sleeping room 
0	remembering that she too had seemed divine
0	to many thousand eyes and to her own
0	one that the generations had long waited
0	that work too difficult for mortal hands
0	might be accomplished bunching the curtain up
0	she saw her husband ailell sleeping there 
0	and thought of days when he d had a straight body 
0	and of that famous fergus nessa s husband 
0	who had been the lover of her middle life 
0	suddenly ailell spoke out of his sleep 
0	and not with his own voice or a man s voice 
0	but with the burning live unshaken voice
0	of those that it may be can never age 
0	he said high queen of cruachan and mag ai
0	a king of the great plain would speak with you 
0	and with glad voice maeve answered him what king
0	of the far wandering shadows has come to me 
0	as in the old days when they would come and go
0	about my threshold to counsel and to help 
0	the parted lips replied i seek your help 
0	for i am aengus and i am crossed in love 
0	 how may a mortal whose life gutters out
0	help them that wander with hand clasping hand
0	by rivers where nor rain nor hail has dimmed
0	their haughty images that cannot fade
0	although their beauty s like a hollow dream 
0	 i come from the undimmed rivers to bid you call
0	the children of the maines out of sleep 
0	and set them digging into anbual s hill 
0	we shadows while they uproot his earthy house 
0	will overthrow his shadows and carry off
0	caer his blue eyed daughter that i love 
0	i helped your fathers when they built these walls
0	and i would have your help in my great need 
0	queen of high cruachan 
0	 i obey your will
0	with speedy feet and a most thankful heart 
0	for you have been o aengus of the birds 
0	our giver of good counsel and good luck 
0	and with a groan as if the mortal breath
0	could but awaken sadly upon lips
0	that happier breath had moved her husband turned
0	face downward tossing in a troubled sleep 
0	but maeve and not with a slow feeble foot 
0	came to the threshold of the painted house 
0	where her grandchildren slept and cried aloud 
0	until the pillared dark began to stir
0	with shouting and the clang of unhooked arms 
0	she told them of the many changing ones 
0	and all that night and all through the next day
0	to middle night they dug into the hill 
0	at middle night great cats with silver claws 
0	bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls 
0	came up out of the hole and red eared hounds
0	with long white bodies came out of the air
0	suddenly and ran at them and harried them 
0	with quaking joints and terror strucken faces 
0	till maeve called out these are but common men 
0	casts up a show and the winds answer it
0	with holy shadows her high heart was glad 
0	and when the uproar ran along the grass
0	she followed with light footfall in the midst 
0	till it died out where an old thorn tree stood 
0	friend of these many years you too had stood
0	with equal courage in that whirling rout 
0	for you although you ve not her wandering heart 
0	have all that greatness and not hers alone 
0	for there is no high story about queens
0	in any ancient book but tells of you 
0	and when i ve heard how they grew old and died
0	or fell into unhappiness i ve said 
0	 she will grow old and die and she has wept 
0	and when i d write it out anew the words 
0	outrun the measure 
0	i d tell of that great queen
0	who stood amid a silence by the thorn
0	until two lovers came out of the air
0	with bodies made out of soft fire the one
0	about whose face birds wagged their fiery wings
0	said aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks
0	to maeve and to maeve s household owing all
0	in owing them the bride bed that gives peace 
0	then maeve o aengus master of all lovers 
0	a thousand years ago you held high talk
0	with the first kings of many pillared cruachan 
0	o when will you grow weary 
0	they had vanished 
0	but out of the dark air over her head there came
0	a murmur of soft words and meeting lips 
0	argument baile and aillinn were lovers but
0	aengus the master of love wishing them to be
0	happy in his own land among the dead told to
0	each a story of the other s death so that their
0	hearts were broken and they died 
0	i hardly hear the curlew cry 
0	nor the grey rush when wind is high 
0	before my thoughts begin to run
0	on the heir of ulad buan s son 
0	baile who had the honey mouth 
0	and that mild woman of the south 
0	aillinn who was king lugaid s heir 
0	their love was never drowned in care
0	of this or that thing nor grew cold
0	because their bodies had grown old 
0	being forbid to marry on earth
0	they blossomed to immortal mirth 
0	about the time when christ was born 
0	when the long wars for the white horn
0	and the brown bull had not yet come 
0	young baile honey mouth whom some
0	called rather baile little land 
0	rode out of emain with a band
0	of harpers and young men and they
0	imagined as they struck the way
0	to many pastured muirthemne 
0	that all things fell out happily
0	and there for all that fools had said 
0	baile and aillinn would be wed 
0	they found an old man running there 
0	he had ragged long grass yellow hair 
0	he had knees that stuck out of his hose 
0	he had puddle water in his shoes 
0	he had half a cloak to keep him dry 
0	although he had a squirrel s eye 
0	o wandering birds and rushy beds
0	you put such folly in our heads
0	with all this crying in the wind
0	no common love is to our mind 
0	and our poor kate or nan is less
0	than any whose unhappiness
0	awoke the harp strings long ago 
0	yet they that know all things but know
0	that all life had to give us is
0	a child s laughter a woman s kiss 
0	who was it put so great a scorn
0	in the grey reeds that night and morn
0	are trodden and broken by the herds 
0	and in the light bodies of birds
0	that north wind tumbles to and fro
0	and pinches among hail and snow 
0	that runner said i am from the south 
0	to tell him how the girl aillinn
0	rode from the country of her kin
0	and old and young men rode with her 
0	for all that country had been astir
0	if anybody half as fair
0	had chosen a husband anywhere
0	but where it could see her every day 
0	when they had ridden a little way
0	an old man caught the horse s head
0	with you must home again and wed
0	with somebody in your own land 
0	a young man cried and kissed her hand
0	 o lady wed with one of us 
0	and when no face grew piteous
0	for any gentle thing she spake
0	she fell and died of the heart break 
0	because a lover s heart s worn out
0	being tumbled and blown about
0	by its own blind imagining 
0	and will believe that anything
0	that is bad enough to be true is true 
0	baile s heart was broken in two 
0	and he being laid upon green boughs
0	was carried to the goodly house
0	where the hound of ulad sat before
0	the brazen pillars of his door 
0	his face bowed low to weep the end
0	of the harper s daughter and her friend 
0	for although years had passed away
0	he always wept them on that day 
0	for on that day they had been betrayed 
0	and now that honey mouth is laid
0	under a cairn of sleepy stone
0	before his eyes he has tears for none 
0	although he is carrying stone but two
0	for whom the cairn s but heaped anew 
0	we hold because our memory is
0	so full of that thing and of this
0	that out of sight is out of mind 
0	but the grey rush under the wind
0	and the grey bird with crooked bill
0	have such long memories that they still
0	remember deirdre and her man 
0	and when we walk with kate or nan
0	about the windy water side
0	our heart can hear the voices chide 
0	how could we be so soon content
0	who know the way that naoise went 
0	and they have news of deirdre s eyes
0	who being lovely was so wise 
0	ah wise my heart knows well how wise 
0	now had that old gaunt crafty one 
0	gathering his cloak about him run
0	where aillinn rode with waiting maids
0	who amid leafy lights and shades
0	dreamed of the hands that would unlace
0	their bodices in some dim place
0	when they had come to the marriage bed 
0	and harpers pondering with bowed head
0	a music that had thought enough
0	of the ebb of all things to make love
0	grow gentle without sorrowings 
0	and leather coated men with slings
0	who peered about on every side 
0	and amid leafy light he cried 
0	 he is well out of wind and wave 
0	they have heaped the stones above his grave
0	in muirthemne and over it
0	in changeless ogham letters writ
0	baile that was of rury s seed 
0	but the gods long ago decreed
0	no waiting maid should ever spread
0	baile and aillinn s marriage bed 
0	for they should clip and clip again
0	where wild bees hive on the great plain 
0	therefore it is but little news
0	that put this hurry in my shoes 
0	and hurrying to the south he came
0	to that high hill the herdsmen name
0	the hill seat of leighin because
0	some god or king had made the laws
0	that held the land together there 
0	in old times among the clouds of the air 
0	that old man climbed the day grew dim 
0	two swans came flying up to him
0	linked by a gold chain each to each
0	and with low murmuring laughing speech
0	alighted on the windy grass 
0	they knew him his changed body was
0	tall proud and ruddy and light wings
0	were hovering over the harp strings
0	that etain midhir s wife had wove
0	in the hid place being crazed by love 
0	what shall i call them fish that swim
0	scale rubbing scale where light is dim
0	by a broad water lily leaf 
0	or mice in the one wheaten sheaf
0	forgotten at the threshing place 
0	or birds lost in the one clear space
0	of morning light in a dim sky 
0	or it may be the eyelids of one eye
0	or the door pillars of one house 
0	or two sweet blossoming apple boughs
0	that have one shadow on the ground 
0	or the two strings that made one sound
0	where that wise harper s finger ran 
0	for this young girl and this young man
0	have happiness without an end
0	because they have made so good a friend 
0	they know all wonders for they pass
0	the towery gates of gorias
0	and long forgotten murias 
0	among the giant kings whose hoard
0	cauldron and spear and stone and sword
0	was robbed before earth gave the wheat 
0	wandering from broken street to street
0	they come where some huge watcher is
0	and tremble with their love and kiss 
0	they know undying things for they
0	wander where earth withers away 
0	though nothing troubles the great streams
0	but light from the pale stars and gleams
0	from the holy orchards where there is none
0	but fruit that is of precious stone 
0	or apples of the sun and moon 
0	what were our praise to them they eat
0	quiet s wild heart like daily meat 
0	who when night thickens are afloat
0	on dappled skins in a glass boat
0	far out under a windless sky 
0	while over them birds of aengus fly 
0	and over the tiller and the prow
0	 all rights reserved 
0	and waving white wings to and fro
0	awaken wanderings of light air
0	to stir their coverlet and their hair 
0	and poets found old writers say 
0	a yew tree where his body lay 
0	but a wild apple hid the grass
0	with its sweet blossom where hers was 
0	and being in good heart because
0	a better time had come again
0	after the deaths of many men 
0	and that long fighting at the ford 
0	they wrote on tablets of thin board 
0	set up electrotyped and published august 
0	made of the apple and the yew 
0	all the love stories that they knew 
0	let rush and bird cry out their fill
0	of the harper s daughter if they will 
0	beloved i am not afraid of her
0	she is not wiser nor lovelier 
0	and you are more high of heart than she
0	for all her wanderings over sea 
0	but i d have bird and rush forget
0	those other two for never yet
0	has lover lived but longed to wive
0	like them that are no more alive 
0	i thought of your beauty and this arrow
0	made out of a wild thought is in my marrow 
0	there s no man may look upon her no man 
0	as when newly grown to be a woman 
0	blossom pale she pulled down the pale blossom
0	at the moth hour and hid it in her bosom 
0	this beauty s kinder yet for a reason
0	i could weep that the old is out of season 
0	one that is ever kind said yesterday 
0	 your well beloved s hair has threads of grey
0	and little shadows come about her eyes 
0	time can but make it easier to be wise
0	though now it s hard till trouble is at an end 
0	and so be patient be wise and patient friend 
0	but heart there is no comfort not a grain 
0	time can but make her beauty over again
0	because of that great nobleness of hers 
0	the fire that stirs about her when she stirs
0	burns but more clearly o she had not these ways
0	when all the wild summer was in her gaze 
0	o heart o heart if she d but turn her head 
0	you d know the folly of being comforted 
0	i cried when the moon was murmuring to the birds 
0	 let peewit call and curlew cry where they will 
0	i long for your merry and tender and pitiful words 
0	for the roads are unending and there is no place to my mind 
0	the honey pale moon lay low on the sleepy hill
0	and i fell asleep upon lonely echtge of streams 
0	no boughs have withered because of the wintry wind 
0	the boughs have withered because i have told them my dreams 
0	i know of the leafy paths that the witches take 
0	who come with their crowns of pearl and their spindles of wool 
0	and their secret smile out of the depths of the lake 
0	and of apple islands where the danaan kind
0	wind and unwind their dances when the light grows cool
0	on the island lawns their feet where the pale foam gleams 
0	no boughs have withered because of the wintry wind 
0	the boughs have withered because i have told them my dreams 
0	i know of the sleepy country where swans fly round
0	coupled with golden chains and sing as they fly 
0	a king and a queen are wandering there and the sound
0	has made them so happy and hopeless so deaf and so blind
0	with wisdom they wander till all the years have gone by 
0	i know and the curlew and peewit on echtge of streams 
0	no boughs have withered because of the wintry wind 
0	the boughs have withered because i have told them my dreams 
0	we sat together at one summer s end
0	that beautiful mild woman your close friend
0	and you and i and talked of poetry 
0	i said a line will take us hours maybe 
0	yet if it does not seem a moment s thought
0	our stitching and unstitching has been naught 
0	better go down upon your marrow bones
0	and scrub a kitchen pavement or break stones
0	like an old pauper in all kinds of weather 
0	for to articulate sweet sounds together
0	is to work harder than all these and yet
0	be thought an idler by the noisy set
0	of bankers schoolmasters and clergymen
0	the martyrs call the world 
0	that woman then
0	murmured with her young voice for whose mild sake
0	there s many a one shall find out all heartache
0	in finding that it s young and mild and low 
0	 there is one thing that all we women know
0	although we never heard of it at school 
0	that we must labour to be beautiful 
0	i said it s certain there is no fine thing
0	since adam s fall but needs much labouring 
0	there have been lovers who thought love should be
0	so much compounded of high courtesy
0	that they would sigh and quote with learned looks
0	precedents out of beautiful old books 
0	yet now it seems an idle trade enough 
0	we sat grown quiet at the name of love 
0	we saw the last embers of daylight die
0	and in the trembling blue green of the sky
0	a moon worn as if it had been a shell
0	washed by time s waters as they rose and fell
0	about the stars and broke in days and years 
0	i had a thought for no one s but your ears 
0	that you were beautiful and that i strove
0	to love you in the old high way of love 
0	that it had all seemed happy and yet we d grown
0	as weary hearted as that hollow moon 
0	the old brown thorn trees break in two high over cummen strand
0	under a bitter black wind that blows from the left hand 
0	our courage breaks like an old tree in a black wind and dies 
0	but we have hidden in our hearts the flame out of the eyes
0	of cathleen the daughter of houlihan 
0	the wind has bundled up the clouds high over knocknarea
0	and thrown the thunder on the stones for all that maeve can say 
0	angers that are like noisy clouds have set our hearts abeat 
0	but we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet
0	of cathleen the daughter of houlihan 
0	the yellow pool has overflowed high up on clooth na bare 
0	for the wet winds are blowing out of the clinging air 
0	like heavy flooded waters our bodies and our blood 
0	but purer than a tall candle before the holy rood
0	is cathleen the daughter of houlihan 
0	i heard the old old men say
0	 everything alters 
0	and one by one we drop away 
0	they had hands like claws and their knees
0	were twisted like the old thorn trees
0	by the waters 
0	i heard the old old men say
0	 all that s beautiful drifts away
0	like the waters 
0	i have no happiness in dreaming of brycelinde 
0	nor avalon the grass green hollow nor joyous isle 
0	where one found lancelot crazed and hid him for a while 
0	nor ulad when naoise had thrown a sail upon the wind 
0	nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the heart 
0	land under wave where out of the moon s light and the sun s
0	seven old sisters wind the threads of the long lived ones 
0	land of the tower where aengus has thrown the gates apart 
0	and wood of wonders where one kills an ox at dawn
0	to find it when night falls laid on a golden bier 
0	therein are many queens like branwen and guinivere 
0	and whether i go in my dreams by woodland or dun or shore 
0	or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar 
0	i hear the harp string praise them or hear their mournful talk 
0	because of a story i heard under the thin horn
0	of the third moon that hung between the night and the day 
0	to dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay 
0	even in an old story is a burden not to be borne 
0	three voices together
0	hurry to bless the hands that play 
0	the mouths that speak the notes and strings 
0	o masters of the glittering town 
0	o lay the shrilly trumpet down 
0	though drunken with the flags that sway
0	over the ramparts and the towers 
0	and with the waving of your wings 
0	maybe they linger by the way 
0	one gathers up his purple gown 
0	one leans and mutters by the wall 
0	he dreads the weight of mortal hours 
0	o no o no they hurry down
0	like plovers that have heard the call 
0	o kinsmen of the three in one 
0	o kinsmen bless the hands that play 
0	the notes they waken shall live on
0	when all this heavy history s done 
0	our hands our hands must ebb away 
0	three voices together
0	the proud and careless notes live on
0	but bless our hands that ebb away 
0	from the play of the country of the young 
0	there s many a strong farmer
0	whose heart would break in two
0	if he could see the townland
0	that we are riding to 
0	boughs have their fruit and blossom 
0	at all times of the year 
0	rivers are running over
0	with red beer and brown beer 
0	an old man plays the bagpipes
0	in a golden and silver wood 
0	queens their eyes blue like the ice 
0	are dancing in a crowd 
0	the little fox he murmured 
0	 o what is the world s bane 
0	the sun was laughing sweetly 
0	the moon plucked at my rein 
0	but the little red fox murmured 
0	 o do not pluck at his rein 
0	he is riding to the townland
0	that is the world s bane 
0	when their hearts are so high 
0	that they would come to blows 
0	they unhook their heavy swords
0	from golden and silver boughs 
0	but all that are killed in battle
0	awaken to life again 
0	it is lucky that their story
0	is not known among men 
0	for o the strong farmers
0	for their hearts would be like a cup
0	that somebody had drunk dry 
0	the little fox he murmured 
0	 o what is the world s bane 
0	the sun was laughing sweetly 
0	the moon plucked at my rein 
0	but the little red fox murmured 
0	 o do not pluck at his rein 
0	he is riding to the townland
0	that is the world s bane 
0	michael will unhook his trumpet
0	from a bough overhead 
0	and blow a little noise
0	when the supper has been spread 
0	gabriel will come from the water
0	with a fish tail and talk
0	of wonders that have happened
0	on wet roads where men walk 
0	and lift up an old horn
0	of hammered silver and drink
0	till he has fallen asleep
0	upon the starry brink 
0	the little fox he murmured 
0	 o what is the world s bane 
0	the sun was laughing sweetly 
0	the moon plucked at my rein 
0	but the little red fox murmured 
0	 o do not pluck at his rein 
0	he is riding to the townland 
0	that is the world s bane 
0	i made some of these poems walking about
0	among the seven woods before the big wind of
0	nineteen hundred and three blew down so many
0	trees troubled the wild creatures changed the
0	look of things and i thought out there a good
0	part of the play which follows the first shape of
0	it came to me in a dream but it changed much in
0	the making foreshadowing it may be a change
0	that may bring a less dream burdened will into my
0	verses i never re wrote anything so many times 
0	for at first i could not make these wills that stream
0	into mere life poetical but now i hope to do
0	easily much more of the kind and that our new
0	irish players will find the buskin and the sock 
0	cuchullain the king of muirthemne 
0	concobar the high king of ullad 
0	daire a king 
0	fintain a blind man 
0	barach a fool 
0	fintain a fat blind man who is somewhat older 
0	what is his name fool 
0	they are chairs 
0	and this 
0	why that s a bench 
0	and this 
0	a big chair 
0	and there is another big chair on the other side of the hall 
0	they have 
0	about the young man and the fighting 
0	and after that we can go and eat the fowl for i am hungry 
0	time enough time enough you re in as great a hurry as when you
0	it matters nothing to us but he has come at last 
0	who has come 
0	you saw him 
0	i used to be in aoife s country when i had my eyesight 
0	nobody could do that who was his father 
0	nobody but aoife knew that not even he himself 
0	not even he himself was aoife a goddess lecherous 
0	thought him one of the riders of the sidhe because the child was
0	you have thought something 
0	how can he have cuchullain s eyes 
0	he is cuchullain s son 
0	and his mother has sent him hither to fight his father 
0	i have remembered that i am hungry 
0	i won t listen to your story 
0	no there is plenty for us both 
0	come with me where it is 
0	it is a fine fowl it was the biggest in the yard 
0	no no he begins pulling fintain towards the door 
0	no no i am hungry what a head you have blind man who but you
0	you have hurled that stone beyond our utmost mark
0	time after time but yet you are not weary 
0	he has slept on the bare ground of fuad s hill
0	this week past waiting for the bulls and the deer 
0	well why should i be weary 
0	it is certain
0	his father was the god who wheels the sun 
0	and not king sualtam 
0	 to a young king who is beside him he came in the dawn 
0	and folded dectara in a sudden fire 
0	and yet the mother s half might well grow weary 
0	and it new come from labours over sea 
0	he has been on islands walled about with silver 
0	and fought with giants 
0	 they gather about the ale vat and begin to drink 
0	who was it that went out 
0	as we came in 
0	barach and blind fintain 
0	they always flock together the blind man
0	has need of the fool s eyesight and strong body 
0	while the poor fool has need of the other s wit 
0	and night and day is up to his ears in mischief
0	that the blind man imagines there s no hen yard
0	but clucks and cackles when he passes by
0	as if he d been a fox if i d that ball
0	that s in your hair and the big stone again 
0	i d keep them tossing though the one is heavy
0	and the other light in the hand a trick i learnt
0	when i was learning arms in aoife s country 
0	what kind of woman was that aoife 
0	but i have heard that she was never married 
0	and yet that s natural for i have never known
0	a fighting woman but made her favours cheap 
0	or mocked at love till she grew sandy dry 
0	what manner of woman do you like the best 
0	a gentle or a fierce 
0	a gentle surely 
0	i think that a fierce woman s better a woman
0	that breaks away when you have thought her won 
0	for i d be fed and hungry at one time 
0	i think that all deep passion is but a kiss
0	in the mid battle and a difficult peace
0	 twixt oil and water candles and dark night 
0	hill side and hollow the hot footed sun 
0	and the cold sliding slippery footed moon 
0	a brief forgiveness between opposites
0	that have been hatreds for three times the age
0	of his long stablished ground here s concobar 
0	so i ll be done but keep beside me still 
0	for while he talks of hammered bronze and asks
0	what wood is best for building we can talk
0	of a fierce woman 
0	 to one of those about him has the ship gone
0	yet we have need of more bronze workers
0	and that ship i sent to africa for gold is late 
0	i knew their talk 
0	 seeing cuchullain you are before us king 
0	so much the better for i welcome you
0	but who are these 
0	the odour from their garments when they stir
0	is like a wind out of an apple garden 
0	my swordsmen and harp players and fine dancers 
0	my bosom friends 
0	i should have thought cuchullain 
0	my graver company would better match
0	your greatness and your years but i waste breath
0	in harping on that tale 
0	you do great king 
0	because their youth is the kind wandering wave
0	that carries me about the world and if it sank 
0	my sword would lose its lightness 
0	emain should be the foremost town of the world 
0	it is the foremost town 
0	no no it s not 
0	nothing but men can make towns great and he 
0	the one over topping man that s in the world 
0	keeps far away 
0	he will not hear you king 
0	and we old men had best keep company
0	with one another i ll fill the horn for you 
0	i will not drink old fool you have drunk a horn
0	at every door we came to 
0	you d better drink 
0	for old men light upon their youth again
0	in the brown ale when i have drunk enough 
0	i am like cuchullain as one pea another 
0	and live like a bird s flight from tree to tree 
0	we ll to our chairs for we have much to talk of 
0	and we have ullad and muirthemne and here
0	is conall muirthemne in the nick of time 
0	will you not drink 
0	not till the council s over 
0	but i ll drink daire 
0	fill me a horn too daire 
0	if i d drunk half that you have drunk to day 
0	i d be upon all fours 
0	that would be natural
0	when mother earth had given you this good milk
0	from her great breasts 
0	 to one of the young kings beside him 
0	one is content awhile
0	with a soft warm woman who folds up our lives
0	in silky network then one knows not why 
0	but one s away after a flinty heart 
0	how long can the net keep us 
0	all our lives
0	if there are children and a dozen moons
0	if there are none because a growing child
0	has so much need of watching it can make
0	a passion that s as changeable as the sea
0	change till it holds the wide earth to its heart 
0	at least i have heard a father say it but i
0	being childless do not know it come nearer yet 
0	though he is ringing that old silver rod
0	we ll have our own talk out they cannot hear us 
0	i have called you hither kings of ullad and kings
0	and tributary kings for now there is peace 
0	it s time to build up emain that was burned
0	at the outsetting of these wars for we 
0	being the foremost men should have high chairs
0	and be much stared at and wondered at and speak
0	out of more laughing overflowing hearts
0	than common men it is the art of kings
0	to make what s noble nobler in men s eyes
0	by wide uplifted roofs where beaten gold 
0	that s ruddy with desire marries pale silver
0	among the shadowing beams and many a time
0	i would have called you hither to this work 
0	but always when i d all but summoned you 
0	some war or some rebellion would break out 
0	where s maine morgor and old usnach s children 
0	and that high headed even walking queen 
0	and many near as great that got their death
0	because you hated peace i can remember
0	the people crying out when deirdre passed
0	and maine morgor had a cold grey eye 
0	well well i ll throw this heel tap on the ground 
0	for it may be they are thirsty 
0	be silent fool 
0	be silent daire 
0	let him speak his mind 
0	i have no need to be afraid of ghosts 
0	for i have made but necessary wars 
0	i warred to strengthen emain or because
0	when wars are out they marry and beget
0	and have their generations like mankind
0	and there s no help for it but i m well content
0	that they have ended and left the town so great 
0	that its mere name shall be in times to come
0	like a great ale vat where the men of the world
0	shall drink no common ale but the hard will 
0	the unquenchable hope the friendliness of the sword 
0	give me the building plans and have you written
0	that we cuchullain is looking in his shield 
0	it may be the pale riders of the wind
0	throw pictures on it or that mananan 
0	his father s friend and sometime fosterer 
0	foreknower of all things has cast a vision 
0	out of the cold dark of the rich sea 
0	foretelling emain s greatness 
0	no great king 
0	i looked on this out of mere idleness 
0	imagining a woman that i loved 
0	 the sound of a trumpet without 
0	open the door for that is a herald s trumpet 
0	centre of the hall the trumpeting ceases 
0	what is your message 
0	i am of aoife s army 
0	queen aoife and her army have fallen upon us 
0	out swords out swords 
0	they are about the house 
0	rush out rush out before they have fired the thatch 
0	aoife is far away i am alone 
0	i have come alone in the midst of you
0	to weigh this sword against cuchullain s sword 
0	 there is a murmur amongst the kings 
0	and are you noble for if of common seed
0	you cannot weigh your sword against his sword
0	but in mixed battle 
0	i am under bonds
0	to tell my name to no man but it s noble 
0	but i would know your name and not your bonds 
0	you cannot speak in the assembly house
0	if you are not noble 
0	 drawing his sword 
0	i will give no other proof than the hawk gives
0	that it s no sparrow 
0	 he is silent a moment then speaks to all 
0	yet look upon me kings 
0	i too am of that ancient seed and carry
0	the signs about this body and in these bones 
0	to have shown the hawk s grey feather is enough
0	and you speak highly too 
0	give me that helmet 
0	i d thought they had grown weary sending champions 
0	that coat will do i d half forgotten boy 
0	how all those great kings came into the mouse trap
0	that had been baited with maeve s pretty daughter 
0	how findabair that blue eyed findabair 
0	but the tale is worthy of a winter s night 
0	that buckle should be tighter give me your shield 
0	there is good level ground at baile s yew tree
0	some dozen yards from here and it s but truth
0	that i am sad to day and this fight welcome 
0	hither into the light 
0	 turning to one of the young kings 
0	that s the very tint
0	of her that i was speaking of but now 
0	not a pin s difference 
0	you are from the north
0	where there are many that have that tint of hair
0	red brown the light red brown come nearer boy 
0	for i would have another look at you 
0	there s more likeness a pale a stone pale cheek 
0	what brought you boy have you no fear of death 
0	whether i live or die is in the gods hands 
0	that is all words all words a young man s talk 
0	i am their plough their harrow their very strength 
0	for he that s in the sun begot this body
0	upon a mortal woman and i have heard tell
0	it seemed as if he had outrun the moon 
0	that he must always follow through waste heaven 
0	he loved so happily he ll be but slow
0	to break a tree that was so sweetly planted 
0	let s see that arm i ll see it if i like 
0	that arm had a good father and a good mother
0	but it is not like this 
0	you are mocking me 
0	you think i am not worthy to be fought 
0	but i ll not wrangle but with this talkative knife 
0	put up your sword i am not mocking you 
0	i d have you for my friend but if it s not
0	because you have a hot heart and a cold eye
0	i cannot tell the reason you ve got her fierceness 
0	and nobody is as fierce as those pale women 
0	 to the young kings 
0	we ll keep him here in muirthemne awhile 
0	you are the leader of our pack and therefore
0	may cry what you will 
0	you ll stop with us
0	and we will hunt the deer and the wild bulls
0	and when we have grown weary light our fires
0	in sandy places where the wool white foam
0	is murmuring and breaking and it may be
0	that long haired women will come out of the dunes
0	to dance in the yellow fire light you hang your head 
0	young man as if it was not a good life 
0	and yet what s better than to hurl the spear 
0	and hear the long remembering harp and dance 
0	friendship grows quicker in the murmuring dark 
0	but i can see there s no more need for words
0	and that you ll be my friend now 
0	forbid their friendship for it will get twisted
0	to a reproach against us 
0	i d never need to cry cuchullain on
0	and would not now 
0	they ll say his manhood s quenched 
0	i ll give you gifts but i ll have something too 
0	an arm ring or the like and if you will
0	we ll fight it out when you are older boy 
0	aoife will make some story out of this 
0	well well what matter i ll have that arm ring boy 
0	there is no man i d sooner have my friend
0	than you whose name has gone about the world
0	as if it had been the wind but aoife d say
0	i had turned coward 
0	i ll give you gifts
0	that aoife ll know and all her people know
0	to have been my gifts mananan son of the sea
0	gave me this heavy purple cloak nine queens
0	of the land under wave had woven it
0	out of the fleeces of the sea o tell her
0	i was afraid or tell her what you will 
0	no tell her that i heard a raven croak
0	on the north side of the house and was afraid 
0	some witch of the air has troubled cuchullain s mind 
0	no witchcraft his head is like a woman s head
0	i had a fancy for 
0	a witch of the air
0	can make a leaf confound us with memories 
0	they have gone to school to learn the trick of it 
0	but there s no trick in this that arm ring boy 
0	he shall not go unfought i ll fight with him 
0	no i will fight with him 
0	i claim the fight 
0	for when we sent an army to her land 
0	i claim the fight for one of aoife s galleys
0	stole my great cauldron and a herd of pigs 
0	no no i claim it for at lammas time 
0	back back put up your swords put up your swords 
0	there s none alive that shall accept a challenge
0	i have refused laegaire put up your sword 
0	no let them come let any three together 
0	if they ve a mind to i ll try it out with four 
0	that s spoken as i d spoken it at your age 
0	but you are in my house whatever man
0	would fight with you shall fight it out with me 
0	 drawing his sword 
0	this mutterer this old whistler this sand piper 
0	this edge that s greyer than the tide this mouse
0	that s gnawing at the timbers of the world 
0	this this boy i would meet them all in arms
0	if i d a son like you he would avenge me
0	when i have withstood for the last time the men
0	whose fathers brothers sons and friends i have killed
0	upholding ullad when the four provinces
0	have gathered with the ravens over them 
0	but i d need no avenger you and i
0	would scatter them like water from a dish 
0	we ll stand by one another from this out 
0	here is the ring 
0	no turn and turn about
0	but my turn is first because i am the older 
0	cliodna embroidered these bird wings but fand
0	made all these little golden eyes with the hairs
0	that she had stolen out of aengus beard 
0	and therefore none that has this cloak about him
0	is crossed in love the heavy inlaid brooch
0	that buan hammered has a merit too 
0	 in a loud voice 
0	no more of that i will not have this friendship 
0	cuchullain is my man and i forbid it 
0	he shall not go unfought for i myself 
0	witchcraft has maddened you 
0	 shouting yes witchcraft witchcraft 
0	you saw another s head upon his shoulders

0	then raised your hand against the king of ullad 
0	 letting concobar go and looking wildly about him 
0	yes yes all of a sudden all of a sudden 
0	why there s no witchcraft in it i myself
0	have made a hundred of these sudden friendships
0	and fought it out next day but that was folly 
0	for now that i am old i know it is best
0	to live in comfort

0	with portrait and some new chapters net 
0	literature the new york herald 
0	 the best book of its kind that has appeared since maeterlinck s
0	i have heard the pigeons of the seven woods
0	make their faint thunder and the garden bees
0	not a poor fool understands 
0	 all rights reserved 
0	set up and electrotyped published march 
0	the trees are in their autumn beauty 
0	the woodland paths are dry 
0	under the october twilight the water
0	mirrors a still sky 
0	upon the brimming water among the stones
0	are nine and fifty swans 
0	the nineteenth autumn has come upon me
0	since i first made my count 
0	i saw before i had well finished 
0	all suddenly mount
0	and scatter wheeling in great broken rings
0	upon their clamorous wings 
0	i have looked upon those brilliant creatures 
0	and now my heart is sore 
0	all s changed since i hearing at twilight 
0	the first time on this shore 
0	the bell beat of their wings above my head 
0	trod with a lighter tread 
0	unwearied still lover by lover 
0	they paddle in the cold 
0	companionable streams or climb the air 
0	their hearts have not grown old 
0	passion or conquest wander where they will 
0	attend upon them still 
0	but now they drift on the still water
0	mysterious beautiful 
0	among what rushes will they build 
0	by what lake s edge or pool
0	delight men s eyes when i awake some day
0	to find they have flown away 
0	now that we re almost settled in our house
0	i ll name the friends that cannot sup with us
0	beside a fire of turf in the ancient tower 
0	and having talked to some late hour
0	climb up the narrow winding stair to bed 
0	discoverers of forgotten truth
0	or mere companions of my youth 
0	all all are in my thoughts to night being dead 
0	always we d have the new friend meet the old 
0	and we are hurt if either friend seem cold 
0	and there is salt to lengthen out the smart
0	in the affections of our heart 
0	and quarrels are blown up upon that head 
0	but not a friend that i would bring
0	this night can set us quarrelling 
0	for all that come into my mind are dead 
0	lionel johnson comes the first to mind 
0	that loved his learning better than mankind 
0	though courteous to the worst much falling he
0	brooded upon sanctity
0	till all his greek and latin learning seemed
0	a long blast upon the horn that brought
0	a little nearer to his thought
0	a measureless consummation that he dreamed 
0	and that enquiring man john synge comes next 
0	that dying chose the living world for text
0	and never could have rested in the tomb
0	but that long travelling he had come
0	towards nightfall upon certain set apart
0	in a most desolate stony place 
0	towards nightfall upon a race
0	passionate and simple like his heart 
0	and then i think of old george pollexfen 
0	in muscular youth well known to mayo men
0	for horsemanship at meets or at race courses 
0	that could have shown how purebred horses
0	and solid men for all their passion live
0	but as the outrageous stars incline
0	by opposition square and trine 
0	having grown sluggish and contemplative 
0	they were my close companions many a year 
0	a portion of my mind and life as it were 
0	and now their breathless faces seem to look
0	out of some old picture book 
0	i am accustomed to their lack of breath 
0	but not that my dear friend s dear son 
0	our sidney and our perfect man 
0	could share in that discourtesy of death 
0	for all things the delighted eye now sees
0	were loved by him the old storm broken trees
0	that cast their shadows upon road and bridge 
0	the tower set on the stream s edge 
0	the ford where drinking cattle make a stir
0	nightly and startled by that sound
0	the water hen must change her ground 
0	he might have been your heartiest welcomer 
0	when with the galway foxhounds he would ride
0	from castle taylor to the roxborough side
0	or esserkelly plain few kept his pace 
0	at mooneen he had leaped a place
0	so perilous that half the astonished meet
0	had shut their eyes and where was it
0	he rode a race without a bit 
0	and yet his mind outran the horses feet 
0	we dreamed that a great painter had been born
0	to cold clare rock and galway rock and thorn 
0	to that stern colour and that delicate line
0	that are our secret discipline
0	wherein the gazing heart doubles her might 
0	soldier scholar horseman he 
0	and yet he had the intensity
0	to have published all to be a world s delight 
0	what other could so well have counselled us
0	in all lovely intricacies of a house
0	as he that practised or that understood
0	all work in metal or in wood 
0	in moulded plaster or in carven stone 
0	soldier scholar horseman he 
0	and all he did done perfectly
0	as though he had but that one trade alone 
0	the entire combustible world in one small room
0	as though dried straw and if we turn about
0	the bare chimney is gone black out
0	because the work had finished in that flare 
0	soldier scholar horseman he 
0	as twere all life s epitome 
0	what made us dream that he could comb grey hair 
0	i had thought seeing how bitter is that wind
0	that shakes the shutter to have brought to mind
0	all those that manhood tried or childhood loved 
0	or boyish intellect approved 
0	with some appropriate commentary on each 
0	until imagination brought
0	a fitter welcome but a thought
0	of that late death took all my heart for speech 
0	i know that i shall meet my fate
0	somewhere among the clouds above 
0	those that i fight i do not hate
0	those that i guard i do not love 
0	my country is kiltartan cross 
0	my countrymen kiltartan s poor 
0	no likely end could bring them loss
0	or leave them happier than before 
0	nor law nor duty bade me fight 
0	nor public man nor angry crowds 
0	a lonely impulse of delight
0	drove to this tumult in the clouds 
0	i balanced all brought all to mind 
0	the years to come seemed waste of breath 
0	a waste of breath the years behind
0	in balance with this life this death 
0	i am worn out with dreams 
0	a weather worn marble triton
0	among the streams 
0	and all day long i look
0	upon this lady s beauty
0	as though i had found in book
0	a pictured beauty 
0	pleased to have filled the eyes
0	or the discerning ears 
0	delighted to be but wise 
0	for men improve with the years 
0	and yet and yet
0	is this my dream or the truth 
0	o would that we had met
0	when i had my burning youth 
0	but i grow old among dreams 
0	a weather worn marble triton
0	among the streams 
0	would i could cast a sail on the water
0	where many a king has gone
0	and many a king s daughter 
0	and alight at the comely trees and the lawn 
0	the playing upon pipes and the dancing 
0	and learn that the best thing is
0	to change my loves while dancing
0	and pay but a kiss for a kiss 
0	i would find by the edge of that water
0	the collar bone of a hare
0	worn thin by the lapping of water 
0	and pierce it through with a gimlet and stare
0	at the old bitter world where they marry in churches 
0	and laugh over the untroubled water
0	at all who marry in churches 
0	through the white thin bone of a hare 
0	 although i d lie lapped up in linen
0	a deal i d sweat and little earn
0	if i should live as live the neighbours 
0	cried the beggar billy byrne 
0	 stretch bones till the daylight come
0	on great grandfather s battered tomb 
0	upon a grey old battered tombstone
0	in glendalough beside the stream 
0	where the o byrnes and byrnes are buried 
0	he stretched his bones and fell in a dream
0	of sun and moon that a good hour
0	bellowed and pranced in the round tower 
0	of golden king and silver lady 
0	bellowing up and bellowing round 
0	till toes mastered a sweet measure 
0	mouth mastered a sweet sound 
0	prancing round and prancing up
0	until they pranced upon the top 
0	that golden king and that wild lady
0	sang till stars began to fade 
0	hands gripped in hands toes close together 
0	hair spread on the wind they made 
0	that lady and that golden king
0	could like a brace of blackbirds sing 
0	 it s certain that my luck is broken 
0	that rambling jailbird billy said 
0	 before nightfall i ll pick a pocket
0	and snug it in a feather bed 
0	i cannot find the peace of home
0	on great grandfather s battered tomb 
0	and kissed her dusky face 
0	 all day long from mid day
0	we have talked in the one place 
0	all day long from shadowless noon
0	we have gone round and round
0	in the narrow theme of love
0	like an old horse in a pound 
0	to solomon sang sheba 
0	planted on his knees 
0	 if you had broached a matter
0	that might the learned please 
0	you had before the sun had thrown
0	our shadows on the ground
0	discovered that my thoughts not it 
0	are but a narrow pound 
0	and kissed her arab eyes 
0	 there s not a man or woman
0	born under the skies
0	dare match in learning with us two 
0	and all day long we have found
0	there s not a thing but love can make
0	the world a narrow pound 
0	i ll say and maybe dream i have drawn content 
0	seeing that time has frozen up the blood 
0	the wick of youth being burned and the oil spent 
0	from beauty that is cast out of a mould
0	in bronze or that in dazzling marble appears 
0	appears and when we have gone is gone again 
0	being more indifferent to our solitude
0	than twere an apparition o heart we are old 
0	the living beauty is for younger men 
0	we cannot pay its tribute of wild tears 
0	i thought no more was needed
0	youth to prolong
0	to keep the body young 
0	oh who could have foretold
0	that the heart grows old 
0	though i have many words 
0	what woman s satisfied 
0	i am no longer faint
0	because at her side 
0	oh who could have foretold
0	that the heart grows old 
0	i have not lost desire
0	but the heart that i had 
0	i thought twould burn my body
0	laid on the death bed 
0	but who could have foretold
0	that the heart grows old 
0	dear fellow artist why so free
0	with every sort of company 
0	with every jack and jill 
0	choose your companions from the best 
0	who draws a bucket with the rest
0	soon topples down the hill 
0	you may that mirror for a school 
0	be passionate not bountiful
0	as common beauties may 
0	who were not born to keep in trim
0	with old ezekiel s cherubim
0	but those of beaujolet 
0	i know what wages beauty gives 
0	how hard a life her servant lives 
0	yet praise the winters gone 
0	there is not a fool can call me friend 
0	and i may dine at journey s end
0	with landor and with donne 
0	my dear my dear i know
0	more than another
0	what makes your heart beat so 
0	not even your own mother
0	can know it as i know 
0	who broke my heart for her
0	when the wild thought 
0	that she denies
0	and has forgot 
0	set all her blood astir
0	and glittered in her eyes 
0	bald heads forgetful of their sins 
0	old learned respectable bald heads
0	edit and annotate the lines
0	that young men tossing on their beds 
0	rhymed out in love s despair
0	to flatter beauty s ignorant ear 
0	they ll cough in the ink to the world s end 
0	wear out the carpet with their shoes
0	earning respect have no strange friend 
0	if they have sinned nobody knows 
0	lord what would they say
0	should their catullus walk that way 
0	 though logic choppers rule the town 
0	and every man and maid and boy
0	has marked a distant object down 
0	an aimless joy is a pure joy 
0	that saw the surges running by 
0	 and wisdom is a butterfly
0	and not a gloomy bird of prey 
0	 if little planned is little sinned
0	but little need the grave distress 
0	what s dying but a second wind 
0	how but in zigzag wantonness
0	could trumpeter michael be so brave 
0	or something of that sort he said 
0	 and if my dearest friend were dead
0	i d dance a measure on his grave 
0	that cry s from the first cuckoo of the year
0	i wished before it ceased 
0	nor bird nor beast
0	could make me wish for anything this day 
0	being old but that the old alone might die 
0	and that would be against god s providence 
0	let the young wish but what has brought you here 
0	never until this moment have we met
0	where my goats browse on the scarce grass or leap
0	from stone to stone 
0	i am looking for strayed sheep 
0	something has troubled me and in my trouble
0	i let them stray i thought of rhyme alone 
0	for rhyme can beat a measure out of trouble
0	and make the daylight sweet once more but when
0	i had driven every rhyme into its place
0	the sheep had gone from theirs 
0	i know right well
0	what turned so good a shepherd from his charge 
0	he that was best in every country sport
0	and every country craft and of us all
0	most courteous to slow age and hasty youth
0	is dead 
0	the boy that brings my griddle cake
0	brought the bare news 
0	he had thrown the crook away
0	and died in the great war beyond the sea 
0	he had often played his pipes among my hills
0	and when he played it was their loneliness 
0	the exultation of their stone that cried
0	under his fingers 
0	i had it from his mother 
0	and his own flock was browsing at the door 
0	how does she bear her grief there is not a shepherd
0	but grows more gentle when he speaks her name 
0	remembering kindness done and how can i 
0	that found when i had neither goat nor grazing
0	new welcome and old wisdom at her fire
0	till winter blasts were gone but speak of her
0	even before his children and his wife 
0	she goes about her house erect and calm
0	between the pantry and the linen chest 
0	or else at meadow or at grazing overlooks
0	her labouring men as though her darling lived
0	but for her grandson now there is no change
0	but such as i have seen upon her face
0	watching our shepherd sports at harvest time
0	when her son s turn was over 
0	sing your song 
0	i too have rhymed my reveries but youth
0	is hot to show whatever it has found
0	and till that s done can neither work nor wait 
0	old goatherds and old goats if in all else
0	youth can excel them in accomplishment 
0	are learned in waiting 
0	you cannot but have seen
0	that he alone had gathered up no gear 
0	set carpenters to work on no wide table 
0	on no long bench nor lofty milking shed
0	as others will when first they take possession 
0	but left the house as in his father s time
0	as though he knew himself as it were a cuckoo 
0	no settled man and now that he is gone
0	there s nothing of him left but half a score
0	of sorrowful austere sweet lofty pipe tunes 
0	you have put the thought in rhyme 
0	i worked all day
0	and when twas done so little had i done
0	that maybe i am sorry in plain prose
0	had sounded better to your mountain fancy 
0	 like the speckled bird that steers
0	thousands of leagues oversea 
0	and runs for a while or a while half flies
0	upon his yellow legs through our meadows 
0	he stayed for a while and we
0	had scarcely accustomed our ears
0	to his speech at the break of day 
0	had scarcely accustomed our eyes
0	to his shape in the lengthening shadows 
0	where the sheep are thrown in the pool 
0	when he vanished from ears and eyes 
0	i had wished a dear thing on that day
0	i heard him first but man is a fool 
0	you sing as always of the natural life 
0	and i that made like music in my youth
0	hearing it now have sighed for that young man
0	and certain lost companions of my own 
0	they say that on your barren mountain ridge
0	you have measured out the road that the soul treads
0	when it has vanished from our natural eyes 
0	that you have talked with apparitions 
0	my daily thoughts since the first stupor of youth
0	have found the path my goats feet cannot find 
0	sing for it may be that your thoughts have plucked
0	some medicable herb to make our grief
0	less bitter 
0	they have brought me from that ridge
0	seed pods and flowers that are not all wild poppy 
0	 he grows younger every second
0	that were all his birthdays reckoned
0	much too solemn seemed 
0	because of what he had dreamed 
0	or the ambitions that he served 
0	much too solemn and reserved 
0	jaunting journeying
0	to his own dayspring 
0	he unpacks the loaded pern
0	of all twas pain or joy to learn 
0	of all that he had made 
0	the outrageous war shall fade 
0	at some old winding whitethorn root
0	he ll practice on the shepherd s flute 
0	or on the close cropped grass
0	court his shepherd lass 
0	or run where lads reform our day time
0	till that is their long shouting play time 
0	knowledge he shall unwind
0	through victories of the mind 
0	till clambering at the cradle side 
0	he dreams himself his mother s pride 
0	all knowledge lost in trance
0	of sweeter ignorance 
0	when i have shut these ewes and this old ram
0	into the fold we ll to the woods and there
0	cut out our rhymes on strips of new torn bark
0	but put no name and leave them at her door 
0	to know the mountain and the valley grieve
0	may be a quiet thought to wife and mother 
0	and children when they spring up shoulder high 
0	when have i last looked on
0	the round green eyes and the long wavering bodies
0	of the dark leopards of the moon 
0	all the wild witches those most noble ladies 
0	for all their broom sticks and their tears 
0	their angry tears are gone 
0	the holy centaurs of the hills are banished 
0	and i have nothing but harsh sun 
0	heroic mother moon has vanished 
0	and now that i have come to fifty years
0	i must endure the timid sun 
0	i would be ignorant as the dawn
0	that has looked down
0	on that old queen measuring a town
0	with the pin of a brooch 
0	or on the withered men that saw
0	from their pedantic babylon
0	the careless planets in their courses 
0	the stars fade out where the moon comes 
0	and took their tablets and did sums 
0	i would be ignorant as the dawn
0	that merely stood rocking the glittering coach
0	above the cloudy shoulders of the horses 
0	i would be for no knowledge is worth a straw 
0	ignorant and wanton as the dawn 
0	may god be praised for woman
0	that gives up all her mind 
0	a man may find in no man
0	a friendship of her kind
0	that covers all he has brought
0	as with her flesh and bone 
0	nor quarrels with a thought
0	because it is not her own 
0	though pedantry denies
0	it s plain the bible means
0	that solomon grew wise
0	while talking with his queens 
0	yet never could although
0	they say he counted grass 
0	count all the praises due
0	when sheba was his lass 
0	when she the iron wrought or
0	when from the smithy fire
0	it shuddered in the water 
0	harshness of their desire
0	that made them stretch and yawn 
0	pleasure that comes with sleep 
0	shudder that made them one 
0	what else he give or keep
0	god grant me no not here 
0	for i am not so bold
0	to hope a thing so dear
0	now i am growing old 
0	but when if the tale s true
0	the pestle of the moon
0	that pounds up all anew
0	brings me to birth again 
0	to find what once i had
0	and know what once i have known 
0	until i am driven mad 
0	sleep driven from my bed 
0	by tenderness and care 
0	pity an aching head 
0	gnashing of teeth despair 
0	and all because of some one
0	perverse creature of chance 
0	and live like solomon
0	that sheba led a dance 
0	although i can see him still 
0	the freckled man who goes
0	to a grey place on a hill
0	in grey connemara clothes
0	at dawn to cast his flies 
0	it s long since i began
0	to call up to the eyes
0	this wise and simple man 
0	all day i d looked in the face
0	what i had hoped twould be
0	to write for my own race
0	and the reality 
0	the living men that i hate 
0	the dead man that i loved 
0	the craven man in his seat 
0	the insolent unreproved 
0	and no knave brought to book
0	who has won a drunken cheer 
0	the witty man and his joke
0	aimed at the commonest ear 
0	the clever man who cries
0	the catch cries of the clown 
0	the beating down of the wise
0	and great art beaten down 
0	maybe a twelvemonth since
0	suddenly i began 
0	in scorn of this audience 
0	and his sun freckled face 
0	and grey connemara cloth 
0	climbing up to a place
0	where stone is dark under froth 
0	and the down turn of his wrist
0	when the flies drop in the stream 
0	a man who does not exist 
0	a man who is but a dream 
0	and cried before i am old
0	i shall have written him one
0	poem maybe as cold
0	and passionate as the dawn 
0	 call down the hawk from the air 
0	let him be hooded or caged
0	till the yellow eye has grown mild 
0	for larder and spit are bare 
0	the old cook enraged 
0	the scullion gone wild 
0	 i will not be clapped in a hood 
0	nor a cage nor alight upon wrist 
0	now i have learnt to be proud
0	hovering over the wood
0	in the broken mist
0	or tumbling cloud 
0	 what tumbling cloud did you cleave 
0	yellow eyed hawk of the mind 
0	last evening that i who had sat
0	should give to my friend
0	a pretence of wit 
0	one had a lovely face 
0	and two or three had charm 
0	but charm and face were in vain
0	because the mountain grass
0	cannot but keep the form
0	where the mountain hare has lain 
0	she is foremost of those that i would hear praised 
0	i have gone about the house gone up and down
0	as a man does who has published a new book
0	or a young girl dressed out in her new gown 
0	and though i have turned the talk by hook or crook
0	until her praise should be the uppermost theme 
0	a woman spoke of some new tale she had read 
0	a man confusedly in a half dream
0	as though some other name ran in his head 
0	she is foremost of those that i would hear praised 
0	i will talk no more of books or the long war
0	but walk by the dry thorn until i have found
0	some beggar sheltering from the wind and there
0	manage the talk until her name come round 
0	if there be rags enough he will know her name
0	and be well pleased remembering it for in the old days 
0	though she had young men s praise and old men s blame 
0	among the poor both old and young gave her praise 
0	 what have i earned for all that work i said 
0	 for all that i have done at my own charge 
0	the daily spite of this unmannerly town 
0	where who has served the most is most defamed 
0	the reputation of his lifetime lost
0	between the night and morning i might have lived 
0	and you know well how great the longing has been 
0	where every day my footfall should have lit
0	in the green shadow of ferrara wall 
0	or climbed among the images of the past 
0	the unperturbed and courtly images 
0	evening and morning the steep street of urbino
0	to where the duchess and her people talked
0	the stately midnight through until they stood
0	in their great window looking at the dawn 
0	i might have had no friend that could not mix
0	courtesy and passion into one like those
0	that saw the wicks grow yellow in the dawn 
0	i might have used the one substantial right
0	my trade allows chosen my company 
0	and chosen what scenery had pleased me best 
0	thereon my phoenix answered in reproof 
0	 the drunkards pilferers of public funds 
0	all the dishonest crowd i had driven away 
0	when my luck changed and they dared meet my face 
0	crawled from obscurity and set upon me
0	those i had served and some that i had fed 
0	yet never have i now nor any time 
0	complained of the people 
0	all i could reply
0	was you that have not lived in thought but deed 
0	can have the purity of a natural force 
0	but i whose virtues are the definitions
0	of the analytic mind can neither close
0	the eye of the mind nor keep my tongue from speech 
0	and yet because my heart leaped at her words 
0	i was abashed and now they come to mind
0	after nine years i sink my head abashed 
0	there is a queen in china or maybe it s in spain 
0	and birthdays and holidays such praises can be heard
0	of her unblemished lineaments a whiteness with no stain 
0	that she might be that sprightly girl who was trodden by a bird 
0	and there s a score of duchesses surpassing womankind 
0	or who have found a painter to make them so for pay
0	and smooth out stain and blemish with the elegance of his mind 
0	i knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day 
0	the young men every night applaud their gaby s laughing eye 
0	and ruth st denis had more charm although she had poor luck 
0	from nineteen hundred nine or ten pavlova s had the cry 
0	and there s a player in the states who gathers up her cloak
0	and flings herself out of the room when juliet would be bride
0	with all a woman s passion a child s imperious way 
0	and there are but no matter if there are scores beside 
0	i knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day 
0	there s margaret and marjorie and dorothy and nan 
0	a daphne and a mary who live in privacy 
0	one s had her fill of lovers another s had but one 
0	another boasts i pick and choose and have but two or three 
0	if head and limb have beauty and the instep s high and light 
0	they can spread out what sail they please for all i have to say 
0	be but the breakers of men s hearts or engines of delight 
0	i knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day 
0	who is my beauty s equal though that my heart denies 
0	but not the exact likeness the simplicity of a child 
0	and that proud look as though she had gazed into the burning sun 
0	i mourn for that most lonely thing and yet god s will be done 
0	i knew a phoenix in my youth so let them have their day 
0	she might so noble from head
0	to great shapely knees 
0	the long flowing line 
0	have walked to the altar
0	through the holy images
0	at pallas athene s side 
0	or been fit spoil for a centaur
0	drunk with the unmixed wine 
0	there is grey in your hair 
0	young men no longer suddenly catch their breath
0	when you are passing 
0	but maybe some old gaffer mutters a blessing
0	because it was your prayer
0	recovered him upon the bed of death 
0	for your sole sake that all heart s ache have known 
0	and given to others all heart s ache 
0	from meagre girlhood s putting on
0	burdensome beauty for your sole sake
0	heaven has put away the stroke of her doom 
0	so great her portion in that peace you make
0	by merely walking in a room 
0	your beauty can but leave among us
0	vague memories nothing but memories 
0	a young man when the old men are done talking
0	will say to an old man tell me of that lady
0	the poet stubborn with his passion sang us
0	when age might well have chilled his blood 
0	vague memories nothing but memories 
0	but in the grave all all shall be renewed 
0	the certainty that i shall see that lady
0	leaning or standing or walking
0	in the first loveliness of womanhood 
0	and with the fervour of my youthful eyes 
0	has set me muttering like a fool 
0	you are more beautiful than any one
0	and yet your body had a flaw 
0	your small hands were not beautiful 
0	and i am afraid that you will run
0	and paddle to the wrist
0	in that mysterious always brimming lake
0	where those that have obeyed the holy law
0	paddle and are perfect leave unchanged
0	the hands that i have kissed
0	for old sakes sake 
0	the last stroke of midnight dies 
0	all day in the one chair
0	from dream to dream and rhyme to rhyme i have ranged
0	in rambling talk with an image of air 
0	vague memories nothing but memories 
0	others because you did not keep
0	that deep sworn vow have been friends of mine 
0	yet always when i look death in the face 
0	when i clamber to the heights of sleep 
0	or when i grow excited with wine 
0	suddenly i meet your face 
0	this night has been so strange that it seemed
0	as if the hair stood up on my head 
0	from going down of the sun i have dreamed
0	that women laughing or timid or wild 
0	in rustle of lace or silken stuff 
0	climbed up my creaking stair they had read
0	all i had rhymed of that monstrous thing
0	returned and yet unrequited love 
0	they stood in the door and stood between
0	my great wood lecturn and the fire
0	till i could hear their hearts beating 
0	one is a harlot and one a child
0	that never looked upon man with desire 
0	and one it may be a queen 
0	hands do what you re bid 
0	bring the balloon of the mind
0	that bellies and drags in the wind
0	into its narrow shed 
0	come play with me 
0	why should you run
0	through the shaking tree
0	as though i d a gun
0	to strike you dead 
0	when all i would do
0	is to scratch your head
0	and let you go 
0	i think it better that in times like these
0	a poet keep his mouth shut for in truth
0	we have no gift to set a statesman right 
0	he has had enough of meddling who can please
0	a young girl in the indolence of her youth 
0	or an old man upon a winter s night 
0	five and twenty years have gone
0	laid his strong bones down in death
0	by his wife elizabeth
0	in the grey stone tomb he made 
0	and after twenty years they laid
0	in that tomb by him and her 
0	his son george the astrologer 
0	and masons drove from miles away
0	to scatter the acacia spray
0	upon a melancholy man
0	who had ended where his breath began 
0	many a son and daughter lies
0	far from the customary skies 
0	the mall and eades s grammar school 
0	but where is laid the sailor john 
0	that so many lands had known 
0	quiet lands or unquiet seas
0	he never found his rest ashore 
0	moping for one voyage more 
0	where have they laid the sailor john 
0	and yesterday the youngest son 
0	a humorous unambitious man 
0	was buried near the astrologer 
0	and are we now in the tenth year 
0	since he who had been contented long 
0	a nobody in a great throng 
0	decided he would journey home 
0	now that his fiftieth year had come 
0	and mr alfred be again
0	upon the lips of common men
0	who carried in their memory
0	his childhood and his family 
0	at all these death beds women heard
0	a visionary white sea bird
0	lamenting that a man should die 
0	and with that cry i have raised my cry 
0	with the old kindness the old distinguished grace
0	she lies her lovely piteous head amid dull red hair
0	propped upon pillows rouge on the pallor of her face 
0	she would not have us sad because she is lying there 
0	and when she meets our gaze her eyes are laughter lit 
0	her speech a wicked tale that we may vie with her
0	matching our broken hearted wit against her wit 
0	thinking of saints and of petronius arbiter 
0	bring where our beauty lies
0	a new modelled doll or drawing 
0	with a friend s or an enemy s
0	features or maybe showing
0	her features when a tress
0	of dull red hair was flowing
0	over some silken dress
0	cut in the turkish fashion 
0	or it may be like a boy s 
0	we have given the world our passion
0	we have naught for death but toys 
0	because to day is some religious festival
0	heel up and weight on toe must face the wall
0	 pedant in passion learned in old courtesies 
0	vehement and witty she had seemed the venetian lady
0	who had seemed to glide to some intrigue in her red shoes 
0	her domino her panniered skirt copied from longhi 
0	the meditative critic all are on their toes 
0	even our beauty with her turkish trousers on 
0	because the priest must have like every dog his day
0	or keep us all awake with baying at the moon 
0	we and our dolls being but the world were best away 
0	she is playing like a child
0	and penance is the play 
0	fantastical and wild
0	shows her that some one soon
0	will come from the house and say 
0	though play is but half done 
0	 come in and leave the play 
0	she has not grown uncivil
0	as narrow natures would
0	and called the pleasures evil
0	happier days thought good 
0	she knows herself a woman
0	no red and white of a face 
0	or rank raised from a common
0	unreckonable race 
0	and how should her heart fail her
0	or sickness break her will
0	with her dead brother s valour
0	for an example still 
0	when her soul flies to the predestined dancing place
0	 i have no speech but symbol the pagan speech i made
0	amid the dreams of youth let her come face to face 
0	while wondering still to be a shade with grania s shade
0	all but the perils of the woodland flight forgot
0	that made her dermuid dear and some old cardinal
0	pacing with half closed eyelids in a sunny spot
0	who had murmured of giorgione at his latest breath 
0	who have lived in joy and laughed into the face of death 
0	pardon great enemy 
0	without an angry thought
0	we ve carried in our tree 
0	and here and there have bought
0	till all the boughs are gay 
0	and she may look from the bed
0	on pretty things that may
0	please a fantastic head 
0	give her a little grace 
0	what if a laughing eye
0	have looked into your face 
0	it is about to die 
0	on the grey sand beside the shallow stream
0	under your old wind beaten tower where still
0	a lamp burns on beside the open book
0	that michael robartes left you walk in the moon
0	and though you have passed the best of life still trace
0	enthralled by the unconquerable delusion
0	magical shapes 
0	by the help of an image
0	i call to my own opposite summon all
0	that i have handled least least looked upon 
0	and i would find myself and not an image 
0	that is our modern hope and by its light
0	we have lit upon the gentle sensitive mind
0	and lost the old nonchalance of the hand 
0	whether we have chosen chisel pen or brush
0	we are but critics or but half create 
0	timid entangled empty and abashed
0	lacking the countenance of our friends 
0	and yet
0	the chief imagination of christendom
0	dante alighieri so utterly found himself
0	that he has made that hollow face of his
0	more plain to the mind s eye than any face
0	but that of christ 
0	and did he find himself 
0	or was the hunger that had made it hollow
0	a hunger for the apple on the bough
0	most out of reach and is that spectral image
0	the man that lapo and that guido knew 
0	i think he fashioned from his opposite
0	an image that might have been a stony face 
0	staring upon a bedouin s horse hair roof
0	from doored and windowed cliff or half upturned
0	among the coarse grass and the camel dung 
0	he set his chisel to the hardest stone 
0	being mocked by guido for his lecherous life 
0	derided and deriding driven out
0	to climb that stair and eat that bitter bread 
0	he found the unpersuadable justice he found
0	the most exalted lady loved by a man 
0	yet surely there are men who have made their art
0	out of no tragic war lovers of life 
0	impulsive men that look for happiness
0	and sing when they have found it 
0	no not sing 
0	for those that love the world serve it in action 
0	grow rich popular and full of influence 
0	and should they paint or write still it is action 
0	the struggle of the fly in marmalade 
0	the rhetorician would deceive his neighbours 
0	the sentimentalist himself while art
0	is but a vision of reality 
0	what portion in the world can the artist have
0	who has awakened from the common dream
0	but dissipation and despair 
0	and yet
0	no one denies to keats love of the world 
0	remember his deliberate happiness 
0	his art is happy but who knows his mind 
0	i see a schoolboy when i think of him 
0	with face and nose pressed to a sweet shop window 
0	for certainly he sank into his grave
0	his senses and his heart unsatisfied 
0	and made being poor ailing and ignorant 
0	shut out from all the luxury of the world 
0	the coarse bred son of a livery stable keeper 
0	luxuriant song 
0	why should you leave the lamp
0	burning alone beside an open book 
0	and trace these characters upon the sands 
0	a style is found by sedentary toil
0	and by the imitation of great masters 
0	because i seek an image not a book 
0	those men that in their writings are most wise
0	own nothing but their blind stupefied hearts 
0	i call to the mysterious one who yet
0	shall walk the wet sands by the edge of the stream
0	and look most like me being indeed my double 
0	and prove of all imaginable things
0	the most unlike being my anti self 
0	and standing by these characters disclose
0	all that i seek and whisper it as though
0	he were afraid the birds who cry aloud
0	their momentary cries before it is dawn 
0	would carry it away to blasphemous men 
0	god grant a blessing on this tower and cottage
0	and on my heirs if all remain unspoiled

0	their connemara cloth worn out of shape 
0	they had kept a steady pace as though their beds 
0	despite a dwindling and late risen moon 
0	were distant an old man cocked his ear 
0	what made that sound 
0	a rat or water hen
0	splashed or an otter slid into the stream 
0	we are on the bridge that shadow is the tower 
0	and the light proves that he is reading still 
0	he has found after the manner of his kind 
0	mere images chosen this place to live in
0	because it may be of the candle light
0	from the far tower where milton s platonist

0	what he shall never find 
0	why should not you
0	who know it all ring at his door and speak
0	just truth enough to show that his whole life
0	will scarcely find for him a broken crust
0	of all those truths that are your daily bread 
0	and when you have spoken take the roads again 
0	he wrote of me in that extravagant style

0	for there s no human life at the full or the dark 
0	from the first crescent to the half the dream
0	but summons to adventure and the man
0	is always happy like a bird or a beast 
0	but while the moon is rounding towards the full
0	he follows whatever whim s most difficult
0	among whims not impossible and though scarred

0	the strange reward of all that discipline

0	or from some bloody whip in their own hands 
0	they ran from cradle to cradle till at last
0	their beauty dropped out of the loneliness
0	of body and soul 
0	the lovers heart knows that 
0	it must be that the terror in their eyes
0	is memory or foreknowledge of the hour
0	when all is fed with light and heaven is bare 
0	when the moon s full those creatures of the full
0	are met on the waste hills by country men
0	who shudder and hurry by body and soul
0	estranged amid the strangeness of themselves 
0	caught up in contemplation the mind s eye
0	fixed upon images that once were thought

0	that the last servile crescent has set free 
0	because all dark like those that are all light 
0	they are cast beyond the verge and in a cloud 
0	crying to one another like the bats 
0	and having no desire they cannot tell
0	what s good or bad or what it is to triumph
0	at the perfection of one s own obedience 
0	and yet they speak what s blown into the mind 
0	deformed beyond deformity unformed 
0	insipid as the dough before it is baked 
0	they change their bodies at a word 
0	and then 
0	when all the dough has been so kneaded up
0	that it can take what form cook nature fancy
0	the first thin crescent is wheeled round once more 
0	but the escape the song s not finished yet 
0	hunchback and saint and fool are the last crescents 
0	the burning bow that once could shoot an arrow
0	out of the up and down the wagon wheel
0	of beauty s cruelty and wisdom s chatter

0	austerity a place set out for wisdom
0	that he will never find i d play a part 
0	he would never know me after all these years

0	i d stand and mutter there until he caught
0	 hunchback and saint and fool and that they came
0	under the three last crescents of the moon 
0	and then i d stagger out he d crack his wits
0	day after day yet never find the meaning 
0	 and then he laughed to think that what seemed hard
0	should be so simple a bat rose from the hazels
0	and circled round him with its squeaky cry 
0	the light in the tower window was put out 
0	the cat went here and there

0	a roman caesar is held down
0	under this hump

0	eat at my hearthstone
0	and sleep there 
0	and both look up to me alone
0	for learning and defence
0	as i look up to providence 
0	i start out of my sleep to think

0	men that do all by rule 
0	and what can i
0	that am a wandering witted fool
0	but pray to god that he ease
0	my great responsibilities 
0	i slept on my three legged stool by the fire 
0	the speckled cat slept on my knee 
0	we never thought to enquire
0	where the brown hare might be 
0	and whether the door were shut 
0	who knows how she drank the wind
0	stretched up on two legs from the mat 
0	before she had settled her mind
0	to drum with her heel and to leap 
0	had i but awakened from sleep
0	and called her name she had heard 
0	it may be and had not stirred 
0	that now it may be has found
0	the horn s sweet note and the tooth of the hound 
0	this great purple butterfly 
0	in the prison of my hands 
0	has a learning in his eye
0	once he lived a schoolmaster
0	with a stark denying look 
0	a string of scholars went in fear
0	of his great birch and his great book 
0	like the clangour of a bell 
0	sweet and harsh harsh and sweet 
0	that is how he learnt so well
0	to take the roses for his meat 
0	on the grey rock of cashel the mind s eye
0	has called up the cold spirits that are born
0	when the old moon is vanished from the sky
0	and the new still hides her horn 
0	under blank eyes and fingers never still
0	the particular is pounded till it is man 
0	when had i my own will 
0	oh not since life began 
0	constrained arraigned baffled bent and unbent
0	by these wire jointed jaws and limbs of wood 
0	themselves obedient 
0	knowing not evil and good 
0	obedient to some hidden magical breath 
0	they do not even feel so abstract are they 
0	so dead beyond our death 
0	triumph that we obey 
0	on the grey rock of cashel i suddenly saw
0	a sphinx with woman breast and lion paw 
0	a buddha hand at rest 
0	hand lifted up that blest 
0	and right between these two a girl at play
0	that it may be had danced her life away 
0	for now being dead it seemed
0	that she of dancing dreamed 
0	although i saw it all in the mind s eye
0	there can be nothing solider till i die 
0	i saw by the moon s light
0	now at its fifteenth night 
0	one lashed her tail her eyes lit by the moon
0	gazed upon all things known all things unknown 
0	in triumph of intellect
0	with motionless head erect 
0	that other s moonlit eyeballs never moved 
0	being fixed on all things loved all things unloved 
0	yet little peace he had
0	for those that love are sad 
0	oh little did they care who danced between 
0	and little she by whom her dance was seen
0	so that she danced no thought 
0	body perfection brought 
0	for what but eye and ear silence the mind
0	with the minute particulars of mankind 
0	mind moved yet seemed to stop
0	as twere a spinning top 
0	in contemplation had those three so wrought
0	upon a moment and so stretched it out
0	that they time overthrown 
0	were dead yet flesh and bone 
0	i knew that i had seen had seen at last
0	that girl my unremembering nights hold fast
0	or else my dreams that fly 
0	if i should rub an eye 
0	and yet in flying fling into my meat
0	as though i had been undone
0	by homer s paragon
0	who never gave the burning town a thought 
0	to such a pitch of folly i am brought 
0	being caught between the pull
0	of the dark moon and the full 
0	the commonness of thought and images
0	that have the frenzy of our western seas 
0	thereon i made my moan 
0	and after kissed a stone 
0	and after that arranged it in a song
0	seeing that i ignorant for so long 
0	had been rewarded thus
0	in cormac s ruined house 
0	set up and electrotyped published november 
0	to a friend whose work has come to nothing
0	beggar to beggar cried
0	the hour before dawn
0	to a child dancing in the wind
0	that the night come
0	a woman homer sung
0	the fascination of what s difficult
0	the coming of wisdom with time
0	on hearing that the students of our new university
0	have joined the ancient order of hibernians
0	upon a house shaken by the land agitation
0	a friend s illness
0	all things can tempt me
0	the young man s song
0	 in dreams begins responsibility 
0	 how am i fallen from myself for a long time now 
0	 i have not seen the prince of chang in my dreams 
0	 pardon old fathers if you still remain 
0	 somewhere in ear shot for the story s end 
0	 old dublin merchant free of ten and four 
0	 or trading out of galway into spain 
0	 and country scholar robert emmet s friend 
0	 a hundred year old memory to the poor 
0	 traders or soldiers who have left me blood 
0	 that has not passed through any huxter s loin 
0	 pardon and you that did not weigh the cost 
0	 old butlers when you took to horse and stood 
0	 beside the brackish waters of the boyne 
0	 till your bad master blenched and all was lost 
0	 you merchant skipper that leaped overboard 
0	 after a ragged hat in biscay bay 
0	 you most of all silent and fierce old man 
0	 because you were the spectacle that stirred 
0	 my fancy and set my boyish lips to say 
0	 only the wasteful virtues earn the sun 
0	 pardon that for a barren passion s sake 
0	 although i have come close on forty nine 
0	 i have no child i have nothing but a book 
0	 nothing but that to prove your blood and mine 
0	 poets with whom i learned my trade 
0	 here s an old story i ve re made 
0	 imagining twould better please 
0	 your ears than stories now in fashion 
0	 though you may think i waste my breath 
0	 pretending that there can be passion 
0	 that has more life in it than death 
0	 and though at bottling of your wine 
0	 the bow legged goban had no say 
0	 the moral s yours because it s mine 
0	when cups went round at close of day 
0	is not that how good stories run 
0	somewhere within some hollow hill 
0	if books speak truth in slievenamon 
0	but let that be the gods were still
0	and sleepy having had their meal 
0	and smoky torches made a glare
0	on painted pillars on a deal
0	of fiddles and of flutes hung there
0	by the ancient holy hands that brought them
0	from murmuring murias on cups 
0	old goban hammered them and wrought them 
0	and put his pattern round their tops
0	to hold the wine they buy of him 
0	but from the juice that made them wise
0	all those had lifted up the dim
0	imaginations of their eyes 
0	for one that was like woman made
0	before their sleepy eyelids ran
0	and trembling with her passion said 
0	 come out and dig for a dead man 
0	who s burrowing somewhere in the ground 
0	and mock him to his face and then
0	hollo him on with horse and hound 
0	for he is the worst of all dead men 
0	 we should be dazed and terror struck 
0	 if we but saw in dreams that room 
0	 those wine drenched eyes and curse our luck 
0	 that emptied all our days to come 
0	 i knew a woman none could please 
0	 because she dreamed when but a child 
0	 of men and women made like these 
0	 and after when her blood ran wild 
0	 had ravelled her own story out 
0	 and said in two or in three years 
0	 i need must marry some poor lout 
0	 and having said it burst in tears 
0	 since tavern comrades you have died 
0	 maybe your images have stood 
0	 mere bone and muscle thrown aside 
0	 before that roomful or as good 
0	 you had to face your ends when young 
0	 twas wine or women or some curse 
0	 but never made a poorer song 
0	 that you might have a heavier purse 
0	 nor gave loud service to a cause 
0	 that you might have a troop of friends 
0	 you kept the muses sterner laws 
0	 and unrepenting faced your ends 
0	 and therefore earned the right and yet 
0	 dowson and johnson most i praise 
0	 to troop with those the world s forgot 
0	 and copy their proud steady gaze 
0	 the danish troop was driven out
0	between the dawn and dusk she said 
0	 although the event was long in doubt 
0	although the king of ireland s dead
0	and half the kings before sundown
0	all was accomplished 
0	 when this day
0	murrough the king of ireland s son 
0	foot after foot was giving way 
0	he and his best troops back to back
0	had perished there but the danes ran 
0	stricken with panic from the attack 
0	the shouting of an unseen man 
0	and being thankful murrough found 
0	led by a footsole dipped in blood
0	that had made prints upon the ground 
0	where by old thorn trees that man stood 
0	and though when he gazed here and there 
0	he had but gazed on thorn trees spoke 
0	 who is the friend that seems but air
0	and yet could give so fine a stroke 
0	thereon a young man met his eye 
0	who said because she held me in
0	her love and would not have me die 
0	rock nurtured aoife took a pin 
0	and pushing it into my shirt 
0	promised that for a pin s sake 
0	no man should see to do me hurt 
0	but there it s gone i will not take
0	the fortune that had been my shame
0	seeing king s son what wounds you have 
0	 twas roundly spoke but when night came
0	he had betrayed me to his grave 
0	for he and the king s son were dead 
0	i d promised him two hundred years 
0	and when for all i d done or said 
0	and these immortal eyes shed tears 
0	he claimed his country s need was most 
0	i d save his life yet for the sake
0	of a new friend he has turned a ghost 
0	what does he care if my heart break 
0	that we may harry him thereon
0	she cast herself upon the ground
0	and rent her clothes and made her moan 
0	 why are they faithless when their might
0	is from the holy shades that rove
0	the grey rock and the windy light 
0	why should the faithfullest heart most love
0	the bitter sweetness of false faces 
0	why must the lasting love what passes 
0	why are the gods by men betrayed 
0	but thereon every god stood up
0	with a slow smile and without sound 
0	and stretching forth his arm and cup
0	to where she moaned upon the ground 
0	suddenly drenched her to the skin 
0	and she with goban s wine adrip 
0	no more remembering what had been 
0	stared at the gods with laughing lip 
0	 i have kept my faith though faith was tried 
0	 to that rock born rock wandering foot 
0	 and the world s altered since you died 
0	 and i am in no good repute 
0	 with the loud host before the sea 
0	 that think sword strokes were better meant 
0	 than lover s music let that be 
0	 so that the wandering foot s content 
0	king eochaid came at sundown to a wood
0	westward of tara hurrying to his queen
0	he had out ridden his war wasted men
0	that with empounded cattle trod the mire 
0	and where beech trees had mixed a pale green light
0	with the ground ivy s blue he saw a stag
0	whiter than curds its eyes the tint of the sea 
0	because it stood upon his path and seemed
0	more hands in height than any stag in the world
0	he sat with tightened rein and loosened mouth
0	upon his trembling horse then drove the spur 
0	but the stag stooped and ran at him and passed 
0	rending the horse s flank king eochaid reeled
0	then drew his sword to hold its levelled point
0	against the stag when horn and steel were met
0	the horn resounded as though it had been silver 
0	a sweet miraculous terrifying sound 
0	horn locked in sword they tugged and struggled there
0	as though a stag and unicorn were met
0	until at last the double horns drawn backward 
0	butted below the single and so pierced
0	the entrails of the horse dropping his sword
0	king eochaid seized the horns in his strong hands
0	and stared into the sea green eye and so
0	hither and thither to and fro they trod
0	till all the place was beaten into mire 
0	the strong thigh and the agile thigh were met 
0	the hands that gathered up the might of the world 
0	and hoof and horn that had sucked in their speed
0	amid the elaborate wilderness of the air 
0	through bush they plunged and over ivied root 
0	and where the stone struck fire while in the leaves
0	a squirrel whinnied and a bird screamed out 
0	but when at last he forced those sinewy flanks
0	against a beech bole he threw down the beast
0	and knelt above it with drawn knife on the instant
0	it vanished like a shadow and a cry
0	so mournful that it seemed the cry of one
0	who had lost some unimaginable treasure
0	wandered between the blue and the green leaf
0	and climbed into the air crumbling away 
0	till all had seemed a shadow or a vision
0	but for the trodden mire the pool of blood 
0	the disembowelled horse 
0	king eochaid ran 
0	toward peopled tara nor stood to draw his breath
0	until he came before the painted wall 
0	the posts of polished yew circled with bronze 
0	of the great door but though the hanging lamps
0	showed their faint light through the unshuttered windows 
0	nor door nor mouth nor slipper made a noise 
0	nor on the ancient beaten paths that wound
0	from well side or from plough land was there noise 
0	and there had been no sound of living thing
0	before him or behind but that far off
0	on the horizon edge bellowed the herds 
0	knowing that silence brings no good to kings 
0	and mocks returning victory he passed
0	between the pillars with a beating heart
0	and saw where in the midst of the great hall
0	pale faced alone upon a bench edain
0	sat upright with a sword before her feet 
0	her hands on either side had gripped the bench 
0	her eyes were cold and steady her lips tight 
0	some passion had made her stone hearing a foot
0	she started and then knew whose foot it was 
0	but when he thought to take her in his arms
0	she motioned him afar and rose and spoke 
0	 i have sent among the fields or to the woods
0	the fighting men and servants of this house 
0	for i would have your judgment upon one
0	who is self accused if she be innocent
0	she would not look in any known man s face
0	till judgment has been given and if guilty 
0	will never look again on known man s face 
0	and at these words he paled as she had paled 
0	knowing that he should find upon her lips
0	the meaning of that monstrous day 
0	then she 
0	 you brought me where your brother ardan sat
0	always in his one seat and bid me care him
0	through that strange illness that had fixed him there 
0	and should he die to heap his burial mound
0	and carve his name in ogham eochaid said 
0	 he lives he lives and is a healthy man 
0	 while i have him and you it matters little
0	what man you have lost what evil you have found 
0	 i bid them make his bed under this roof
0	and carried him his food with my own hands 
0	and so the weeks passed by but when i said
0	 what is this trouble he would answer nothing 
0	though always at my words his trouble grew 
0	and i but asked the more till he cried out 
0	weary of many questions there are things
0	then i replied although you hide a secret 
0	hopeless and dear or terrible to think on 
0	speak it that i may send through the wide world
0	for medicine thereon he cried aloud 
0	 day after day you question me and i 
0	because there is such a storm amid my thoughts
0	i shall be carried in the gust command 
0	forbid beseech and waste my breath then i 
0	 although the thing that you have hid were evil 
0	the speaking of it could be no great wrong 
0	and evil must it be if done twere worse
0	than mound and stone that keep all virtue in 
0	and loosen on us dreams that waste our life 
0	shadows and shows that can but turn the brain 
0	but finding him still silent i stooped down
0	and whispering that none but he should hear 
0	said if a woman has put this on you 
0	my men whether it please her or displease 
0	and though they have to cross the loughlan waters
0	and take her in the middle of armed men 
0	shall make her look upon her handiwork 
0	that she may quench the rick she has fired and though
0	she may have worn silk clothes or worn a crown 
0	she ll not be proud knowing within her heart
0	that our sufficient portion of the world
0	is that we give although it be brief giving 
0	happiness to children and to men 
0	then he driven by his thought beyond his thought 
0	and speaking what he would not though he would 
0	sighed you even you yourself could work the cure 
0	and at those words i rose and i went out
0	and for nine days he had food from other hands 
0	and for nine days my mind went whirling round
0	the one disastrous zodiac muttering
0	that the immedicable mound s beyond
0	our questioning beyond our pity even 
0	but when nine days had gone i stood again
0	before his chair and bending down my head
0	told him that when orion rose and all
0	the women of his household were asleep 
0	to go for hope would give his limbs the power 
0	to an old empty woodman s house that s hidden
0	close to a clump of beech trees in the wood
0	westward of tara there to await a friend
0	that could as he had told her work his cure
0	and would be no harsh friend 
0	when night had deepened 
0	i groped my way through boughs and over roots 
0	till oak and hazel ceased and beech began 
0	and found the house a sputtering torch within 
0	and stretched out sleeping on a pile of skins
0	ardan and though i called to him and tried
0	to shake him out of sleep i could not rouse him 
0	i waited till the night was on the turn 
0	then fearing that some labourer on his way
0	to plough or pasture land might see me there 
0	went out 
0	among the ivy covered rocks 
0	as on the blue light of a sword a man
0	who had unnatural majesty and eyes
0	like the eyes of some great kite scouring the woods 
0	stood on my path trembling from head to foot
0	i gazed at him like grouse upon a kite 
0	but with a voice that had unnatural music 
0	 a weary wooing and a long he said 
0	 speaking of love through other lips and looking
0	under the eyelids of another for it was my craft
0	that put a passion in the sleeper there 
0	and when i had got my will and drawn you here 
0	where i may speak to you alone my craft
0	sucked up the passion out of him again
0	and left mere sleep he ll wake when the sun wakes 
0	push out his vigorous limbs and rub his eyes 
0	and wonder what has ailed him these twelve months 
0	i cowered back upon the wall in terror 
0	but that sweet sounding voice ran on woman 
0	i was your husband when you rode the air 
0	danced in the whirling foam and in the dust 
0	in days you have not kept in memory 
0	being betrayed into a cradle and i come
0	that i may claim you as my wife again 
0	i was no longer terrified his voice
0	had half awakened some old memory 
0	yet answered him i am king eochaid s wife
0	and with him have found every happiness
0	women can find with a most masterful voice 
0	that made the body seem as it were a string
0	under a bow he cried what happiness
0	can lovers have that know their happiness
0	our sudden palaces in the still air
0	pleasure itself can bring no weariness 
0	nor can time waste the cheek nor is there foot
0	that has grown weary of the whirling dance 
0	nor an unlaughing mouth but mine that mourns 
0	among those mouths that sing their sweethearts praise 
0	your empty bed how should i love i answered 
0	 were it not that when the dawn has lit my bed
0	and shown my husband sleeping there i have sighed 
0	 your strength and nobleness will pass away 
0	or how should love be worth its pains were it not
0	that when he has fallen asleep within my arms 
0	being wearied out i love in man the child 
0	what can they know of love that do not know
0	she builds her nest upon a narrow ledge
0	above a windy precipice then he 
0	 seeing that when you come to the death bed
0	you must return whether you would or no 
0	this human life blotted from memory 
0	why must i live some thirty forty years 
0	alone with all this useless happiness 
0	thereon he seized me in his arms but i
0	thrust him away with both my hands and cried 
0	 never will i believe there is any change
0	can blot out of my memory this life
0	sweetened by death but if i could believe
0	that were a double hunger in my lips
0	for what is doubly brief 
0	and now the shape 
0	my hands were pressed to vanished suddenly 
0	i staggered but a beech tree stayed my fall 
0	and clinging to it i could hear the cocks
0	crow upon tara 
0	king eochaid bowed his head
0	and thanked her for her kindness to his brother 
0	for that she promised and for that refused 
0	thereon the bellowing of the empounded herds
0	rose round the walls and through the bronze ringed door
0	jostled and shouted those war wasted men 
0	and in the midst king eochaid s brother stood 
0	he d heard that din on the horizon s edge
0	and ridden towards it being ignorant 
0	you gave but will not give again
0	until enough of paudeen s pence
0	by biddy s halfpennies have lain
0	to be some sort of evidence 
0	before you ll put your guineas down 
0	that things it were a pride to give
0	are what the blind and ignorant town
0	imagines best to make it thrive 
0	what cared duke ercole that bid
0	his mummers to the market place 
0	what th onion sellers thought or did
0	so that his plautus set the pace
0	for the italian comedies 
0	and guidobaldo when he made
0	that grammar school of courtesies
0	where wit and beauty learned their trade
0	upon urbino s windy hill 
0	had sent no runners to and fro
0	that he might learn the shepherds will 
0	and when they drove out cosimo 
0	indifferent how the rancour ran 
0	he gave the hours they had set free
0	to michelozzo s latest plan
0	whence turbulent italy should draw
0	delight in art whose end is peace 
0	in logic and in natural law
0	by sucking at the dugs of greece 
0	your open hand but shows our loss 
0	for he knew better how to live 
0	let paudeens play at pitch and toss 
0	look up in the sun s eye and give
0	what the exultant heart calls good
0	that some new day may breed the best
0	because you gave not what they would
0	but the right twigs for an eagle s nest 
0	what need you being come to sense 
0	but fumble in a greasy till
0	and add the halfpence to the pence
0	and prayer to shivering prayer until
0	you have dried the marrow from the bone 
0	for men were born to pray and save 
0	romantic ireland s dead and gone 
0	it s with o leary in the grave 
0	yet they were of a different kind
0	the names that stilled your childish play 
0	they have gone about the world like wind 
0	but little time had they to pray
0	for whom the hangman s rope was spun 
0	and what god help us could they save 
0	romantic ireland s dead and gone 
0	it s with o leary in the grave 
0	was it for this the wild geese spread
0	the grey wing upon every tide 
0	for this that all that blood was shed 
0	for this edward fitzgerald died 
0	all that delirium of the brave 
0	romantic ireland s dead and gone 
0	it s with o leary in the grave 
0	yet could we turn the years again 
0	and call those exiles as they were 
0	in all their loneliness and pain
0	you d cry some woman s yellow hair
0	has maddened every mother s son 
0	they weighed so lightly what they gave 
0	but let them be they re dead and gone 
0	they re with o leary in the grave 
0	now all the truth is out 
0	be secret and take defeat
0	from any brazen throat 
0	for how can you compete 
0	being honour bred with one
0	who were it proved he lies 
0	were neither shamed in his own
0	nor in his neighbours eyes 
0	bred to a harder thing
0	than triumph turn away
0	and like a laughing string
0	whereon mad fingers play
0	amid a place of stone 
0	be secret and exult 
0	because of all things known
0	that is most difficult 
0	indignant at the fumbling wits the obscure spite
0	of our old paudeen in his shop i stumbled blind
0	among the stones and thorn trees under morning light 
0	until a curlew cried and in the luminous wind
0	a curlew answered and suddenly thereupon i thought
0	that on the lonely height where all are in god s eye 
0	there cannot be confusion of our sound forgot 
0	a single soul that lacks a sweet crystaline cry 
0	if you have revisited the town thin shade 
0	whether to look upon your monument
0	 i wonder if the builder has been paid 
0	or happier thoughted when the day is spent
0	to drink of that salt breath out of the sea
0	when grey gulls flit about instead of men 
0	and the gaunt houses put on majesty 
0	let these content you and be gone again 
0	for they are at their old tricks yet 
0	a man
0	of your own passionate serving kind who had brought
0	in his full hands what had they only known 
0	had given their children s children loftier thought 
0	sweeter emotion working in their veins
0	like gentle blood has been driven from the place 
0	and insult heaped upon him for his pains
0	 all rights reserved 
0	and for his open handedness disgrace 
0	an old foul mouth that slandered you had set
0	the pack upon him 
0	go unquiet wanderer 
0	and gather the glasnevin coverlet
0	about your head till the dust stops your ear 
0	the time for you to taste of that salt breath
0	and listen at the corners has not come 
0	you had enough of sorrow before death 
0	away away you are safer in the tomb 
0	we have cried in our despair
0	that men desert 
0	for some trivial affair
0	or noisy insolent sport 
0	beauty that we have won
0	from bitterest hours 
0	yet we had we walked within
0	those topless towers
0	where helen walked with her boy 
0	had given but as the rest
0	of the men and women of troy 
0	a word and a jest 
0	once when midnight smote the air 
0	eunuchs ran through hell and met
0	from thoroughfare to thoroughfare 
0	while that great juan galloped by 
0	and like these to rail and sweat
0	staring upon his sinewy thigh 
0	 though to my feathers in the wet 
0	 i have stood here from break of day 
0	 i have not found a thing to eat 
0	 for only rubbish comes my way 
0	 am i to live on lebeen lone 
0	 muttered the old crane of gort 
0	 for all my pains on lebeen lone 
0	king guari walked amid his court
0	the palace yard and river side
0	and there to three old beggars said 
0	 you that have wandered far and wide
0	can ravel out what s in my head 
0	do men who least desire get most 
0	or get the most who most desire 
0	a beggar said they get the most
0	whom man or devil cannot tire 
0	and what could make their muscles taut
0	unless desire had made them so 
0	but guari laughed with secret thought 
0	 if that be true as it seems true 
0	one of you three is a rich man 
0	for he shall have a thousand pounds
0	who is first asleep if but he can
0	sleep before the third noon sounds 
0	and thereon merry as a bird 
0	with his old thoughts king guari went
0	from river side and palace yard
0	and left them to their argument 
0	 and if i win one beggar said 
0	 though i am old i shall persuade
0	a pretty girl to share my bed 
0	the second i shall learn a trade 
0	the third i ll hurry to the course
0	among the other gentlemen 
0	and lay it all upon a horse 
0	the second i have thought again 
0	a farmer has more dignity 
0	one to another sighed and cried 
0	the exorbitant dreams of beggary 
0	that idleness had borne to pride 
0	sang through their teeth from noon to noon 
0	and when the second twilight brought
0	the frenzy of the beggars moon
0	they closed their blood shot eyes for naught 
0	one beggar cried you re shamming sleep 
0	and thereupon their anger grew
0	till they were whirling in a heap 
0	they d mauled and bitten the night through
0	or sat upon their heels to rail 
0	and when old guari came and stood
0	before the three to end this tale 
0	they were commingling lice and blood 
0	 time s up he cried and all the three
0	with blood shot eyes upon him stared 
0	 time s up he cried and all the three
0	fell down upon the dust and snored 
0	 maybe i shall be lucky yet 
0	 now they are silent said the crane 
0	 though to my feathers in the wet 
0	 i ve stood as i were made of stone 
0	 and seen the rubbish run about 
0	 it s certain there are trout somewhere 
0	 and maybe i shall take a trout 
0	 if but i do not seem to care 
0	three old hermits took the air
0	by a cold and desolate sea 
0	first was muttering a prayer 
0	second rummaged for a flea 
0	on a windy stone the third 
0	giddy with his hundredth year 
0	sang unnoticed like a bird 
0	 though the door of death is near
0	and what waits behind the door 
0	three times in a single day
0	i though upright on the shore 
0	fall asleep when i should pray 
0	so the first but now the second 
0	 we re but given what we have earned
0	when all thoughts and deeds are reckoned 
0	so it s plain to be discerned
0	that the shades of holy men 
0	who have failed being weak of will 
0	pass the door of birth again 
0	and are plagued by crowds until
0	they ve the passion to escape 
0	moaned the other they are thrown
0	into some most fearful shape 
0	but the second mocked his moan 
0	 they are not changed to anything 
0	having loved god once but maybe 
0	to a poet or a king
0	or a witty lovely lady 
0	while he d rummaged rags and hair 
0	caught and cracked his flea the third 
0	giddy with his hundredth year
0	sang unnoticed like a bird 
0	 time to put off the world and go somewhere
0	and find my health again in the sea air 
0	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
0	 and make my soul before my pate is bare 
0	 and get a comfortable wife and house
0	to rid me of the devil in my shoes 
0	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
0	 and the worse devil that is between my thighs 
0	 and though i d marry with a comely lass 
0	she need not be too comely let it pass 
0	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
0	 but there s a devil in a looking glass 
0	 nor should she be too rich because the rich
0	are driven by wealth as beggars by the itch 
0	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
0	 and cannot have a humorous happy speech 
0	 and there i ll grow respected at my ease 
0	and hear amid the garden s nightly peace 
0	beggar to beggar cried being frenzy struck 
0	 the wind blown clamor of the barnacle geese 
0	 the man that i praise 
0	cries out the empty well 
0	 lives all his days
0	where a hand on the bell
0	can call the milch cows
0	to the comfortable door of his house 
0	dry stones in a well 
0	 the man that i praise 
0	cries out the leafless tree 
0	 has married and stays
0	by an old hearth and he
0	on naught has set store
0	but children and dogs on the floor 
0	a withered tree 
0	as i came over windy gap
0	they threw a halfpenny into my cap 
0	for i am running to paradise 
0	and all that i need do is to wish
0	and somebody puts his hand in the dish
0	to throw me a bit of salted fish 
0	and there the king is but as the beggar 
0	my brother mourteen is worn out
0	with skelping his big brawling lout 
0	and i am running to paradise 
0	a poor life do what he can 
0	and though he keep a dog and a gun 
0	a serving maid and a serving man 
0	and there the king is but as the beggar 
0	poor men have grown to be rich men 
0	and rich men grown to be poor again 
0	and i am running to paradise 
0	and many a darling wit s grown dull
0	that tossed a bare heel when at school 
0	now it has filled an old sock full 
0	and there the king is but as the beggar 
0	the wind is old and still at play
0	while i must hurry upon my way 
0	for i am running to paradise 
0	yet never have i lit on a friend
0	to take my fancy like the wind
0	that nobody can buy or bind 
0	and there the king is but as the beggar 
0	a one legged one armed one eyed man 
0	a bundle of rags upon a crutch 
0	stumbled on windy cruachan
0	cursing the wind it was as much
0	as the one sturdy leg could do
0	to keep him upright while he cursed 
0	he had counted where long years ago
0	queen maeve s nine maines had been nursed 
0	a pair of lapwings one old sheep
0	and not a house to the plain s edge 
0	when close to his right hand a heap
0	of grey stones and a rocky ledge
0	reminded him that he could make 
0	if he but shifted a few stones 
0	a shelter till the daylight broke 
0	but while he fumbled with the stones
0	they toppled over were it not
0	i have a lucky wooden shin
0	i had been hurt and toppling brought
0	before his eyes where stones had been 
0	a dark deep hole in the rock s face 
0	he gave a gasp and thought to run 
0	being certain it was no right place
0	that s stuffed with all that s old and bad 
0	and yet stood still because inside
0	he had seen a red haired jolly lad
0	in some outlandish coat beside
0	a ladle and a tub of beer 
0	plainly no phantom by his look 
0	so with a laugh at his own fear
0	he crawled into that pleasant nook 
0	young red head stretched himself to yawn
0	and murmured may god curse the night
0	that s grown uneasy near the dawn
0	so that it seems even i sleep light 
0	and who are you that wakens me 
0	has one of maeve s nine brawling sons
0	grown tired of his own company 
0	but let him keep his grave for once
0	i have to find the sleep i have lost 
0	and then at last being wide awake 
0	 i took you for a brawling ghost 
0	say what you please but from day break
0	i ll sleep another century 
0	the beggar deaf to all but hope
0	went down upon a hand and knee
0	and took the wooden ladle up
0	and would have dipped it in the beer
0	but the other pushed his hand aside 
0	 before you have dipped it in the beer
0	that sacred goban brewed he cried 
0	 i d have assurance that you are able
0	to value beer i will have no fool
0	dipping his nose into my ladle
0	because he has stumbled on this hole
0	in the bad hour before the dawn 
0	if you but drink that beer and say
0	i will sleep until the winter s gone 
0	or maybe to midsummer day
0	you will sleep that length and at the first
0	i waited so for that or this 
0	because the weather was a cursed
0	or i had no woman there to kiss 
0	and slept for half a year or so 
0	but year by year i found that less
0	gave me such pleasure i d forgo
0	even a half hour s nothingness 
0	and when at one year s end i found
0	i had not waked a single minute 
0	i chose this burrow under ground 
0	i will sleep away all time within it 
0	my sleep were now nine centuries
0	but for those mornings when i find
0	the lapwing at their foolish cries
0	and the sheep bleating at the wind
0	as when i also played the fool 
0	the beggar in a rage began
0	upon his hunkers in the hole 
0	 it s plain that you are no right man
0	to mock at everything i love
0	as if it were not worth the doing 
0	i d have a merry life enough
0	if a good easter wind were blowing 
0	and though the winter wind is bad
0	i should not be too down in the mouth
0	for anything you did or said
0	if but this wind were in the south 
0	but the other cried you long for spring
0	or that the wind would shift a point
0	and do not know that you would bring 
0	if time were suppler in the joint 
0	neither the spring nor the south wind
0	but the hour when you shall pass away
0	and leave no smoking wick behind 
0	for all life longs for the last day
0	and there s no man but cocks his ear
0	to know when michael s trumpet cries
0	that flesh and bone may disappear 
0	and souls as if they were but sighs 
0	and there be nothing but god left 
0	but i alone being blessed keep
0	like some old rabbit to my cleft
0	and wait him in a drunken sleep 
0	he dipped his ladle in the tub
0	and drank and yawned and stretched him out 
0	the other shouted you would rob
0	my life of every pleasant thought
0	and every comfortable thing
0	and so take that and that thereon
0	he gave him a great pummelling 
0	but might have pummelled at a stone
0	for all the sleeper knew or cared 
0	and after heaped the stones again
0	and cursed and prayed and prayed and cursed 
0	 oh god if he got loose and then
0	in fury and in panic fled
0	and gave god thanks that overhead
0	the clouds were brightening with the dawn 
0	 song from an unfinished play 
0	my mother dandled me and sang 
0	 how young it is how young 
0	and made a golden cradle
0	that on a willow swung 
0	 he went away my mother sang 
0	 when i was brought to bed 
0	and all the while her needle pulled
0	the gold and silver thread 
0	she pulled the thread and bit the thread
0	and made a golden gown 
0	and wept because she had dreamt that i
0	was born to wear a crown 
0	 when she was got my mother sang 
0	 i heard a sea mew cry 
0	and saw a flake of the yellow foam
0	that dropped upon my thigh 
0	how therefore could she help but braid
0	the gold into my hair 
0	and dream that i should carry
0	the golden top of care 
0	hope that you may understand 
0	what can books of men that wive
0	in a dragon guarded land 
0	paintings of the dolphin drawn
0	sea nymphs in their pearly waggons
0	do but awake a hope to live
0	that had gone
0	with the dragons 
0	toil and grow rich 
0	what s that but to lie
0	with a foul witch
0	and after drained dry 
0	to be brought
0	to the chamber where
0	lies one long sought
0	with despair 
0	what s riches to him
0	that has made a great peacock
0	with the pride of his eye 
0	the wind beaten stone grey 
0	and desolate three rock
0	would nourish his whim 
0	amid wet rocks and heather 
0	his ghost will be gay
0	adding feather to feather
0	for the pride of his eye 
0	pour wine and dance if manhood still have pride 
0	bring roses if the rose be yet in bloom 
0	the cataract smokes upon the mountain side 
0	our father rosicross is in his tomb 
0	pull down the blinds bring fiddle and clarionet
0	that there be no foot silent in the room
0	nor mouth from kissing nor from wine unwet 
0	our father rosicross is in his tomb 
0	in vain in vain the cataract still cries
0	the everlasting taper lights the gloom 
0	all wisdom shut into his onyx eyes
0	our father rosicross sleeps in his tomb 
0	dance there upon the shore 
0	what need have you to care
0	for wind or water s roar 
0	and tumble out your hair
0	that the salt drops have wet 
0	being young you have not known
0	the fool s triumph nor yet
0	love lost as soon as won 
0	nor the best labourer dead
0	and all the sheaves to bind 
0	what need have you to dread
0	the monstrous crying of wind 
0	has no one said those daring
0	kind eyes should be more learn d 
0	or warned you how despairing
0	the moths are when they are burned 
0	i could have warned you but you are young 
0	so we speak a different tongue 
0	o you will take whatever s offered
0	and dream that all the world s a friend 
0	suffer as your mother suffered 
0	be as broken in the end 
0	but i am old and you are young 
0	and i speak a barbarous tongue 
0	the moments passed as at a play 
0	i had the wisdom love brings forth 
0	i had my share of mother wit
0	and yet for all that i could say 
0	and though i had her praise for it 
0	a cloud blown from the cut throat north
0	suddenly hid love s moon away 
0	believing every word i said
0	i praised her body and her mind
0	till pride had made her eyes grow bright 
0	and pleasure made her cheeks grow red 
0	and vanity her footfall light 
0	yet we for all that praise could find
0	nothing but darkness overhead 
0	we sat as silent as a stone 
0	we knew though she d not said a word 
0	that even the best of love must die 
0	and had been savagely undone
0	were it not that love upon the cry
0	of a most ridiculous little bird
0	tore from the clouds his marvellous moon 
0	although crowds gathered once if she but showed her face 
0	and even old men s eyes grew dim this hand alone 
0	babbling of fallen majesty records what s gone 
0	the lineaments a heart that laughter has made sweet 
0	these these remain but i record what s gone a crowd
0	will gather and not know it walks the very street
0	whereon a thing once walked that seemed a burning cloud 
0	now must i these three praise 
0	three women that have wrought
0	what joy is in my days 
0	one that no passing thought 
0	nor those unpassing cares 
0	no not in these fifteen
0	many times troubled years 
0	could ever come between
0	heart and delighted heart 
0	and one because her hand
0	had strength that could unbind
0	what none can understand 
0	what none can have and thrive 
0	youth s dreamy load till she
0	so changed me that i live
0	labouring in ecstasy 
0	and what of her that took
0	all till my youth was gone
0	with scarce a pitying look 
0	how should i praise that one 
0	when day begins to break
0	i count my good and bad 
0	being wakeful for her sake 
0	remembering what she had 
0	what eagle look still shows 
0	while up from my heart s root
0	so great a sweetness flows
0	i shake from head to foot 
0	suddenly i saw the cold and rook delighting heaven
0	that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice 
0	and thereupon imagination and heart were driven
0	so wild that every casual thought of that and this
0	vanished and left but memories that should be out of season
0	with the hot blood of youth of love crossed long ago 
0	and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason 
0	until i cried and trembled and rocked to and fro 
0	riddled with light ah when the ghost begins to quicken 
0	confusion of the death bed over is it sent
0	out naked on the roads as the books say and stricken
0	by the injustice of the skies for punishment 
0	she lived in storm and strife 
0	her soul had such desire
0	for what proud death may bring
0	that it could not endure
0	the common good of life 
0	but lived as twere a king
0	that packed his marriage day
0	with banneret and pennon 
0	trumpet and kettledrum 
0	and the outrageous cannon 
0	to bundle time away
0	that the night come 
0	being out of heart with government
0	i took a broken root to fling
0	where the proud wayward squirrel went 
0	taking delight that he could spring 
0	and he with that low whinnying sound
0	that is like laughter sprang again
0	and so to the other tree at a bound 
0	nor the tame will nor timid brain 
0	bred that fierce tooth and cleanly limb
0	and threw him up to laugh on the bough 
0	no government appointed him 
0	now as at all times i can see in the mind s eye 
0	in their stiff painted clothes the pale unsatisfied ones
0	appear and disappear in the blue depth of the sky
0	with all their ancient faces like rain beaten stones 
0	and all their helms of silver hovering side by side 
0	and all their eyes still fixed hoping to find once more 
0	being by calvary s turbulence unsatisfied 
0	the uncontrollable mystery on the bestial floor 
0	a doll in the doll maker s house
0	looks at the cradle and balls 
0	 that is an insult to us 
0	but the oldest of all the dolls
0	who had seen being kept for show 
0	generations of his sort 
0	out screams the whole shelf although
0	there s not a man can report
0	evil of this place 
0	the man and the woman bring
0	hither to our disgrace 
0	a noisy and filthy thing 
0	hearing him groan and stretch
0	the doll maker s wife is aware
0	her husband has heard the wretch 
0	and crouched by the arm of his chair 
0	she murmurs into his ear 
0	head upon shoulder leant 
0	 my dear my dear oh dear 
0	it was an accident 
0	i made my song a coat
0	covered with embroideries
0	out of old mythologies
0	from heel to throat 
0	but the fools caught it 
0	wore it in the world s eye
0	as though they d wrought it 
0	song let them take it
0	for there s more enterprise
0	in walking naked 
0	 while i from that reed throated whisperer 
0	 who comes at need although not now as once 
0	 a clear articulation in the air 
0	 but inwardly surmise companions 
0	 beyond the fling of the dull ass s hoof 
0	 ben jonson s phrase and find when june is come 
0	 at kyle na no under that ancient roof 
0	 a sterner conscience and a friendlier home 
0	 i can forgive even that wrong of wrongs 
0	 those undreamt accidents that have made me 
0	 seeing that fame has perished this long while 
0	 being but a part of ancient ceremony 
0	 notorious till all my priceless things 
0	 are but a post the passing dogs defile 
0	i swayed upon the gaudy stern
0	the butt end of a steering oar 
0	and everywhere that i could turn
0	men ran upon the shore 
0	and though i would have hushed the crowd
0	there was no mother s son but said 
0	 what is the figure in a shroud
0	upon a gaudy bed 
0	and fishes bubbling to the brim
0	cried out upon that thing beneath 
0	 it had such dignity of limb 
0	by the sweet name of death 
0	though i d my finger on my lip 
0	what could i but take up the song 
0	and fish and crowd and gaudy ship
0	cried out the whole night long 
0	crying amid the glittering sea 
0	naming it with ecstatic breath 
0	because it had such dignity
0	by the sweet name of death 
0	if any man drew near
0	when i was young 
0	i thought he holds her dear 
0	and shook with hate and fear 
0	but oh twas bitter wrong
0	if he could pass her by
0	with an indifferent eye 
0	whereon i wrote and wrought 
0	and now being grey 
0	i dream that i have brought
0	to such a pitch my thought
0	that coming time can say 
0	 he shadowed in a glass
0	what thing her body was 
0	for she had fiery blood
0	when i was young 
0	and trod so sweetly proud
0	as twere upon a cloud 
0	a woman homer sung 
0	that life and letters seem
0	but an heroic dream 
0	i had this thought awhile ago 
0	 my darling cannot understand
0	what i have done or what would do
0	in this blind bitter land 
0	and i grew weary of the sun
0	until my thoughts cleared up again 
0	remembering that the best i have done
0	was done to make it plain 
0	that every year i have cried at length
0	my darling understands it all 
0	because i have come into my strength 
0	and words obey my call 
0	that had she done so who can say
0	what would have shaken from the sieve 
0	i might have thrown poor words away
0	and been content to live 
0	why should i blame her that she filled my days
0	with misery or that she would of late
0	have taught to ignorant men most violent ways 
0	or hurled the little streets upon the great 
0	had they but courage equal to desire 
0	what could have made her peaceful with a mind
0	that nobleness made simple as a fire 
0	with beauty like a tightened bow a kind
0	that is not natural in an age like this 
0	being high and solitary and most stern 
0	why what could she have done being what she is 
0	was there another troy for her to burn 
0	some may have blamed you that you took away
0	the verses that could move them on the day
0	when the ears being deafened the sight of the eyes blind
0	with lightning you went from me and i could find
0	nothing to make a song about but kings 
0	helmets and swords and half forgotten things
0	that were like memories of you but now
0	we ll out for the world lives as long ago 
0	and while we re in our laughing weeping fit 
0	hurl helmets crowns and swords into the pit 
0	but dear cling close to me since you were gone 
0	my barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone 
0	 would it were anything but merely voice 
0	the no king cried who after that was king 
0	because he had not heard of anything
0	that balanced with a word is more than noise 
0	yet old romance being kind let him prevail
0	somewhere or somehow that i have forgot 
0	though he d but cannon whereas we that had thought
0	to have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
0	have been defeated by that pledge you gave
0	in momentary anger long ago 
0	and i that have not your faith how shall i know
0	that in the blinding light beyond the grave
0	we ll find so good a thing as that we have lost 
0	the hourly kindness the day s common speech 
0	the habitual content of each with each
0	when neither soul nor body has been crossed 
0	ah that time could touch a form
0	that could show what homer s age
0	bred to be a hero s wage 
0	 were not all her life but storm 
0	would not painters paint a form
0	of such noble lines i said 
0	 such a delicate high head 
0	all that sternness amid charm 
0	all that sweetness amid strength 
0	ah but peace that comes at length 
0	came when time had touched her form 
0	o heart be at peace because
0	nor knave nor dolt can break
0	what s not for their applause 
0	being for a woman s sake 
0	enough if the work has seemed 
0	so did she your strength renew 
0	a dream that a lion had dreamed
0	till the wilderness cried aloud 
0	a secret between you two 
0	between the proud and the proud 
0	what still you would have their praise 
0	but here s a haughtier text 
0	the labyrinth of her days
0	that her own strangeness perplexed 
0	and how what her dreaming gave
0	earned slander ingratitude 
0	from self same dolt and knave 
0	aye and worse wrong than these 
0	yet she singing upon her road 
0	half lion half child is at peace 
0	the fascination of what s difficult
0	has dried the sap out of my veins and rent
0	spontaneous joy and natural content
0	out of my heart there s something ails our colt
0	that must as if it had not holy blood 
0	nor on an olympus leaped from cloud to cloud 
0	shiver under the lash strain sweat and jolt
0	as though it dragged road metal my curse on plays
0	that have to be set up in fifty ways 
0	on the day s war with every knave and dolt 
0	theatre business management of men 
0	i swear before the dawn comes round again
0	i ll find the stable and pull out the bolt 
0	wine comes in at the mouth
0	and love comes in at the eye 
0	that s all we shall know for truth
0	before we grow old and die 
0	i lift the glass to my mouth 
0	i look at you and i sigh 
0	though leaves are many the root is one 
0	through all the lying days of my youth
0	i swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun 
0	now i may wither into the truth 
0	where where but here have pride and truth 
0	that long to give themselves for wage 
0	to shake their wicked sides at youth
0	restraining reckless middle age 
0	you say as i have often given tongue
0	in praise of what another s said or sung 
0	 twere politic to do the like by these 
0	but have you known a dog to praise his fleas 
0	 put off that mask of burning gold
0	with emerald eyes 
0	 o no my dear you make so bold
0	to find if hearts be wild and wise 
0	and yet not cold 
0	 i would but find what s there to find 
0	love or deceit 
0	 it was the mask engaged your mind 
0	and after set your heart to beat 
0	not what s behind 
0	 but lest you are my enemy 
0	i must enquire 
0	 o no my dear let all that be 
0	what matter so there is but fire
0	in you in me 
0	how should the world be luckier if this house 
0	where passion and precision have been one
0	time out of mind became too ruinous
0	to breed the lidless eye that loves the sun 
0	and the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow
0	where wings have memory of wings and all
0	that comes of the best knit to the best although
0	mean roof trees were the sturdier for its fall 
0	how should their luck run high enough to reach
0	the gifts that govern men and after these
0	to gradual time s last gift a written speech
0	wrought of high laughter loveliness and ease 
0	 imitated from ronsard 
0	dear craoibhin aoibhin look into our case 
0	when we are high and airy hundreds say
0	that if we hold that flight they ll leave the place 
0	while those same hundreds mock another day
0	because we have made our art of common things 
0	so bitterly you d dream they longed to look
0	all their lives through into some drift of wings 
0	you ve dandled them and fed them from the book
0	and know them to the bone impart to us 
0	we ll keep the secret a new trick to please 
0	is there a bridle for this proteus
0	that turns and changes like his draughty seas 
0	or is there none most popular of men 
0	but when they mock us that we mock again 
0	these are the clouds about the fallen sun 
0	the majesty that shuts his burning eye 
0	the weak lay hand on what the strong has done 
0	till that be tumbled that was lifted high
0	and discord follow upon unison 
0	and all things at one common level lie 
0	and therefore friend if your great race were run
0	and these things came so much the more thereby
0	have you made greatness your companion 
0	although it be for children that you sigh 
0	these are the clouds about the fallen sun 
0	the majesty that shuts his burning eye 
0	there where the course is 
0	delight makes all of the one mind 
0	the riders upon the galloping horses 
0	the crowd that closes in behind 
0	we too had good attendance once 
0	hearers and hearteners of the work 
0	aye horsemen for companions 
0	before the merchant and the clerk
0	breathed on the world with timid breath 
0	sing on sometime and at some new moon 
0	we ll learn that sleeping is not death 
0	hearing the whole earth change its tune 
0	its flesh being wild and it again
0	crying aloud as the race course is 
0	and we find hearteners among men
0	that ride upon horses 
0	sickness brought me this
0	thought in that scale of his 
0	why should i be dismayed
0	though flame had burned the whole
0	world as it were a coal 
0	now i have seen it weighed
0	against a soul 
0	all things can tempt me from this craft of verse 
0	one time it was a woman s face or worse 
0	the seeming needs of my fool driven land 
0	now nothing but comes readier to the hand
0	than this accustomed toil when i was young 
0	i had not given a penny for a song
0	did not the poet sing it with such airs
0	that one believed he had a sword upstairs 
0	yet would be now could i but have my wish 
0	i whispered i am too young 
0	and then i am old enough 
0	wherefore i threw a penny
0	to find out if i might love 
0	 go and love go and love young man 
0	if the lady be young and fair 
0	ah penny brown penny brown penny 
0	i am looped in the loops of her hair 
0	oh love is the crooked thing 
0	there is nobody wise enough
0	to find out all that is in it 
0	for he would be thinking of love
0	till the stars had run away 
0	and the shadows eaten the moon 
0	ah penny brown penny brown penny 
0	one cannot begin it too soon 
0	bridget his wife 
0	teigue a fool 
0	he said we might choose the subject for the lesson 
0	there is none of us wise enough to do that 
0	i will question him 
0	give me a penny 
0	give me a penny 
0	 taking up book how heavy it is 
0	make him spread out his arms 
0	give me a penny 
0	is that the right cry for an eagle cock 
0	that s it and then he cannot blame us for the choice 
0	the master has come 
0	will anybody give a penny to a fool 
0	a bracket on the wall one pupil puts the book before him 
0	we have chosen the passage for the lesson master there are two
0	lambing time there 
0	i knew that it was folly but they would have it 
0	had we not better say we picked it by chance 
0	no he would say we were children still 
0	the beggar who wrote that on babylon wall meant that there is a
0	spiritual kingdom that cannot be seen or known till the faculties
0	let s come away and find a better subject 
0	and maybe now you ll let me choose 
0	were it but true twould alter everything
0	until the stream of the world had changed its course 
0	and that and all our thoughts had run
0	into some cloudy thunderous spring
0	they dream to be its source 
0	aye to some frenzy of the mind 
0	and all that we have done would be undone 
0	our speculation but as the wind 
0	i have dreamed it twice 
0	something has troubled him 
0	twice have i dreamed it in a morning dream 
0	now nothing serves my pupils but to come
0	with a like thought reason is growing dim 
0	a moment more and frenzy will beat his drum
0	and laugh aloud and scream 
0	and i must dance in the dream 
0	no no but it is like a hawk a hawk of the air 
0	it has swooped down and this swoop makes the third 
0	and what can i but tremble like a bird 
0	give me a penny 
0	won t you give me a penny 
0	such a great wise teacher will not refuse a penny to a fool 
0	o i know i know i know what i have seen 
0	that s foolish advice for a wise man to give 
0	what are the shears for 
0	i won t tell you if i told you you would drive them away 
0	drive them away who would i drive away 
0	i won t tell you 
0	not if i give you a penny 
0	not if i give you two pennies 
0	three pennies 
0	four and i will tell you 
0	a strange place that to fish in 
0	i have seen plenty of angels 
0	no no you have not 
0	i knew you would drive them away 
0	i had forgotten who i spoke to 
0	well there are your four pennies fool you are called 
0	and all day long they cry come hither fool 
0	or else it s fool be gone 
0	or fool stand there 
0	or fool go sit in the corner 
0	and all the while
0	what were they all but fools before i came 
0	what are they now but mirrors that seem men 
0	because of my image fool hold up your head 
0	what foolish stories they have told of the ghosts
0	that fumbled with the clothes upon the bed 
0	or creaked and shuffled in the corridor 
0	or else if they were pious bred 
0	of angels from the skies 
0	that coming through the door 
0	or it may be standing there 
0	would solidly out stare
0	the steadiest eyes with their unnatural eyes 
0	aye on a man s own floor 
0	man can be found with the right voice and may wear a
0	little golden domino and a halo made of metal or the
0	whole face may be a beautiful mask in which case the
0	last sentence on page should not be spoken 
0	yet it is strange the strangest thing i have known 
0	that i should still be haunted by the notion
0	that there s a crisis of the spirit wherein
0	we get new sight and that they know some trick
0	to turn our thoughts for their own ends to frenzy 
0	why do you put your finger to your lip 
0	and creep away 
0	 wise man sees angel what are you who are you 
0	i think i saw some like you in my dreams 
0	when but a child that thing about your head 
0	that brightness in your hair that flowery branch 
0	but i have done with dreams i have done with dreams 
0	i am the crafty one that you have called 
0	how that i called 
0	i am the messenger 
0	what message could you bring to one like me 
0	angel turning the hour glass 
0	that you will die when the last grain of sand
0	has fallen through this glass 
0	i have a wife 
0	children and pupils that i cannot leave 
0	why must i die my time is far away 
0	you have to die because no soul has passed
0	the heavenly threshold since you have opened school 
0	but grass grows there and rust upon the hinge 
0	and they are lonely that must keep the watch 
0	and whither shall i go when i am dead 
0	you have denied there is a purgatory 
0	therefore that gate is closed you have denied
0	there is a heaven and so that gate is closed 
0	where then for i have said there is no hell 
0	hell is the place of those who have denied 
0	they find there what they planted and what dug 
0	and wander there and drift and never cease
0	wailing for substance 
0	pardon me blessed angel 
0	i have denied and taught the like to others 
0	but how could i believe before my sight
0	had come to me 
0	it is too late for pardon 
0	had i but met your gaze as now i met it 
0	but how can you that live but where we go
0	in the uncertainty of dizzy dreams
0	know why we doubt parting sickness and death 
0	the rotting of the grass tempest and drouth 
0	these are the messengers that came to me 
0	why are you silent you carry in your hands
0	god s pardon and you will not give it me 
0	why are you silent were i not afraid 
0	i d kiss your hands no no the hem of your dress 
0	only when all the world has testified 
0	may soul confound it crying out in joy 
0	and laughing on its lonely precipice 
0	what s dearth and death and sickness to the soul
0	that knows no virtue but itself nor could it 
0	so trembling with delight and mother naked 
0	live unabashed if the arguing world stood by 
0	it is as hard for you to understand
0	why we have doubted as it is for us
0	to banish doubt what folly have i said 
0	there can be nothing that you do not know 
0	give me a year a month a week a day 
0	i would undo what i have done an hour 
0	give me until the sand has run in the glass 
0	though you may not undo what you have done 
0	i have this power if you but find one soul 
0	before the sands have fallen that still believes 
0	one fish to lie and spawn among the stones
0	till the great fisher s net is full again 
0	you may the purgatorial fire being passed 
0	spring to your peace 
0	 who stole your wits away
0	and where are they gone 
0	my pupils come 
0	before you have begun to climb the sky
0	i shall have found that soul they say they doubt 
0	but what their mothers dinned into their ears
0	cannot have been so lightly rooted up 
0	besides i can disprove what i once proved 
0	and yet give me some thought some argument 
0	more mighty than my own 
0	farewell farewell 
0	for i am weary of the weight of time 
0	some of his pupils come in at the other side of the stage 
0	master master you must choose the subject 
0	the pupils may have little cushions on which presently
0	they seat themselves 
0	here is a subject where have the fool s wits gone singing 
0	 who dragged your wits away
0	where no one knows 
0	or have they run off
0	on their own pair of shoes 
0	give me a penny 
0	the master will find your wits 
0	and when they are found you must not beg for pennies 
0	they are hidden somewhere in the badger s hole 
0	but you must carry an old candle end
0	if you would find them 
0	they are up above the clouds 
0	give me a penny give me a penny 
0	first pupil singing 
0	 i ll find your wits again 
0	come for i saw them roll 
0	to where old badger mumbles
0	in the black hole 
0	second pupil singing 
0	 no but an angel stole them
0	the night that you were born 
0	and now they are but a rag 
0	on the moon s horn 
0	be silent 
0	can you not see that he is troubled 
0	what do you think of when alone at night 
0	do not the things your mothers spoke about 
0	before they took the candle from the bedside 
0	rush up into the mind and master it 
0	till you believe in them against your will 
0	second pupil to first pupil 
0	you answer for us 
0	third pupil in a whisper to first pupil 
0	be careful what you say 
0	if he persuades you to an argument 
0	he will but turn us all to mockery 
0	we had no minds until you made them for us 
0	our bodies only were our mothers work 
0	you answer with incredible things it is certain
0	that there is one though it may be but one 
0	believes in god and in some heaven and hell 
0	in all those things we put into our prayers 
0	we thought those things before our minds were born 
0	but that was long ago we are not children 
0	you are afraid to tell me what you think
0	because i am hot and angry when i am crossed 
0	i do not blame you for it but have no fear 
0	for if there s one that sat on smiling there 
0	as though my arguments were sweet as milk
0	yet found them bitter i will thank him for it 
0	if he but speak his mind 
0	there is no one master 
0	there is not one but found them sweet as milk 
0	the things that have been told us in our childhood
0	are not so fragile 
0	we are no longer children 
0	we all believe in you and in what you have taught 
0	all all all all in you nothing but you 
0	i have deceived you where shall i go for words 
0	i have no thoughts my mind has been swept bare 
0	the messengers that stand in the fiery cloud 
0	fling themselves out if we but dare to question 
0	and after that the babylonian moon
0	blots all away 
0	first pupil to other pupils 
0	i take his words to mean
0	that visionaries and martyrs when they are raised
0	above translunary things and there enlightened 
0	as the contention is may lose the light 
0	and flounder in their speech when the eyes open 
0	how well he imitates their trick of speech 
0	their air of mystery 
0	their empty gaze 
0	as though they d looked upon some winged thing 
0	and would not condescend to mankind after 
0	master we have all learnt that truth is learnt
0	when the intellect s deliberate and cold 
0	as it were a polished mirror that reflects
0	an unchanged world and not when the steel melts 
0	bubbling and hissing till there s naught but fume 
0	when it is melted when it all fumes up 
0	they walk as when beside those three in the furnace
0	the form of the fourth 
0	master there s none among us
0	that has not heard your mockery of these 
0	or thoughts like these and we have not forgot 
0	something incredible has happened some one has come
0	suddenly like a grey hawk out of the air 
0	and all that i declared untrue is true 
0	first pupil to other pupils 
0	you d think the way he says it that he felt it 
0	there s not a mummer to compare with him 
0	he s something like a man 
0	give us some proof 
0	what proof have i to give but that an angel
0	an instant ago was standing on that spot 
0	you dreamed it 
0	i was awake as i am now 
0	first pupil to the others 
0	i may be dreaming now for all i know 
0	he wants to show we have no certain proof
0	of anything in the world 
0	there is this proof
0	that shows we are awake we have all one world
0	while every dreamer has a world of his own 
0	and sees what no one else can 
0	teigue sees angels 
0	so when the master says he has seen an angel 
0	he may have seen one 
0	both may still be dreamers 
0	unless it s proved the angels were alike 
0	what sort are the angels teigue 
0	that will prove nothing 
0	unless we are sure prolonged obedience
0	has made one angel like another angel
0	as they were eggs 
0	the master s silent now 
0	for he has found that to dispute with us 
0	seeing that he has taught us what we know 
0	is but to reason with himself let us away 
0	and find if there is one believer left 
0	yes yes find me but one that still believes
0	the things that we were told when we were children 
0	he ll mock and maul him 
0	from the first i knew
0	he wanted somebody to argue with 
0	i have no reason left all dark all dark 
0	here master is the very man you want 
0	he said when we were studying the book 
0	that maybe after all the monks were right 
0	and you mistaken and if we but gave him time 
0	he d prove that it was so 
0	i never said it 
0	dear friend dear friend do you believe in god 
0	master they have invented this to mock me 
0	you are afraid of me 
0	they know well master 
0	that all i said was but to make them argue 
0	they ve pushed me in to make a mock of me 
0	because they knew i could take either side
0	and beat them at it 
0	if you believe in god 
0	you are my soul s one friend 
0	mistress or wife
0	can give us but our good or evil luck
0	amid the howling world but you shall give
0	eternity and those sweet throated things
0	that drift above the moon 
0	how strange he is 
0	the angel that stood there upon that spot 
0	said that my soul was lost unless i found out
0	one that believed 
0	cease mocking at me master 
0	for i am certain that there is no god
0	nor immortality and they that said it
0	made a fantastic tale from a starved dream
0	to plague our hearts will that content you master 
0	the giddy glass is emptier every moment 
0	and you stand there debating laughing and wrangling 
0	out of my sight out of my sight i say 
0	i ll call my wife for what can women do 
0	that carry us in the darkness of their bodies 
0	but mock the reason that lets nothing grow
0	unless it grow in light bridget bridget 
0	a woman never ceases to believe 
0	say what we will bridget come quickly bridget 
0	from her arms which are covered with flour 
0	wife what do you believe in tell me the truth 
0	and not as is the habit with you all 
0	something you think will please me do you pray 
0	sometimes when you re alone in the house do you pray 
0	do you believe in god 
0	oh a good wife only believes in what her husband tells her 
0	but sometimes when the children are asleep
0	and i am in the school do you not think
0	about the martyrs and the saints and the angels 
0	and all the things that you believed in once 
0	my god my god i will go out myself 
0	my pupils said that they would find a man
0	whose faith i never shook they may have found him 
0	therefore i will go out but if i go 
0	the glass will let the sands run out unseen 
0	i cannot go i cannot leave the glass 
0	go call my pupils i can explain all now 
0	only when all our hold on life is troubled 
0	only in spiritual terror can the truth
0	come through the broken mind as the pease burst
0	out of a broken pease cod 
0	say to them 
0	that nature would lack all in her most need 
0	could not the soul find truth as in a flash 
0	upon the battle field or in the midst
0	of overwhelming waves and say to them 
0	but no they would but answer as i bid 
0	you want somebody to get up an argument with 
0	look out and see if there is any one
0	there in the street i cannot leave the glass 
0	for somebody might shake it and the sand
0	if it were shaken might run down on the instant 
0	go out and find if they have found a man
0	who did not understand me when i taught 
0	or did not listen 
0	strange that i should be blind to the great secret 
0	and that so simple a man might write it out
0	upon a blade of grass or bit of rush
0	with naught but berry juice and laugh to himself
0	writing it out because it was so simple 
0	then i am lost indeed 
0	children children 
0	your father wants you run to him 
0	come to me children do not be afraid 
0	i want to know if you believe in heaven 
0	god or the soul no do not tell me yet 
0	you need not be afraid i shall be angry 
0	say what you please so that it is your thought 
0	i wanted you to know before you spoke 
0	that i shall not be angry 
0	we have not forgotten father 
0	go to your mother go yet do not go 
0	and yet because the sands are running out 
0	i have but a moment to show it all in children 
0	the sap would die out of the blades of grass
0	had they a doubt they understand it all 
0	being the fingers of god s certainty 
0	yet can but make their sign into the air 
0	but could they find their tongues they d show it all 
0	but what am i to say that am but one 
0	when they are millions and they will not speak 
0	but they are gone what made them run away 
0	look at me tell me if my face is changed 
0	is there a notch of the fiend s nail upon it
0	already is it terrible to sight 
0	because the moment s near 
0	i dare not look 
0	i dare not know the moment when they come 
0	no no i dare not covers glass 
0	will there be a footfall 
0	or will there be a sort of rending sound 
0	or else a cracking as though an iron claw
0	had gripped the threshold stone 
0	what are you doing 
0	what are you doing that for 
0	i am blowing the dandelion to find out what hour it is 
0	you have heard everything and that is why
0	you d find what hour it is you d find that out 
0	that you may look upon a fleet of devils
0	dragging my soul away you shall not stop 
0	i will have no one here when they come in 
0	i will have no one sitting there no one 
0	and yet and yet there is something strange about you 
0	i half remember something what is it 
0	do you believe in god and in the soul 
0	tell me quickly 
0	speak speak for underneath the cover there
0	the sand is running from the upper glass 
0	and when the last grain s through i shall be lost 
0	there s but one pinch of sand and i am lost
0	if you are not he i seek 
0	o what a lot the fool knows but he says nothing 
0	yes i remember now you spoke of angels 
0	you said but now that you had seen an angel 
0	you are the one i seek and i am saved 
0	the last hope is gone 
0	and now that it s too late i see it all 
0	we perish into god and sink away
0	into reality the rest s a dream 
0	i know enough that know god s will prevails 
0	be silent may god s will prevail on the instant 
0	although his will be my eternal pain 
0	i have no question 
0	it is enough i know what fixed the station
0	of star and cloud 
0	and knowing all i cry
0	that what so god has willed
0	on the instant be fulfilled 
0	though that be my damnation 
0	the stream of the world has changed its course 
0	and with the stream my thoughts have run
0	into some cloudy thunderous spring
0	that is its mountain source 
0	aye to some frenzy of the mind 
0	for all that we have done s undone 
0	our speculation but as the wind 
0	 i hear the wind a blow
0	i hear the grass a grow 
0	and all that i know i know 
0	but i will not speak i will run away

0	near yonder copse where once the garden smil d

0	there where a few torn shrubs the place disclose 
0	the village preacher s modest mansion rose

0	thou canst not boast of fortune s store 
0	my love while me they wealthy call 
0	but i was glad to find thee poor 
0	for with my heart i d give thee all 
0	and then the grateful youth shall own 
0	i loved him for himself alone 
0	but when his worth my hand shall gain 
0	no word or look of mine shall show
0	that i the smallest thought retain

0	yet still his grateful heart shall own 
0	i loved him for himself alone 
0	my love still i think that i see her once more 
0	but alas she has left me her loss to deplore 
0	my own little kathleen my poor little kathleen 
0	her hair glossy black her eyes were dark blue 
0	her colour still changing her smiles ever new 
0	so pretty was kathleen my sweet little kathleen 
0	she milked the dun cow that ne er offered to stir 
0	though wicked to all it was gentle to her 
0	so kind was my kathleen my poor little kathleen 
0	she sat at the door one cold afternoon 
0	to hear the wind blow and to gaze on the moon 
0	so pensive was kathleen my poor little kathleen 
0	cold was the night breeze that sighed round her bower 
0	it chilled my poor kathleen she drooped from that hour 
0	and i lost my poor kathleen my own little kathleen 
0	the bird of all birds that i love the best 
0	is the robin that in the churchyard builds his nest 
0	for he seems to watch kathleen hops lightly o er kathleen 
0	the groves of blarney
0	they look so charming
0	down by the purling
0	of sweet silent brooks 
0	being banked with posies
0	that spontaneous grow there 
0	planted in order
0	by the sweet rock close 
0	 tis there s the daisy
0	and the sweet carnation 
0	the blooming pink 
0	and the rose so fair 
0	the daffydowndilly 
0	likewise the lily 
0	all flowers that scent
0	the sweet fragrant air 
0	that owns this station 
0	or queen helen fair 
0	there s no commander
0	in all the nation 
0	for emulation 
0	can with her compare 
0	such walls surround her
0	that no nine pounder
0	could dare to plunder
0	her place of strength 
0	her he did pommell 
0	and made a breach
0	in her battlement 
0	there s gravel walks there
0	for speculation
0	and conversation
0	in sweet solitude 
0	 tis there the lover
0	may hear the dove or
0	the gentle plover
0	in the afternoon 
0	and if a lady
0	would be so engaging
0	as to walk alone in
0	those shady bowers 
0	 tis there the courtier
0	he may transport her
0	into some fort or
0	all under ground 
0	for tis there s a cave where
0	no daylight enters 
0	but cats and badgers
0	are for ever bred 
0	being mossed by nature 
0	that makes it sweeter
0	than a coach and six or
0	a feather bed 
0	 tis there the lake is 
0	well stored with perches 
0	and comely eels in
0	the verdant mud 
0	beside the leeches 
0	and groves of beeches 
0	standing in order
0	for to guard the flood 
0	there s statues gracing
0	this noble place in 
0	all heathen gods
0	and nymphs so fair 
0	all standing naked
0	in the open air 
0	so now to finish
0	this brave narration 
0	which my poor genii
0	could not entwine 
0	but were i homer
0	 tis in every feature
0	i would make it shine 
0	oft in the stilly night 
0	ere slumber s chain has bound me 
0	fond memory brings the light
0	of other days around me 
0	the smiles the tears
0	of boyhood s years 
0	the words of love then spoken 
0	the eyes that shone
0	now dimm d and gone 
0	the cheerful homes now broken 
0	then in the stilly night 
0	ere slumber s chain hath bound me 
0	sad memory brings the light
0	of other days around me 
0	when i remember all
0	the friends so linked together
0	i ve seen around me fall
0	like leaves in wintry weather 
0	i feel like one
0	who treads alone
0	some banquet hall deserted 
0	whose lights are fled 
0	whose garlands dead 
0	and all but he departed 
0	then in the stilly night 
0	ere slumber s chain hath bound me 
0	sad memory brings the light
0	of other days around me 
0	at the mid hour of night when stars are weeping i fly
0	to the lone vale we loved when life shone warm in thine eye 
0	and i think oft if spirits can steal from the regions of air
0	to revisit past scenes of delight thou wilt come to me there 
0	and tell me our love is remembered even in the sky 
0	then i sing the wild song it once was rapture to hear
0	when our voices commingling breathed like one on the ear 
0	and as echo far off through the vale my sad orison rolls 
0	i think o my love tis thy voice from the kingdom of souls
0	faintly answering still the notes that once were so dear 
0	not a drum was heard not a funeral note 
0	as his corse to the rampart we hurried 
0	not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
0	o er the grave where our hero we buried 
0	we buried him darkly at dead of night 
0	the sods with our bayonets turning 
0	by the struggling moonbeam s misty light 
0	and the lantern dimly burning 
0	no useless coffin enclosed his breast 
0	not in sheet or in shroud we wound him 
0	but he lay like a warrior taking his rest 
0	with his martial cloak around him 
0	few and short were the prayers we said 
0	and we spoke not a word of sorrow 
0	but we steadfastly gazed on the face that was dead 
0	and we bitterly thought of the morrow 
0	we thought as we hollow d his narrow bed 
0	and smooth d down his lonely pillow 
0	that the foe and the stranger would tread o er his head 
0	and we far away on the billow 
0	lightly they ll talk of the spirit that s gone 
0	and o er his cold ashes upbraid him 
0	but little he ll reck if they let him sleep on
0	in the grave where a briton has laid him 
0	but half of our heavy task was done 
0	when the clock struck the hour for retiring 
0	and we heard the distant and random gun
0	that the foe was sullenly firing 
0	slowly and sadly we laid him down 
0	from the field of his fame fresh and gory 
0	we carved not a line and we raised not a stone 
0	but we left him alone in his glory 
0	how hard is my fortune 
0	and vain my repining 
0	the strong rope of fate
0	for this young neck is twining 
0	my strength is departed 
0	my cheek sunk and sallow 
0	while i languish in chains 
0	in the gaol of cluanmeala 
0	no boy in the village
0	was ever yet milder 
0	i d play with a child 
0	and my sport would be wilder 
0	i d dance without tiring
0	from morning till even 
0	and the goal ball i d strike
0	to the lightning of heaven 
0	at my bed foot decaying 
0	my hurlbat is lying 
0	through the boys of the village
0	my goal ball is flying 
0	my horse mong the neighbours
0	neglected may fallow 
0	while i pine in my chains 
0	in the gaol of cluanmeala 
0	next sunday the patron
0	at home will be keeping 
0	and the young active hurlers
0	the field will be sweeping 
0	with the dance of fair maidens
0	the evening they ll hallow 
0	while this heart once so gay 
0	shall be cold in cluanmeala 
0	o many a day have i made good ale in the glen 
0	that came not of stream or malt like the brewing of men 
0	my bed was the ground my roof the greenwood above 
0	and the wealth that i sought one far kind glance from my love 
0	alas on that night when the horses i drove from the field 
0	that i was not near from terror my angel to shield 
0	she stretched forth her arms her mantle she flung to the wind 
0	and swam o er loch lene her outlawed lover to find 
0	o would that a freezing sleet wing d tempest did sweep 
0	and i and my love were alone far off on the deep 
0	i d ask not a ship or a bark or pinnace to save 
0	with her hand round my waist i d fear not the wind or the wave 
0	 tis down by the lake where the wild tree fringes its sides 
0	the maid of my heart my fair one of heaven resides 
0	i think as at eve she wanders its mazes along 
0	the birds go to sleep by the sweet wild twist of her song 
0	no longer shines brightly 
0	the voice of her music
0	no longer is sprightly 
0	no more to her maidens
0	the light dance is dear 
0	since the death of our darling
0	scully thou false one 
0	you basely betrayed him 
0	in his strong hour of need 
0	when thy right hand should aid him 
0	he fed thee he clad thee 
0	you had all could delight thee 
0	you left him you sold him 
0	may heaven requite thee 
0	scully may all kinds
0	of evil attend thee 
0	on thy dark road of life
0	may no kind one befriend thee 
0	may fevers long burn thee 
0	and agues long freeze thee 
0	may the strong hand of god
0	in his red anger seize thee 
0	had he died calmly 
0	i would not deplore him 
0	or if the wild strife
0	of the sea war closed o er him 
0	but with ropes round his white limbs
0	through ocean to trail him 
0	like a fish after slaughter 
0	 tis therefore i wail him 
0	long may the curse
0	of his people pursue them 
0	scully that sold him 
0	and soldier that slew him 
0	one glimpse of heaven s light
0	may they see never 
0	may the hearthstone of hell
0	be their best bed for ever 
0	in the hole which the vile hands
0	of soldiers had made thee 
0	unhonour d unshrouded 
0	and headless they laid thee 
0	no sigh to regret thee 
0	no eye to rain o er thee 
0	no dirge to lament thee 
0	no friend to deplore thee 
0	dear head of my darling 
0	how gory and pale 
0	these aged eyes see thee 
0	high spiked on their gaol 
0	that cheek in the summer sun
0	ne er shall grow warm 
0	nor that eye e er catch light 
0	but the flash of the storm 
0	a curse blessed ocean 
0	is on thy green water 
0	from the haven of cork
0	to ivera of slaughter 
0	since thy billows were dyed
0	with the red wounds of fear
0	sweet in her green dell the flower of beauty slumbers 
0	lulled by the faint breezes sighing through her hair 
0	sleeps she and hears not the melancholy numbers
0	breathed to my sad lute mid the lonely air 
0	down from the high cliffs the rivulet is teeming
0	to wind round the willow banks that lure him from above 
0	o that in tears from my rocky prison streaming 
0	i too could glide to the bower of my love 
0	ah where the woodbines with sleepy arms have wound her 
0	opes she her eyelids at the dream of my lay 
0	listening like the dove while the fountains echo round her 
0	to her lost mate s call in the forests far away 
0	come then my bird for the peace thou ever bearest 
0	still heaven s messenger of comfort to me 
0	come this fond bosom o faithfulest and fairest
0	bleeds with its death wound its wound of love for thee 
0	when pat came over the hill 
0	his colleen fair to see 
0	his whistle low but shrill 
0	the signal was to be 
0	 mary the mother said 
0	 some one is whistling sure 
0	says mary tis only the wind
0	is whistling through the door 
0	 pat whistles a bit of a popular air 
0	 i ve lived a long time mary 
0	in this wide world my dear 
0	but a door to whistle like that 
0	i never yet did hear 
0	 but mother you know the fiddle
0	and the wind upon the strings
0	is playing the tune i think 
0	 mary i hear the pig 
0	unaisy in his mind 
0	 but mother you know they say
0	the pigs can see the wind 
0	 that s true enough in the day 
0	but i think you may remark 
0	that pigs no more nor we
0	can see anything in the dark 
0	 the dog is barking now 
0	the fiddle can t play the tune 
0	 but mother the dogs will bark
0	whenever they see the moon 
0	 but how could he see the moon 
0	when you know the dog is blind 
0	blind dogs won t bark at the moon 
0	nor fiddles be played by the wind 
0	 i m not such a fool as you think 
0	i know very well it is pat 
0	shut your mouth you whistlin thief 
0	and go along home out o that 
0	 and you be off to your bed 
0	don t play upon me your jeers 
0	for though i have lost my eyes 
0	i haven t lost my ears 
0	am i the slave they say 
0	soggarth aroon 
0	since you did show the way 
0	soggarth aroon 
0	 their slave no more to be 
0	while they would work with me
0	old ireland s slavery 
0	soggarth aroon 
0	why not her poorest man 
0	soggarth aroon 
0	try and do all he can 
0	soggarth aroon 
0	her commands to fulfil
0	of his own heart and will

0	thy noble brothers justly dear

0	could ill have borne 
0	if on the day of ballach boy
0	some arm had laid by foul surprise 
0	the chieftain low 
0	even our victorious shout of joy
0	would soon give place to rueful cries
0	and groans of woe 
0	if on the day the saxon host
0	were forced to fly a day so great
0	the chief had been untimely lost 
0	our conquering troops should moderate
0	their mirthful glee 
0	there would not lack on lifford s day 
0	from galway from the glens of boyle 
0	from limerick s towers 
0	a marshalled file a long array
0	of mourners to bedew the soil
0	with tears in showers 
0	if on the day a sterner fate
0	compelled his flight from athenree 
0	his blood had flowed 
0	what numbers all disconsolate 
0	would come unasked and share with thee
0	affliction s load 
0	if derry s crimson field had seen
0	his life blood offered up though twere
0	on victory s shrine 
0	a thousand cries would swell the keen 
0	a thousand voices of despair
0	would echo thine 
0	o had the fierce dalcassian swarm
0	that bloody night on fergus banks
0	but slain our chief 
0	when rose his camp in wild alarm 
0	how would the triumph of his ranks
0	be dashed with grief 
0	how would the troops of murbach mourn
0	if on the curlew mountains day 
0	which england rued 
0	some saxon hand had left them lorn 
0	by shedding there amid the fray 
0	their prince s blood 
0	red would have been our warriors eyes
0	had roderick found on sligo field
0	a gory grave 
0	no northern chief would soon arise 
0	so sage to guide so strong to shield 
0	so swift to save 
0	long would leith cuinn have wept if hugh
0	had met the death he oft had dealt
0	among the foe 
0	but had our roderick fallen too 
0	all erin must alas have felt
0	the deadly blow 
0	what do i say ah woe is me 
0	already we bewail in vain
0	their fatal fall 
0	and erin once the great and free 
0	now vainly mourns her breakless chain 
0	and iron thrall 
0	then daughter of o donnell dry
0	thine overflowing eyes and turn
0	thy heart aside 
0	for adam s race is born to die 
0	and sternly the sepulchral urn
0	mocks human pride 
0	look not nor sigh for earthly throne 
0	nor place thy trust in arm of clay 
0	but on thy knees
0	uplift thy soul to god alone 
0	for all things go their destined way
0	as he decrees 
0	embrace the faithful crucifix 
0	and seek the path of pain and prayer
0	thy saviour trod 
0	nor let thy spirit intermix
0	with earthly hope and worldly care
0	its groans to god 
0	and thou o mighty lord whose ways
0	are far above our feeble minds
0	to understand 
0	sustain us in these doleful days 
0	and render light the chain that binds
0	our fallen land 
0	look down upon our dreary state 
0	and through the ages that may still
0	roll sadly on 
0	watch thou o er hapless erin s fate 
0	and shield at least from darker ill
0	the blood of conn 
0	there was lifted up one voice of woe 
0	one lament of more than mortal grief 
0	through the wide south to and fro 
0	for a fallen chief 
0	in the dead of night that cry thrilled through me 
0	i looked out upon the midnight air 
0	mine own soul was all as gloomy 
0	and i knelt in prayer 
0	o er loch gur that night once twice yea thrice 
0	passed a wail of anguish for the brave 
0	that half curled into ice
0	the moon mirroring wave 
0	then uprose a many toned wild hymn in
0	choral swell from ogra s dark ravine 
0	and moguly s phantom women
0	far on carah mona s emerald plains 
0	shrieks and sighs were blended many hours 
0	and fermoy in fitful strains 
0	answered from her towers 
0	mourned in concert and their piercing keen 
0	woke to wondering life the stilly
0	from loughmoe to yellow dunanore
0	there was fear the traders of tralee
0	gathered up their golden store 
0	and prepared to flee 
0	for in ship and hall from night till morning
0	showed the first faint beamings of the sun 
0	all the foreigners heard the warning
0	 this they spake portendeth death to us 
0	if we fly not swiftly from our fate 
0	ravingly to prate 
0	not for base born higgling saxon trucksters
0	ring laments like those by shore and sea 
0	not for churls with souls of hucksters
0	for the high milesian race alone
0	ever flows the music of her woe 
0	for slain heir to bygone throne 
0	and for chief laid low 
0	hark again methinks i hear her weeping
0	yonder is she near me now as then 
0	or was but the night wind sweeping
0	down the hollow glen 
0	o woman of three cows agragh don t let your
0	tongue thus rattle 
0	o don t be saucy don t be stiff because you may
0	have cattle 
0	i have seen and here s my hand to you i only say
0	what s true 
0	a many a one with twice your stock not half so proud
0	as you 
0	good luck to you don t scorn the poor and don t be
0	their despiser 
0	for worldly wealth soon melts away and cheats the
0	very miser 
0	and death soon strips the proudest wreath from
0	haughty human brows 
0	then don t be stiff and don t be proud good woman
0	see where momonia s heroes lie proud owen more s
0	descendants 
0	 tis they that won the glorious name and had the
0	grand attendants 
0	if they were forced to bow to fate as every mortal
0	bows 
0	can you be proud can you be stiff my woman
0	the brave sons of the lord of clare they left the
0	land to mourning 
0	 mavrone for they were banished with no hope of
0	their returning 
0	who knows in what abodes of want those youths were
0	driven to house 
0	yet you can give yourself these airs o woman
0	o think of donnel of the ships the chief whom
0	nothing daunted 
0	see how he fell in distant spain unchronicled 
0	unchanted 
0	he sleeps the great o sullivan where thunder
0	cannot rouse 
0	then ask yourself should you be proud good woman
0	o ruark maguire those souls of fire whose names
0	are shrined in story 
0	think how their high achievements once made erin s
0	greatest glory 
0	yet now their bones lie mouldering under weeds and
0	cyprus boughs 
0	and so for all your pride will yours o woman
0	th o carrols also famed when fame was only for
0	the boldest 
0	rest in forgotten sepulchres with erin s best and
0	oldest 
0	yet who so great as they of yore in battle or
0	carouse 
0	just think of that and hide your head good woman
0	your neighbour s poor and you it seems are big
0	with vain ideas 
0	because inagh you ve got three cows one more i see 
0	than she has 
0	that tongue of yours wags more at times than
0	charity allows 
0	but if you re strong be merciful great woman
0	now there you go you still of course keep up
0	your scornful bearing 
0	and i m too poor to hinder you but by the cloak
0	i m wearing 
0	if i had but four cows myself even though you were
0	my spouse 
0	i d thwack you well to cure your pride my woman
0	i found in innisfail the fair 
0	in ireland while in exile there 
0	women of worth both grave and gay men 
0	many clerics and many laymen

0	and in every one of the five i found 
0	alike in church and in palace hall 
0	abundant apparel and food for all 
0	gold and silver i found and money 
0	plenty of wheat and plenty of honey 
0	i found god s people rich in pity

0	i found in each great church moreo er 
0	whether on island or on shore
0	piety learning fond affection 
0	holy welcome and kind protection 
0	i found thy good lay monks and brothers
0	ever beseeching help for others 
0	and in their keeping the holy word
0	pure as it came from jesus the lord 
0	i found in munster unfettered of any 
0	kings and queens and poets a many 
0	poets were skilled in music and measure 
0	prosperous doings mirth and pleasure 
0	i found in connaught the just redundance
0	of riches milk in lavish abundance

0	in cruachan s land of heroic name 
0	i found in the county of connall the glorious
0	bravest heroes ever victorious 
0	fair complexioned men and warlike 
0	ireland s lights the high the starlike 
0	i found in ulster from hill to glen 
0	hardy warriors resolute men 
0	beauty that bloomed when youth was gone 
0	and strength transmitted from sire to son 
0	i found in the noble district of boyle
0	brehons erenachs weapons bright 
0	and horsemen bold and sudden in fight

0	i found historians recording truth 
0	the things i sing of in verse unsmooth 
0	i found them all i have written sooth 
0	where is my chief my master this bleak night mavrone 
0	o cold cold miserably cold is this bleak night for hugh 
0	rolls real thunder or was that red livid light
0	only a meteor i scarce know but through the midnight dim
0	an awful a tremendous night is this meseems 
0	the flood gates of the river of heaven i think have been
0	burst wide 
0	though he were even a wolf ranging the round green woods 
0	though he were even a pleasant salmon in the unchainable sea 
0	though he were a wild mountain eagle he could scarce bear he 
0	this sharp sore sleet these howling floods 
0	o mournful is my soul this night for hugh maguire 
0	darkly as in a dream he strays before him and behind
0	triumphs the tyrannous anger of the wounding wind 
0	the wounding wind that burns as fire 
0	it is my bitter grief it cuts me to the heart 
0	that in the country of clan darry this should be his fate 
0	o woe is me where is he wandering houseless desolate 
0	alone without or guide or chart 
0	medreams i see just now his face the strawberry bright 
0	uplifted to the blackened heavens while the tempestuous winds
0	blow fiercely over and round him and the smiting
0	sleet shower blinds
0	the hero of galang to night 
0	large large affliction unto me and mine it is 
0	that one of his majestic bearing his fair stately form 
0	should thus be tortured and o erborne that this unsparing storm
0	should wreak its wrath on head like his 
0	that his great hand so oft the avenger of the oppressed 
0	he walks and wanders without rest 
0	the tempest driven torrent deluges the mead 
0	it overflows the low banks of the rivulets and ponds 
0	the lawns and pasture grounds lie locked in icy bonds
0	so that the cattle cannot feed 
0	the pale bright margins of the streams are seen by none 
0	rushes and sweeps along the untamable flood on every side 
0	it penetrates and fills the cottagers dwellings far and wide 
0	water and land are blent in one 
0	through some dark wood mid bones of monsters hugh now strays 
0	as he confronts the storm with anguished heart but manly brow 
0	o what a sword wound to that tender heart of his were now
0	a backward glance of peaceful days 
0	but other thoughts are his thoughts that can still inspire
0	with joy and onward bounding hope the bosom of mac nee 
0	thoughts of his warriors charging like bright billows the sea 
0	borne on the wind s wings flashing fire 
0	and though frost glaze to night the clear dew of his eyes 
0	and white ice gauntlets glove his noble fine fair fingers o er 
0	a warm dress is to him that lightning garb he ever wore 
0	the lightning of the soul not skies 
0	hugh marched forth to the fight i grieved to see him so depart 
0	roll forth my song like the rushing river 
0	that sweeps along to the mighty sea 
0	god will inspire me while i deliver
0	my soul to thee 
0	tell thou the world when my bones lie whitening
0	amid the last homes of youth and eld 
0	that there was once one whose blood ran lightning
0	no eye beheld 
0	tell how his boyhood was one drear night hour 
0	how shone for him through its griefs and gloom 
0	no star of all heaven sends to light our
0	path to the tomb 
0	roll on my song and to after ages
0	tell how disdaining all earth can give 
0	he would have taught men from wisdom s pages 
0	the way to live 
0	and tell how trampled derided hated 
0	and worn by weakness disease and wrong 
0	he fled for shelter to god who mated
0	his soul with song 
0	with song which alway sublime or vapid 
0	flowed like a rill in the morning beam 
0	perchance not deep but intense and rapid 
0	a mountain stream 
0	tell how this nameless condemned for years long
0	to herd with demons from hell beneath 
0	saw things that made him with groans and tears long
0	for even death 
0	go on to tell how with genius wasted 
0	betrayed in friendship befooled in love 
0	with spirit shipwrecked and young hopes blasted 
0	he still still strove 
0	till spent with toil dreeing death for others 
0	and some whose hands should have wrought for him 
0	 if children live not for sires and mothers 
0	his mind grew dim 
0	and he fell far through that pit abysmal
0	the gulf and grave of maginn and burns 
0	and pawned his soul for the devil s dismal
0	stock of returns 
0	but yet redeemed it in days of darkness 
0	and shapes and signs of the final wrath 
0	when death in hideous and ghastly starkness 
0	stood on his path 
0	and tell how now amid wreck and sorrow 
0	and want and sickness and houseless nights 
0	he bides in calmness the silent morrow 
0	that no ray lights 
0	and lives he still then yes old and hoary
0	at thirty nine from despair and woe 
0	he lives enduring what future story
0	will never know 
0	him grant a grave to ye pitying noble 
0	deep in your bosoms there let him dwell 
0	he too had tears for all souls in trouble 
0	here and in hell 
0	in siberia s wastes
0	the ice wind s breath
0	woundeth like the toothed steel 
0	lost siberia doth reveal
0	only blight and death 
0	blight and death alone 
0	no summer shines 
0	night is interblent with day 
0	in siberia s wastes alway
0	the blood blackens the heart pines 
0	in siberia s wastes
0	no tears are shed 
0	for they freeze within the brain 
0	nought is felt but dullest pain 
0	pain acute yet dead 
0	pain as in a dream 
0	when years go by
0	funeral paced yet fugitive 
0	when man lives and doth not live 
0	doth not live nor die 
0	in siberia s wastes
0	are sands and rocks 
0	nothing blooms of green or soft 
0	but the snowpeaks rise aloft
0	and the gaunt ice blocks 
0	and the exile there
0	is one with those 
0	they are part and he is part 
0	for the sands are in his heart 
0	and the killing snows 
0	therefore in those wastes
0	none curse the czar 
0	each man s tongue is cloven by
0	the north blast who heweth nigh
0	with sharp scymitar 
0	and such doom he drees 
0	till hunger gnawn 
0	and cold slain he at length sinks there 
0	yet scarce more a corpse than ere
0	his last breath was drawn 
0	on the ocean that hollows the rocks where ye dwell 
0	a shadowy land has appeared as they tell 
0	men thought it a region of sunshine and rest 
0	and they called it hy brasail the isle of the blest 
0	from year unto year on the ocean s blue rim 
0	the beautiful spectre showed lovely and dim 
0	the golden clouds curtained the deep where it lay 
0	and it looked like an eden away far away 
0	a peasant who heard of the wonderful tale 
0	in the breeze of the orient loosened his sail 
0	from ara the holy he turned to the west 
0	for though ara was holy hy brasail was blest 
0	he heard not the voices that called from the shore 
0	he heard not the rising wind s menacing roar 
0	home kindred and safety he left on that day 
0	and he sped to hy brasail away far away 
0	morn rose on the deep and that shadowy isle 
0	o er the faint rim of distance reflected its smile 
0	noon burned on the wave and that shadowy shore
0	seemed lovelily distant and faint as before 
0	lone evening came down on the wanderer s track 
0	and to ara again he looked timidly back 
0	o far on the verge of the ocean it lay 
0	yet the isle of the blest was away far away 
0	rash dreamer return o ye winds of the main 
0	bear him back to his own peaceful ara again 
0	bash fool for a vision of fanciful bliss
0	to barter thy calm life of labour and peace 
0	the warning of reason was spoken in vain 
0	he never re visited ara again 
0	night falls on the deep amidst tempest and spray 
0	and he died on the waters away far away 
0	my heart is far from liffey s tide
0	and dublin town 
0	it strays beyond the southern side
0	where capa chuinn hath woodlands green 
0	where amhan mhor s waters flow 
0	where dwell unsung unsought unseen
0	 mo craoibhin cno 
0	low clustering in her leafy screen 
0	 mo craoibhin cno 
0	the high bred dames of dublin town
0	are rich and fair 
0	with wavy plume and silken gown 
0	and stately air 
0	can plumes compare thy dark brown hair

0	or measur d pace thine artless grace 
0	 mo craoibhin cno 
0	when harebells scarcely show thy trace 
0	 mo craoibhin cno 
0	i ve heard the songs by liffey s wave
0	that maidens sung 
0	they sung their land the saxon s slave 
0	in saxon tongue 
0	o bring me here that gaelic dear
0	which cursed the saxon foe 
0	when thou didst charm my raptured ear 
0	 mo craoibhin cno 
0	and none but god s good angels near 
0	 mo craoibhin cno 
0	i ve wandered by the rolling lee 
0	and lene s green bowers 
0	i ve seen the shannon s wide spread sea
0	and limerick s towers 
0	and liffey s tide where halls of pride
0	frown o er the flood below 
0	my wild heart strays to amhan mhor s side 
0	 mo craoibhin cno 
0	with love and thee for aye to bide 
0	 mo craoibhin cno 
0	at the dance in the village thy white foot was fleetest 
0	thy voice in the concert of maidens was sweetest 
0	the swell of thy white breast made rich lovers follow 
0	and thy raven hair bound them young mairgread ni chealleadh 
0	thy neck was lost maid than the ceanabhan whiter 
0	and the glow of thy cheek than the monadan brighter 
0	but death s chain hath bound thee thine eye s glazed and hollow 
0	no more shall mine ear drink thy melody swelling 
0	nor thy beamy eye brighten the outlaw s dark dwelling 
0	or thy soft heaving bosom my destiny hallow 
0	when thine arms twine around me young mairgread ni chealleadh 
0	the moss couch i brought thee to day from the mountain 
0	has drank the last drop of thy young heart s red fountain 
0	for this good scian beside me stuck deep and run hollow
0	in thy bosom of treason young mairgread ni chealleadh 
0	with strings of rich pearls thy white neck was laden 
0	and thy fingers with spoils of the sassanach maiden 
0	such rich silks enrob d not the proud dames of mallow

0	alas that my loved one her outlaw would injure

0	i m sittin on the stile mary 
0	where we sat side by side 
0	on a bright may mornin long ago 
0	when first you were my bride 
0	the corn was springin fresh and green 
0	and the lark sang loud and high 
0	and the red was on your lip mary 
0	and the love light in your eye 
0	the place is little changed mary 
0	the day is bright as then 
0	the lark s loud song is in my ear 
0	and the corn is green again 
0	but i miss the soft clasp of your hand 
0	and your breath warm on my cheek 
0	and i still keep list nin for the words
0	you never more will speak 
0	 tis but a step down yonder lane 
0	and the little church stands near 
0	the church where we were wed mary 
0	i see the spire from here 
0	but the graveyard lies between mary 
0	and my step might break your rest 
0	for i ve laid you darling down to sleep 
0	with your baby on your breast 
0	i m very lonely now mary 
0	for the poor make no new friends 
0	but o they love the better still 
0	the few our father sends 
0	and you were all i had mary 
0	my blessin and my pride 
0	there s nothin left to care for now 
0	since my poor mary died 
0	yours was the good brave heart mary 
0	that still kept hoping on 
0	when the trust in god had left my soul 
0	and my arm s young strength was gone 
0	there was comfort even on your lip 
0	and the kind look on your brow 
0	i bless you mary for that same 
0	though you cannot hear me now 
0	i thank you for the patient smile
0	when your heart was fit to break 
0	when the hunger pain was gnawin there 
0	and you hid it for my sake 
0	i bless you for the pleasant word 
0	when your heart was sad and sore 
0	o i m thankful you are gone mary 
0	where grief can t reach you more 
0	i m biddin you a long farewell 
0	my mary kind and true 
0	but i ll not forget you darling 
0	in the land i m goin to 
0	they say there s bread and work for all 
0	and the sun shines always there 
0	but i ll not forget old ireland 
0	were it fifty times as fair 
0	and often in those grand old woods
0	i ll sit and shut my eyes 
0	and my heart will travel back again
0	to the place where mary lies 
0	and i ll think i see the little stile
0	where we sat side by side 
0	and the springin corn and the bright may morn 
0	when first you were my bride 
0	scorney bwee the barretts bailiff lewd and lame 
0	to lift the lynott s taxes when he came 
0	rudely drew a young maid to him 
0	then the lynotts rose and slew him 
0	and in tubber na scorney threw him 
0	small your blame 
0	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	then the barretts to the lynotts gave a choice 
0	saying hear ye murderous brood men and boys 
0	choose ye now without delay 
0	will ye lose your eyesight say 
0	or your manhoods here to day 
0	sad your choice 
0	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	then the little boys of the lynotts weeping said 
0	 only leave us our eyesight in our head 
0	but the bearded lynotts then
0	quickly answered back again 
0	 take our eyes but leave us men 
0	alive or dead 
0	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	so the barretts with sewing needles sharp and smooth 
0	let the light out of the eyes of every youth 
0	and of every bearded man 
0	of the broken lynott clan 
0	then their darkened faces wan
0	turning south
0	to the river 
0	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	o er the slippery stepping stones of clochan na n all
0	they drove them laughing loud at every fall 
0	as their wandering footsteps dark
0	failed to reach the slippery mark 
0	and the swift stream swallowed stark 
0	one and all
0	as they stumbled 
0	from the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	of all the blinded lynotts one alone
0	walk d erect from stepping stone to stone 
0	so back again they brought you 
0	and a second time they wrought you
0	with their needles but never got you
0	once to groan 
0	for the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	but with prompt projected footsteps sure as ever 
0	emon lynott again cross d the river 
0	though duvowen was rising fast 
0	and the shaking stones o ercast
0	by cold floods boiling past 
0	yet you never 
0	faltered once before your foemen of tirawley 
0	but turning on ballintubber bank you stood 
0	and the barretts thus bespoke o er the flood 
0	 o ye foolish sons of wattin 
0	small amends are these you ve gotten 
0	for while scorna boy lies rotten 
0	i am good
0	for vengeance 
0	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	 for tis neither in eye nor eyesight that a man
0	bears the fortunes of himself and his clan 
0	but in the manly mind 
0	these darken d orbs behind 
0	that your needles could never find
0	though they ran
0	through my heart strings 
0	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	 but little your women s needles do i reck 
0	for the night from heaven never fell so black 
0	but tirawley and abroad
0	from the moy to cuan an fod 
0	i could walk it every sod 
0	path and track 
0	ford and togher 
0	seeking vengeance on you barretts of tirawley 
0	 the night when dathy o dowda broke your camp 
0	what barrett among you was it held the lamp 
0	showed the way to those two feet 
0	when through wintry wind and sleet 
0	i guided your blind retreat
0	in the swamp
0	of beael an asa 
0	o ye vengeance destined ingrates of tirawley 
0	so leaving loud shriek echoing garranard 
0	the lynott like a red dog hunted hard 
0	with his wife and children seven 
0	 mong the beasts and fowls of heaven
0	in the hollows of glen nephin 
0	light debarred 
0	made his dwelling 
0	planning vengeance on the barretts of tirawley 
0	and ere the bright orb d year its course had run 
0	on his brown round knotted knee he nursed a son 
0	a child of light with eyes
0	as clear as are the skies
0	in summer when sunrise
0	has begun 
0	nursed his vengeance on the barretts of tirawley 
0	and as ever the bright boy grew in strength and size 
0	made him perfect in each manly exercise 
0	the salmon in the flood 
0	the dun deer in the wood 
0	the eagle in the cloud
0	to surprise
0	far above the foggy fields of tirawley 
0	with the yellow knotted spear shaft with the bow 
0	with the steel prompt to deal shot and blow 
0	he taught him from year to year
0	and train d him without a peer 
0	for a perfect cavalier 
0	hoping so 
0	far his forethought 
0	for vengeance on the barretts of tirawley 
0	and when mounted on his proud bounding steed 
0	emon oge sat a cavalier indeed 
0	like the ear upon the wheat
0	when winds in autumn beat
0	on the bending stems his seat 
0	and the speed
0	of his courser
0	was the wind from barna na gee o er tirawley 
0	now when fifteen sunny summers thus were spent 
0	 he perfected in all accomplishment 
0	the lynott said my child 
0	we are over long exiled
0	from mankind in this wild 
0	 time we went
0	through the mountain
0	to the countries lying over against tirawley 
0	so out over mountain moors and mosses brown 
0	and green steam gathering vales they journey d down 
0	till shining like a star 
0	through the dusky gleams afar 
0	the bailey of castlebar 
0	and the town
0	of macwilliam
0	rose bright before the wanderers of tirawley 
0	 look southward my boy and tell me as we go 
0	what see st thou by the loch head below 
0	 o a stone house strong and great 
0	and a horse host at the gate 
0	and a captain in armour of plate 
0	grand the show 
0	great the glancing 
0	high the heroes of this land below tirawley 
0	 and a beautiful bantierna by his side 
0	yellow gold on all her gown sleeves wide 
0	and in her hand a pearl
0	of a young little fair haired girl 
0	let us ride
0	to his presence 
0	and before him came the exiles of tirawley 
0	 god save thee macwilliam the lynott thus began 
0	 god save all here besides of this clan 
0	for gossips dear to me
0	are all in company 
0	for in these four bones ye see
0	a kindly man
0	 and hither as kindly gossip law allows 
0	i come to claim a scion of thy house
0	to foster for thy race 
0	since william conquer s days 
0	have ever been wont to place 
0	with some spouse
0	a macwilliam oge to foster in tirawley 
0	 and to show thee in what sort our youth are taught
0	i have hither to thy home of valour brought
0	this one son of my age 
0	for a sample and a pledge
0	for the equal tutelage 
0	in right thought 
0	word and action 
0	of whatever son ye give into tirawley 
0	when macwilliam beheld the brave boy ride and run 
0	saw the spear shaft from his white shoulder spun 
0	with a sigh and with a smile 
0	he said i would give the spoil
0	of a county that tibbot moyle 
0	my own son 
0	were accomplish d
0	like this branch of the kindly britons of tirawley 
0	when the lady macwilliam she heard him speak 
0	and saw the ruddy roses on his cheek 
0	she said i would give a purse
0	of red gold to the nurse
0	that would rear my tibbot no worse 
0	but i seek
0	hitherto vainly 
0	heaven grant that i now have found her in tirawley 
0	so they said to the lynott here take our bird 
0	and as pledge for the keeping of thy word 
0	let this scion here remain
0	till thou comest back again 
0	meanwhile the fitting train
0	of a lord
0	shall attend thee
0	with the lordly heir of connaught into tirawley 
0	so back to strong throng gathering garranard 
0	like a lord of the country with his guard 
0	came the lynott before them all 
0	once again over clochan na n all
0	steady and striding erect and tall 
0	and his ward
0	on his shoulders
0	to the wonder of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	then a diligent foster father you would deem
0	the lynott teaching tibbot by mead and stream 
0	to cast the spear to ride 
0	to stem the rushing tide 
0	with what feats of body beside 
0	might beseem
0	a macwilliam 
0	fostered free among the welshmen of tirawley 
0	but the lesson of hell he taught him in heart and mind 
0	for to what desire soever he inclined 
0	of anger lust or pride 
0	he had it gratified 
0	till he ranged the circle wide
0	of a blind
0	self indulgence 
0	ere he came to youthful manhood in tirawley 
0	then even as when a hunter slips a hound 
0	lynott loosed him god s leashes all unbound 
0	in the pride of power and station 
0	and the strength of youthful passion 
0	on the daughters of thy nation 
0	all around 
0	o the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	bitter grief and burning anger rage and shame 
0	filled the houses of the barretts where er he came 
0	till the young men of the back 
0	drew by night upon his track 
0	and slew him at cornassack 
0	small your blame 
0	sing the vengeance of the welshmen of tirawley 
0	said the lynott the day of my vengeance is drawing near 
0	the day for which through many a long dark year 
0	i have toiled through grief and sin 
0	and let the plea begin
0	over the bier
0	of macwilliam 
0	for an eric upon the barretts of tirawley 
0	then the brehons to macwilliam burke decreed
0	an eric upon clan barrett for the deed 
0	and the lynott s share of the fine 
0	as foster father was nine
0	ploughlands and nine score kine 
0	but no need
0	neither care for land or cattle in tirawley 
0	but rising while all sat silent on the spot 
0	he said the law says doth it not 
0	if the foster sire elect
0	his portion to reject 
0	he may then the right exact
0	to applot
0	the short eric 
0	 tis the law replied the brehons of tirawley 
0	said the lynott i once before had a choice
0	proposed me wherein law had little voice 
0	but now i choose and say 
0	as lawfully i may 
0	i applot the mulct to day 
0	so rejoice
0	in your ploughlands
0	and your cattle which i renounce throughout tirawley 
0	 and thus i applot the mulct i divide
0	the land throughout clan barrett on every side
0	equally that no place
0	may be without the face
0	of a foe of wattin s race 
0	that the pride
0	may be humbled hence for ever throughout tirawley 
0	 i adjudge a seat in every barrett s hall
0	to macwilliam in every stable i give a stall
0	to macwilliam and beside 
0	whenever a burke shall ride
0	through tirawley i provide
0	at his call
0	needful grooming 
0	without charge from any brughaidh of tirawley 
0	 thus lawfully i avenge me for the throes
0	ye lawlessly caused me and caused those
0	unhappy shame faced ones
0	who their mothers expected once 
0	would have been the sires of sons 
0	o er whose woes
0	often weeping 
0	i have groaned in my exile from tirawley 
0	 i demand not of you your manhoods but i take 
0	for the burkes will take it your freedom for the sake
0	of which all manhood s given
0	and all good under heaven 
0	and without which better even
0	you should make
0	yourselves barren 
0	than see your children slaves throughout tirawley 
0	 neither take i your eyesight from you as you took
0	mine and ours i would have you daily look
0	on one another s eyes
0	when the strangers tyrannize
0	by your hearths and blushes arise 
0	that ye brook
0	without vengeance
0	the insults of troops of tibbots throughout tirawley 
0	 the vengeance i designed now is done 
0	and the days of me and mine nearly run 
0	for for this i have broken faith 
0	teaching him who lies beneath
0	this pall to merit death 
0	and my son
0	to his father
0	stands pledged for other teaching in tirawley 
0	said macwilliam father and son hang them high 
0	and the lynott they hang d speedily 
0	but across the salt water 
0	to scotland with the daughter
0	of macwilliam well you got her 
0	did you fly
0	the gentlest of all the welshmen of tirawley 
0	 tis thus the ancient ollaves of erin tell
0	how through lewdness and revenge it befell
0	that the sons of william conquer
0	came over the sons of wattin 
0	throughout all the bounds and borders
0	of the lands of auley mac fiachra 
0	and his valiant bible guided 
0	free heretics of clan london
0	coming in in their succession 
0	rooted out both burke and barrett 
0	and in their empty places
0	new stems of freedom planted 
0	with many a goodly sapling
0	of manliness and virtue 
0	which while their children cherish 
0	may the mighty god of freedom
0	speed them well 
0	never taking
0	further vengeance on his people of tirawley 
0	they heaved the stone they heap d the cairn 
0	said ossian in a queenly grave
0	we leave her mong her fields of fern 
0	between the cliff and wave 
0	 the cliff behind stands clear and bare 
0	and bare above the heathery steep
0	scales the clear heaven s expanse to where
0	the danaan druids sleep 
0	 and all the sands that left and right 
0	the grassy isthmus ridge confine 
0	in yellow bars lie bare and bright
0	among the sparkling brine 
0	 a clear pure air pervades the scene 
0	in loneliness and awe secure 
0	meet spot to sepulchre a queen
0	who in her life was pure 
0	 here far from camp and chase removed 
0	apart in nature s quiet room 
0	the music that alive she loved
0	shall cheer her in the tomb 
0	 the humming of the noontide bees 
0	the lark s loud carol all day long 
0	and borne on evening s salted breeze 
0	the clanking sea bird s song 
0	 shall round her airy chamber float 
0	and with the whispering winds and streams

0	the tenor of her dreams 
0	 and oft at tranquil eve s decline 
0	when full tides lip the old green plain 
0	the lowing of moynalty s kine
0	shall round her breathe again 
0	 in sweet remembrance of the days
0	when duteous in the lowly vale 
0	unconscious of my oscar s gaze 
0	she fill d the fragrant pail 
0	 and duteous from the running brook
0	drew water for the bath nor deem d

0	bawn una bares her bosom s swell

0	i walked through ballinderry in the spring time 
0	when the bud was on the tree 
0	and i said in every fresh ploughed field beholding
0	the sowers striding free 
0	scattering broad cast forth the corn in golden plenty
0	on the quick seed clasping soil 
0	even such this day among the fresh stirred hearts of erin 
0	thomas davis is thy toil 
0	i sat by ballyshannon in the summer 
0	and saw the salmon leap 
0	and i said as i beheld the gallant creatures
0	spring glittering from the deep 
0	through the spray and through the prone heaps striving onward
0	to the calm clear streams above 
0	so seekest thou thy native founts of freedom thomas davis 
0	in thy brightness of strength and love 
0	i stood on derrybawn in the autumn 
0	i heard the eagle call 
0	with a clangorous cry of wrath and lamentation
0	that filled the wide mountain hall 
0	o er the bare deserted place of his plundered eyrie 
0	and i said as he screamed and soared 
0	so callest thou thou wrathful soaring thomas davis 
0	for a nation s rights restored 
0	and alas to think but now and thou art lying 
0	dear davis dead at thy mother s knee 
0	and i no mother near on my own sick bed 
0	i may lie and try to feel that i am not dreaming 
0	i may lie and try to say thy will be done 
0	but a hundred such as i will never comfort erin
0	for the loss of the noble son 
0	young husbandman of erin s fruitful seed time 
0	in the fresh track of danger s plough 
0	who will walk the heavy toilsome perilous furrow
0	girt with freedom s seed sheets now 
0	who will banish with the wholesome crop of knowledge
0	the flaunting weed and the bitter thorn 
0	now that thou thyself art but a seed for hopeful planting
0	against the resurrection morn 
0	young salmon of the flood time of freedom
0	that swells round erin s shore 
0	thou wilt leap against their loud oppressive torrent
0	of bigotry and hate no more 
0	drawn downward by their prone material instinct 
0	let them thunder on their rocks and foam 
0	thou hast leapt aspiring soul to founts beyond their raging 
0	where troubled waters never come 
0	but i grieve not eagle of the empty eyrie 
0	that thy wrathful cry is still 
0	and that the songs alone of peaceful mourners
0	are heard to day on erin s hill 
0	better far if brothers war be destined for us
0	 god avert that horrid day i pray 
0	that ere our hands be stained with slaughter fratricidal
0	thy warm heart should be cold in clay 
0	but my trust is strong in god who made us brothers 
0	that he will not suffer those right hands
0	which thou hast joined in holier rites than wedlock 
0	to draw opposing brands 
0	o many a tuneful tongue that thou madest vocal
0	would lie cold and silent then 
0	and songless long once more should often widowed erin
0	mourn the loss of her brave young men 
0	o brave young men my love my pride my promise 
0	 tis on you my hopes are set 
0	in manliness in kindliness in justice 
0	to make erin a nation yet 
0	self respecting self relying self advancing 
0	in union or in severance free and strong 
0	and if god grant this then under god to thomas davis
0	let the greater praise belong 
0	on the deck of patrick lynch s boat i sat in woful plight 
0	through my sighing all the weary day and weeping all the night 
0	were it not that full of sorrow from my people forth i go 
0	by the blessed sun tis royally i d sing thy praise mayo 
0	when i dwelt at home in plenty and my gold did much abound 
0	in the company of fair young maids the spanish ale went round 
0	they are altered girls in irrul now tis proud they re grown
0	and high 
0	with their hair bags and their top knots for i pass their
0	buckles by 
0	but it s little now i heed their airs for god will have it so 
0	that i must depart for foreign lands and leave my sweet mayo 
0	 tis my grief that patrick loughlin is not earl of irrul still 
0	and that brian duff no longer rules as lord upon the hill 
0	and that colonel hugh macgrady should be lying dead and low 
0	and i sailing sailing swiftly from the county of mayo 
0	 a girl s babble 
0	i go to knit two clans together 
0	our clan and this clan unseen of yore 
0	our clan fears nought but i go o whither 
0	this day i go from my mother s door 
0	thou red breast singest the old song over 
0	though many a time thou hast sung it before 
0	they never sent thee to some strange new lover 
0	i sing a new song by my mother s door 
0	i stepped from my little room down by the ladder 
0	the ladder that never so shook before 
0	i was sad last night to day i am sadder 
0	because i go from my mother s door 
0	the last snow melts upon bush and bramble 
0	the gold bars shine on the forest s floor 
0	shake not thou leaf it is i must tremble
0	because i go from my mother s door 
0	from a spanish sailor a dagger i bought me 
0	i trailed a rose tree our grey bawn o er 
0	the creed and my letters our old bard taught me 
0	my days were sweet by my mother s door 
0	my little white goat that with raised feet huggest
0	the oak stock thy horns in the ivies frore 
0	could i wrestle like thee how the wreaths thou tuggest 
0	i never would move from my mother s door 
0	o weep no longer my nurse and mother 
0	my foster sister weep not so sore 
0	you cannot come with me ir my brother 
0	alone i go from my mother s door 
0	farewell my wolf hound that slew macowing
0	as he caught me and far through the thickets bore 
0	my heifer alb in the green vale lowing 
0	my cygnet s nest upon lorna s shore 
0	he has killed ten chiefs this chief that plights me 
0	his hand is like that of the giant balor 
0	but i fear his kiss and his beard affrights me 
0	and the great stone dragon above his door 
0	had i daughters nine with me they should tarry 
0	they should sing old songs they should dance at my door 
0	they should grind at the quern no need to marry 
0	o when will this marriage day be o er 
0	had i buried like moirin three mates already 
0	i might say three husbands then why not four 
0	but my hand is cold and my foot unsteady 
0	because i never was married before 
0	the little black rose shall be red at last 
0	what made it black but the march wind dry 
0	and the tear of the widow that fell on it fast 
0	it shall redden the hills when june is nigh 
0	the silk of the kine shall rest at last 
0	what drove her forth but the dragon fly 
0	in the golden vale she shall feed full fast 
0	with her mild gold horn and her slow dark eye 
0	the wounded wood dove lies dead at last 
0	the pine long bleeding it shall not die 
0	this song is secret mine ear it passed
0	in a wind o er the plains at athenry 
0	she says poor friend you waste a treasure
0	which you can ne er regain 
0	time health and glory for the pleasure
0	of toying with a chain 
0	but then her voice so tender grows 
0	so kind and so caressing 
0	each murmur from her lips that flows
0	comes to me like a blessing 
0	sometimes she says sweet friend i grieve you 
0	alas it gives me pain 
0	what can i ah might i relieve you 
0	you ne er had mourned in vain 
0	and then her little hand she presses
0	upon her heart and sighs 
0	while tears whose source not yet she guesses 
0	grow larger in her eyes 
0	here i bide at the foot of the hill 
0	i am clansman to brian and servant to none 
0	whom i hated i hate whom i loved i love still 
0	blind am i on milk i live 
0	and meat god sends it on each saint s day 
0	though donald mac art may he never thrive 
0	last shrovetide drove half my kine away 
0	at the brown hill s base by the pale blue lake
0	i dwell and see the things i saw 
0	the heron flap heavily up from the brake 
0	the crow fly homeward with twig or straw
0	the wild duck a silver line in wake
0	cutting the calm mere to far bunaw 
0	and the things that i heard though deaf i hear 
0	from the tower in the island the feastful cheer 
0	the horn from the wood the plunge of the stag 
0	with the loud hounds after him down from the crag 
0	sweet is the chase but the battle is sweeter 
0	more healthy more joyous for true men meeter 
0	my hand is weak it once was strong 
0	my heart burns still with its ancient fire 
0	if any man smites me he does me wrong 
0	for i was the bard of brian mac guire 
0	if any man slay me not unaware 
0	by no chance blow nor in wine and revel 
0	i have stored beforehand a curse in my prayer
0	for his kith and kindred his deed is evil 
0	there never was king and never will be 
0	in battle or banquet like malachi 
0	the seers his reign had predicted long 
0	he honoured the bards and gave gold for song 
0	if rebels arose he put out their eyes 
0	if robbers plundered or burned the fanes 
0	he hung them in chaplets like rosaries 
0	that others beholding might take more pains 
0	there was none to women more reverent minded 
0	for he held his mother and mary dear 
0	if any man wronged them that man he blinded 
0	or straight amerced him of hand or ear 
0	there was none who founded more convents none 
0	in his palace the old and poor were fed 
0	the orphan might walk or the widow s son 
0	without groom or page to his throne or bed 
0	in his council he mused with great brows divine 
0	and eyes like the eyes of the musing kine 
0	upholding a sceptre o er which men said 
0	seven spirits of wisdom like fire tongues played 
0	he drained ten lakes and he built ten bridges 
0	he bought a gold book for a thousand cows 
0	he slew ten princes who brake their pledges 
0	with the bribed and the base he scorned to carouse 
0	he was sweet and awful through all his reign
0	god gave great harvests to vale and plain 
0	from his nurse s milk he was kind and brave 
0	and when he went down to his well wept grave 
0	through the triumph of penance his soul arose
0	to god and the saints not so his foes 
0	the king that came after ah woe woe woe 
0	he doubted his friend and he trusted his foe 
0	he bought and he sold his kingdom old
0	he pledged and pawned to avenge a spite 
0	no bard or prophet his birth foretold 
0	he was guarded and warded both day and night 
0	he counselled with fools and had boors at his feast 
0	he was cruel to christian and kind to beast 
0	men smiled when they talked of him far o er the wave 
0	well paid were the mourners that wept at his grave 
0	god plagued for his sake his people sore 
0	they sinned for the people should watch and pray 
0	that their prayers like angels at window and door 
0	may keep from the king the bad thought away 
0	the sun has risen on lip and brow 
0	he greets me i feel it with golden wand 
0	ah bright faced norna i see thee now 
0	where first i saw thee i see thee stand 
0	from the trellis the girl looked down on me 
0	her maidens stood near it was late in spring 
0	the grey priest laughed as she cried in glee 
0	 good bard a song in my honour sing 
0	i sang her praise in a loud voiced hymn 
0	to god who had fashioned her face and limb 
0	for the praise of the clan and the land s behoof 
0	so she flung me a flower from the trellis roof 
0	ere long i saw her the hill descending 
0	o er the lake the may morning rose moist and slow 
0	she prayed me her smile with the sweet voice blending 
0	to teach her all that a woman should know 
0	panting she stood she was out of breath 
0	the wave of her little breast was shaking 
0	from eyes still childish and dark as death 
0	came womanhood s dawn through a dew cloud breaking 
0	norna was never long time the same 
0	by a spirit so strong was her slight form moulded 
0	the curves swelled out from the flower like frame
0	in joy in grief to a bud she folded 
0	as she listened her eyes grew bright and large 
0	like springs rain fed that dilate their marge 
0	so i taught her the hymn of patrick the apostle 
0	and the marvels of bridget and columbkille 
0	ere long she sang like the lark or the throstle 
0	sang the deeds of the servants of god s high will 
0	i told her of brendan who found afar
0	another world neath the western star 
0	of our three great bishops in lindisfarne isle 
0	of st fursey the wondrous fiacre without guile 
0	of sedulius hymn maker when hymns were rare 
0	of scotus the subtle who clove a hair
0	into sixty parts and had marge to spare 
0	to her brother i spake of oisin and fionn 
0	and they wept at the death of great oisin s son 
0	i taught the heart of the boy to revel
0	in tales of old greatness that never tire 
0	and the virgin s up springing from earth s low level 
0	to wed with heaven like the altar fire 
0	i taught her all that a woman should know 
0	and that none should teach her worse lore i gave her
0	a dagger keen and taught her the blow
0	that subdues the knave to discreet behaviour 
0	a sand stone there on my knee she set 
0	and sharpened its point i can see her yet
0	i held back her hair and she sharpen d the edge 
0	while the wind piped low through the reeds and sedge 
0	she died in the convent on ina s height 
0	i saw her the day that she took the veil 
0	as slender she stood as the paschal light 
0	as tall and slender and bright and pale 
0	i saw her and dropped as dead bereaven
0	is earth when her holy ones leave her for heaven 
0	her brother fell in the fight at begh 
0	may they plead for me both on my dying day 
0	all praise to the man who brought us the faith 
0	 tis a staff by day and our pillow in death 
0	all praise i say to that blessed youth 
0	who heard in a dream from tyrawley s strand
0	that wail put forth o er the sea thy hand 
0	in the dark we die give us hope and truth 
0	but patrick built not on iorras shore
0	that convent where now the franciscans dwell 
0	columba was mighty in prayer and war 
0	but the young monk preaches as loud as his bell 
0	that love must rule all and all wrongs be forgiven 
0	or else he is sure we shall reach not heaven 
0	this doctrine i count right cruel and hard 
0	and when i am laid in the old churchyard 
0	the habit of francis i will not wear 
0	nor wear i his cord or his cloth of hair
0	in secret men dwindle till psalm and prayer
0	had softened the land no dane dwelt there 
0	i forgive old cathbar who sank my boat 
0	must i pardon feargal who slew my son 
0	or the pirate strongbow who burned granote 
0	they tell me and in it nine priests a nun 
0	and worse st finian s old crozier staff 
0	at forgiveness like that i spit and laugh 
0	my chief in his wine cups forgave twelve men 
0	and of these a dozen rebelled again 
0	there never was chief more brave than he 
0	the night he was born loch gar up burst 
0	he was bard loving gift making fond of glee 
0	the last to fly to advance the first 
0	he was like the top spray upon uladh s oak 
0	he was like the tap root of argial s pine 
0	he was secret and sudden as lightning his stroke 
0	there was none that could fathom his hid design 
0	he slept not if any man scorned his alliance
0	he struck the first blow for a frank defiance 
0	with that look in his face half night half light 
0	like the lake just blackened yet ridged with white 
0	there were comely wonders before he died 
0	the eagle barked and the banshee cried 
0	the witch elm wept with a blighted bud 
0	the spray of the torrent was red with blood 
0	the chief returned from the mountains bound 
0	forgot to ask after bran his hound 
0	we knew he would die three days were o er 
0	he died we waked him for three days more 
0	one by one upon brow and breast 
0	the whole clan kissed him in peace may he rest 
0	i sang his dirge i could sing that time
0	four thousand staves of ancestral rhyme 
0	to day i can scarcely sing the half 
0	of old i was corn and i now am chaff 
0	my song to day is a breeze that shakes
0	feebly the down on the cygnet s breast 
0	 twas then a billow the beach that rakes 
0	or a storm that buffets the mountain s crest 
0	whatever i bit with a venomed song 
0	grew sick were it beast or tree or man 
0	the wronged one sued me to right his wrong
0	with the flail of the satire and fierce ode s fan 
0	i sang to the chieftains each stock i traced 
0	lest lines should grow tangled through fraud or haste 
0	to princes i sang in a loftier tone
0	of moran the just who refused a throne 
0	of moran whose torque would close and choke
0	the wry necked witness that falsely spoke 
0	i taught them how to win love and hate 
0	not love from all and to shun debate 
0	to maids in the bower i sang of love 
0	and of war at the feastings in bawn or grove 
0	great is our order but greater far
0	were its pomp and power in the days of old 
0	when the five chief bards in peace or war
0	had thirty bards each in his train enrolled 
0	when ollave fodla in tara s hall
0	fed bards and kings when the boy king nial
0	was trained by torna when britain and gaul
0	sent crowns of laurel to dallan forgial 
0	to day we can launch the clans into fight 
0	that day we could freeze them in mid career 
0	whatever man knows was our realm by right 
0	the lore without music no gael would hear 
0	old cormac the brave blind king was bard
0	ere fame rose yet of o daly and ward 
0	the son of milesius was bard go back
0	my people he sang ye have done a wrong 
0	nine waves go back o er the green sea track 
0	let your foes their castles and coasts make strong 
0	to the island you came by stealth and at night 
0	she is ours if we win her in all men s sight 
0	for that first song s sake let our bards hold fast
0	to truth and justice from first to last 
0	 tis over some think we erred through pride 
0	though columba the vengeance turned aside 
0	too strong we were not too rich we were 
0	give wealth to knaves tis the true man s snare 
0	but now men lie they are just no more 
0	they forsake the old ways they quest for new 
0	they pry and they snuff after strange false lore 
0	as dogs hunt vermin it never was true 
0	i have scorned it for twenty years this babble 
0	that eastward and southward a saxon rabble
0	have won great battles and rule large lands 
0	and plight with daughters of ours their hands 
0	we know the bold norman o erset their throne
0	long since our lands let them guard their own 
0	how long he leaves me the great god here 
0	have i sinned some sin or has god forgotten 
0	this year i think is my hundredth year 
0	i am like a bad apple unripe and rotten 
0	they shall lift me ere long they shall lay me the clan 
0	by the strength of men on mount cruachan 
0	god has much to think of how much he hath seen 
0	and how much is gone by that once hath been 
0	on sandy hills where the rabbits burrow 
0	are raths of kings men named not now 
0	on mountain tops i have tracked the furrow 
0	and found in forests the buried plough 
0	for one now living the strong land then
0	gave kindly food and raiment to ten 
0	no doubt they waxed proud and their god defied 
0	so their harvest he blighted and burned their hoard 
0	or he sent them plagues or he sent the sword 
0	or he sent them lightning and so they died 
0	like dathi the king on the dark alp s side 
0	ah me that man who is made of dust 
0	should have pride towards god tis a demon s spleen 
0	i have often feared lest god the all just 
0	should bend from heaven and sweep earth clean 
0	should sweep us all into corners and holes 
0	like dust of the house floor both bodies and souls 
0	i have often feared he would send some wind
0	in wrath and the nation wake up stone blind 
0	in age or in youth we have all wrought ill 
0	i say not our great king nial did well 
0	where besides subduing this land of eire 
0	he raised in armorica banner and sign 
0	and wasted the british coast with fire 
0	perhaps in his mercy the lord will say 
0	 these men god s help twas a rough boy play 
0	he is certain that young franciscan priest 
0	god sees great sin where men see least 
0	yet this were to give unto god the eye 
0	unmeet the thought of the humming fly 
0	i trust there are small things he scorns to see
0	in the lowly who cry to him piteously 
0	our hope is christ i have wept full oft 
0	he came not to eire in oisin s time 
0	though love and those new monks would make men soft 
0	if they were not hardened by war and rhyme 
0	i have done my part my end draws nigh 
0	i shall leave old eire with a smile and sigh 
0	she will miss me not as i missed my son 
0	yet for her and her praise were my best deeds done 
0	man s deeds man s deeds they are shades that fleet 
0	or ripples like those that break at my feet 
0	the deeds of my chief and the deeds of my king
0	grow hazy far seen in the hills in spring 
0	nothing is great save the death on the cross 
0	but pilate and herod i hate and know
0	had fionn lived then he had laid them low 
0	though the world thereby had sustained great loss 
0	my blindness and deafness and aching back
0	with meekness i bear for that suffering s sake 
0	and the lent fast for mary s sake i love 
0	and the honour of him the man above 
0	my songs are all over now so best 
0	they are laid in the heavenly singer s breast 
0	who never sings but a star is born 
0	may we hear his song in the endless morn 
0	i give glory to god for our battles won
0	by wood or river on bay or creek 
0	for norna who died for my father conn 
0	for feasts and the chase on the mountains bleak 
0	i bewail my sins both unknown and known 
0	and of those i have injured forgiveness seek 
0	the men that were wicked to me and mine
0	 not quenching a wrong nor in war nor wine 
0	i forgive and absolve them all save three 
0	may christ in his mercy be kind to me 
0	 did they dare did they dare to slay eoghan ruadh o neill 
0	 yes they slew with poison him they feared to meet with steel 
0	 may god wither up their hearts may their blood cease to flow 
0	may they walk in living death who poisoned eoghan ruadh 
0	 though it break my heart to hear say again the bitter words 
0	 from derry against cromwell he marched to measure swords 
0	but the weapon of the sassanach met him on his way 
0	and he died at cloch uachtar upon st leonard s day 
0	 wail wail ye for the mighty one wail wail ye for the dead 
0	holy saviour but to think we shall never see him more 
0	 sagest in the council was he kindest in the hall 
0	sure we never won a battle twas owen won them all 
0	had he lived had he lived our dear country had been free 
0	but he s dead but he s dead and tis slaves we ll ever be 
0	audley and macmahon ye are valiant wise and true 
0	but what are ye all to our darling who is gone 
0	the rudder of our ship was he our castle s corner stone 
0	 wail wail him through the island weep weep for our pride 
0	would that on the battle field our gallant chief had died 
0	weep the victor of beinn burb weep him young and old 
0	weep for him ye women your beautiful lies cold 
0	 we thought you would not die we were sure you would not go 
0	and leave us in our utmost need to cromwell s cruel blow 
0	sheep without a shepherd when the snow shuts out the sky 
0	o why did you leave us eoghan why did you die 
0	 soft as woman s was your voice o neill bright was your eye 
0	o why did you leave us eoghan why did you die 
0	your troubles are all over you re at rest with god on high

0	o the marriage the marriage 
0	with love and mo bhuachaill for me

0	for eoghan is straight as a tower 
0	and tender and loving and true 
0	he told me more love in an hour
0	than the squires of the county could do 
0	then o the marriage etc 
0	his hair is a shower of soft gold 
0	his eye is as clear as the day 
0	his conscience and vote were unsold
0	when others were carried away 
0	his word is as good as an oath 
0	and freely twas given to me 
0	o sure twill be happy for both
0	the day of our marriage to see 
0	then o the marriage etc 
0	his kinsmen are honest and kind 
0	the neighbours think much of his skill 
0	and eoghan s the lad to my mind 
0	though he owns neither castle nor mill 
0	but he has a tilloch of land 
0	a horse and a stocking of coin 
0	a foot for a dance and a hand
0	in the cause of his country to join 
0	then o the marriage etc 
0	we meet in the market and fair 
0	we meet in the morning and night 
0	he sits on the half of my chair 
0	and my people are wild with delight 
0	yet i long through the winter to skim 
0	though eoghan longs more i can see 
0	when i will be married to him 
0	and he will be married to me 
0	then o the marriage the marriage 
0	with love and mo bhuachaill for me 
0	the ladies that ride in a carriage
0	might envy my marriage to me 
0	the summer brook flows in the bed 
0	the winter torrent tore asunder 
0	the skylark s gentle wings are spread
0	where walk the lightning and the thunder 
0	and thus you ll find the sternest soul
0	the gayest tenderness concealing 
0	and minds that seem to mock control 
0	are ordered by some fairy feeling 
0	then maiden start not from the hand
0	that s hardened by the swaying sabre 
0	the pulse beneath may be as bland
0	as evening after day of labour 
0	and maiden start not from the brow
0	that thought has knit and passion darkened 
0	in twilight hours neath forest bough 
0	the tenderest tales are often hearkened 
0	cold in the earth and the deep snow piled above thee 
0	far far removed cold in the dreary grave 
0	have i forgot my only love to love thee 
0	severed at last by time s all severing wave 
0	now when alone do my thoughts no longer hover
0	over the mountains on that northern shore 
0	resting their wings where heath and fern leaves cover
0	thy noble heart for ever ever more 
0	cold in the earth and fifteen wild decembers 
0	from these brown hills have melted into spring 
0	faithful indeed is the spirit that remembers
0	after such years of change and suffering 
0	sweet love of youth forgive if i forget thee 
0	while the world s tide is bearing me along 
0	other desires and other hopes beset me 
0	hopes which obscure but cannot do thee wrong 
0	no later light has lighted up my heaven 
0	no second morn has ever shone for me 
0	all my life s bliss from thy dear life was given 
0	all my life s bliss is in the grave with thee 
0	but when the days of golden dreams had perished 
0	and even despair was powerless to destroy 
0	then did i learn how existence could be cherished 
0	strengthened and fed without the aid of joy 
0	then did i check the tears of useless passion 
0	weaned my young soul from yearning after thine 
0	sternly denied its burning wish to hasten 
0	down to that tomb already more than mine 
0	and even yet i dare not let it languish 
0	dare not indulge in memory s rapturous pain 
0	once drinking deep of that divinest anguish
0	how could i seek the empty world again 
0	still let my tyrants know i am not doomed to wear
0	year after year in gloom and desolate despair 
0	a messenger of hope comes every night to me 
0	and offers for short life eternal liberty 
0	he comes with western winds with evening s wandering airs 
0	with that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars 
0	winds take a pensive tone and stars a tender fire 
0	and visions rise and change that kill me with desire 
0	desire for nothing known in my maturer years 
0	when joy grew mad with awe at counting future tears 
0	when if my spirit s sky was full of flashes warm 
0	i knew not whence they came from sun or thunderstorm 
0	but first a hush of peace a soundless calm descends 
0	the struggle of distress and fierce impatience ends 
0	mute music soothes my breast unuttered harmony
0	that i could never dream till earth was lost to me 
0	then dawns the invisible the unseen its truth reveals 
0	my outward sense is gone my inward essence feels 
0	its wings are almost free its home its harbour found 
0	measuring the gulf it stoops and dares the final bound 
0	o dreadful is the check intense the agony 
0	when the ear begins to hear and the eye begins to see 
0	when the pulse begins to throb the brain to think again 
0	the soul to feel the flesh and the flesh to feel the chain 
0	yet i would lose no sting would wish no torture less 
0	the more that anguish racks the earlier it will bless 
0	and robed in fires of hell or bright with heavenly shine 
0	if it but herald death the vision is divine 
0	no coward soul is mine 
0	no trembler in the world s storm troubled sphere 
0	i see heaven s glories shine 
0	and faith shines equal arming me from fear 
0	o god within my breast 
0	almighty ever present deity 
0	life that in me has rest 
0	as i undying life have power in thee 
0	vain are the thousand creeds
0	that move men s hearts unutterably vain 
0	worthless as withered weeds 
0	or idlest froth amid the boundless main 
0	to waken doubt in one
0	holding so fast to thine infinity 
0	so surely anchored on
0	the steadfast rock of immortality 
0	with wide embracing love
0	thy spirit animates eternal years 
0	pervades and broods above 
0	changes sustains dissolves creates and rears 
0	though earth and man were gone 
0	and suns and universes ceased to be 
0	and thou were left alone 
0	every existence would exist in thee 
0	there is not room for death 
0	nor atom that his might could render void 
0	and what thou art may never be destroyed 
0	who fears to speak of ninety eight 
0	who blushes at the name 
0	when cowards mock the patriot s fate 
0	who hangs his head for shame 
0	he s all a knave or half a slave
0	who slights his country thus 
0	but a true man like you man 
0	will fill your glass with us 
0	we drink the memory of the brave 
0	the faithful and the few 
0	some lie far off beyond the wave 
0	some sleep in ireland too

0	the fame of those who died 
0	all true men like you men 
0	remember them with pride 
0	some on the shores of distant lands
0	their weary hearts have laid 
0	and by the stranger s heedless hands
0	their lonely graves were made 
0	but though their clay be far away
0	beyond the atlantic foam 
0	in true men like you men 
0	their spirit s still at home 
0	the dust of some is irish earth 
0	among their own they rest 
0	and the same land that gave them birth
0	has caught them to her breast 
0	and we will pray that from their clay
0	full many a race may start
0	of true men like you men 
0	to act as brave a part 
0	they rose in dark and evil days
0	to right their native land 
0	they kindled here a living blaze
0	that nothing shall withstand 
0	alas that might can vanquish right 
0	 they fell and passed away 
0	but true men like you men 
0	are plenty here to day 
0	then here s their memory may it be
0	for us a guiding light 
0	to cheer our strife for liberty 
0	and teach us to unite 
0	through good and ill be ireland s still 
0	though sad as theirs your fate 
0	and true men be you men 
0	like those of ninety eight 
0	adieu to ballyshanny where i was bred and born 
0	go where i may i ll think of you as sure as night and morn 
0	the kindly spot the friendly town where every one is known 
0	and not a face in all the place but partly seems my own 
0	there s not a house or window there s not a field or hill 
0	but east or west in foreign lands i ll recollect them still 
0	i leave my warm heart with you tho my back i m forced to turn 
0	no more on pleasant evenings we ll saunter down the mall 
0	when the trout is rising to the fly the salmon to the fall 
0	the boat comes straining on her net and heavily she creeps 
0	till a silver wave of salmon rolls in among the crew 
0	the music of the waterfall the mirror of the tide 
0	when all the green hill d harbour is full from side to side 
0	from portnasun to bulliebawns and round the abbey bay 
0	from rocky inis saimer to coolnargit sandhills gray 
0	while far upon the southern line to guard it like a wall 
0	the leitrim mountains clothed in blue gaze calmly over all 
0	and watch the ship sail up or down the red flag at her stern 
0	adieu to these adieu to all the winding banks of erne 
0	farewell to you kildoney lads and them that pull an oar 
0	a lug sail set or haul a net from the point to mullaghmore 
0	from killybegs to bold slieve league that ocean mountain steep 
0	six hundred yards in air aloft six hundred in the deep 
0	from dooran to the fairy bridge and round by tullen strand 
0	adieu to all the billowy coast and winding banks of erne 
0	farewell coolmore bundoran and your summer crowds that run
0	from inland homes to see with joy th atlantic setting sun 
0	to breathe the buoyant salted air and sport among the waves 
0	to gather shells on sandy beach and tempt the gloomy caves 
0	the sick and old in search of health for all things have
0	their turn 
0	and i must quit my native shore and the winding banks of erne 
0	farewell to every white cascade from the harbour to belleek 
0	and every pool where fins may rest and ivy shaded creek 
0	the sloping fields the lofty rocks where ash and holly grow 
0	the one split yew tree gazing on the curving flood below 
0	the lough that winds through islands under turaw mountain green 
0	for i must say adieu adieu to the winding banks of erne 
0	the girls will bring their work and sing beneath a twisted thorn 
0	along the river side they go where i have often been 
0	o never shall i see again the days that i have seen 
0	a thousand chances are to one i never may return 
0	adieu to ballyshanny and the winding banks of erne 
0	adieu to evening dances when merry neighbours meet 
0	who trench d the rath on such a hill and where the bones may lie
0	and tender ditties sweetly sung to pass the twilight hour 
0	the mournful song of exile is now for me to learn 
0	adieu my dear companions on the winding banks of erne

0	round the abbey moy and knather i wish no one any hurt 
0	i hope that man and womankind will do the same by me 
0	for my heart is sore and heavy at voyaging the sea 
0	my loving friends i ll bear in mind and often fondly turn
0	to think of ballyshanny and the winding banks of erne 
0	if ever i m a money d man i mean please god to cast
0	my golden anchor in the place where youthful years were past 
0	though heads that now are black and brown must meanwhile
0	gather gray 
0	new faces rise by every hearth and old ones drop away 
0	yet dearer still that irish hill than all the world beside 
0	it s home sweet home where er i roam through lands and
0	waters wide 
0	and if the lord allows me i surely will return
0	to my native ballyshanny and the winding banks of erne

0	trooping all together 
0	green jacket red cap 
0	and white owl s feather 
0	down along the rocky shore
0	some make their home 
0	they live on crispy pancakes 
0	of yellow tide foam 
0	some in the reeds
0	of the bleak mountain lake 
0	with frogs for their watch dogs 
0	all night awake 
0	high on the hill top
0	the old king sits 
0	he is now so old and gray
0	he s nigh lost his wits 
0	with a bridge of white mist
0	columbkill he crosses 
0	on his stately journeys
0	or going up with music
0	on cold starry nights 
0	to sup with the queen
0	they stole little bridget
0	for seven years long 
0	when she came down again
0	her friends were all gone 
0	they took her lightly back 
0	between the night and morrow 
0	they thought that she was fast asleep 
0	but she was dead with sorrow 
0	they have kept her ever since
0	deep within the lake 
0	on a bed of flag leaves 
0	watching till she wake 
0	by the craggy hillside
0	through the mosses bare 
0	they have planted thorn trees
0	for pleasure here and there 
0	if any man so daring
0	as dig them up in spite 
0	he shall find their sharpest thorns
0	in his bed at night 
0	up the airy mountain 
0	down the rushy glen 
0	we daren t go a hunting
0	for fear of little men 
0	wee folk good folk 
0	trooping all together 
0	green jacket red cap 
0	and white owl s feather 
0	the abbot of inisfalen awoke ere dawn of day 
0	under the dewy green leaves went he forth to pray 
0	the lake around his island lay smooth and dark and deep 
0	and wrapped in a misty stillness the mountains were all asleep 
0	low kneel d the abbot cormac when the dawn was dim and gray 
0	the prayers of his holy office he faithfully gan say 
0	low kneel d the abbot cormac while the dawn was waxing red 
0	and for his sins forgiveness a solemn prayer he said 
0	low kneel d that holy abbot while the dawn was waking clear 
0	and he prayed with loving kindness for his convent brethren dear 
0	he pray d a prayer for all men he pray d it from his heart 
0	his blissful soul was in heaven tho a breathing man was he 
0	he was out of time s dominion so far as the living may be 
0	the abbot of inisfalen arose upon his feet 
0	he heard a small bird singing and o but it sung sweet 
0	it sung upon a holly bush this little snow white bird 
0	a song so full of gladness he never before had heard 
0	it sung upon a hazel it sung upon a thorn 
0	he had never heard such music since the hour that he was born 
0	it sung upon a sycamore it sung upon a briar 
0	to follow the song and hearken the abbot would never tire 
0	till at last he well bethought him he might no longer stay 
0	so he bless d the little white singing bird and gladly went
0	his way 
0	the strange men spoke unto him and he heard from all and each
0	the foreign tongue of the sassenach not wholesome irish speech 
0	then the oldest monk came forward in irish tongue spake he 
0	 thou wearest the holy augustine s dress and who hath given
0	it to thee 
0	 i wear the holy augustine s dress and cormac is my name 
0	the abbot of this good abbey by grace of god i am 
0	i went forth to pray at the dawn of day and when my prayers
0	were said 
0	i hearken d awhile to a little bird that sang above my head 
0	the monks to him made answer two hundred years have gone o er 
0	since our abbot cormac went through the gate and never was
0	heard of more 
0	matthias now is our abbot and twenty have pass d away 
0	the stranger is lord of ireland we live in an evil day 
0	days will come and go he said and the world will pass away 
0	in heaven a day is a thousand years a thousand years are a day 
0	 now give me absolution for my time is come said he 
0	and they gave him absolution as speedily as might be 
0	then close outside the window the sweetest song they heard
0	that ever yet since the world began was utter d by any bird 
0	the monks look d out and saw the bird its feathers all white
0	and clean 
0	and then in a moment beside it another white bird was seen 
0	those two they sang together waved their white wings and fled 
0	flew aloft and vanish d but the good old man was dead 
0	they buried his blessed body where lake and green sward meet 
0	a carven cross above his head a holly bush at his feet 
0	where spreads the beautiful water to gay or cloudy skies 
0	and the purple peaks of killarney from ancient woods arise 
0	now at the hour when ignorant mortals
0	drowse in the shade of their whirling sphere 
0	heaven and hell from invisible portals
0	breathing comfort and ghastly fear 
0	voices i hear 
0	i hear strange voices flitting calling 
0	wavering by on the dusky blast 
0	 come let us go for the night is falling 
0	come let us go for the day is past 
0	troops of joys are they now departed 
0	winged hopes that no longer stay 
0	guardian spirits grown weary hearted 
0	powers that have linger d their latest day 
0	what do they say 
0	what do they sing i hear them calling 
0	whispering gathering flying fast 
0	 come come for the night is falling 
0	come come for the day is past 
0	sing they to me thy taper s wasted 
0	mortal thy sands of life run low 
0	thine hours like a flock of birds have hasted

0	four ducks on a pond 
0	a grass bank beyond 
0	a blue sky of spring 
0	white clouds on the wing 
0	what a little thing
0	to remember for years 
0	to remember with tears 
0	within a budding grove 
0	in april s ear sang every bird his best 
0	but not a song to pleasure my unrest 
0	or touch the tears unwept of bitter love 
0	some spake methought with pity some as if in jest 
0	to every word
0	of every bird
0	i listen d or replied as it behove

0	the little fowl his utterance did repeat 
0	then i the man forlorn
0	hears earth send up a foolish noise aloft 
0	 and what ll he do what ll he do scoff d
0	the blackbird standing in ancient thorn 
0	then spread his sooty wings and flitted to the croft
0	with cackling laugh 
0	whom i being half
0	enraged called after giving back his scorn 
0	worse mock d the thrush die die 
0	o could he do it could he do it nay

0	which moved i wist not why me melancholy mad 
0	till now grown meek 
0	with wetted cheek 
0	most comforting and gentle thoughts i had 
0	long long ago beyond the misty space
0	of twice a thousand years 
0	in erin old there dwelt a mighty race
0	taller than roman spears 
0	like oaks and towers they had a giant grace 
0	were fleet as deers 
0	with winds and waves they made their biding place 
0	the western shepherd seers 
0	their ocean god was mananan mac lir 
0	whose angry lips
0	in their white foam full often would inter
0	whole fleets of ships 
0	 crom was their day god and their thunderer
0	made morning and eclipse 
0	 bride was their queen of song and unto her
0	they pray d with fire touch d lips 
0	great were their acts their passions and their sports 
0	with clay and stone
0	they piled on strath and shore those mystic forts 
0	not yet undone 
0	on cairn crown d hills they held their council courts 
0	while youths alone 
0	with giant dogs explored the elks resorts 
0	and brought them down 
0	of these was finn the father of the bard
0	whose ancient song
0	over the clamour of all change is heard 
0	sweet voiced and strong 
0	finn once o ertook granu the golden hair d 
0	the fleet and young

0	the primal poet sprung

0	by miscall d lake and desecrated grange
0	remains and shall remain 
0	the druid s altar and the druid s creed
0	we scarce can trace 
0	there is not left an undisputed deed

0	he stepped a man out on the ways of men 
0	and no one knew his sept or rank or name 
0	like a strong stream far issuing from a glen 
0	from some source unexplored the master came 
0	gossips there were who wondrous keen of ken 
0	surmised that he must be a child of shame 
0	others declared him of the druids then 
0	thro patrick s labours fallen from power and fame 
0	he lived apart wrapt up in many plans 
0	he wooed not women tasted not of wine 
0	he shunned the sports and councils of the clans 
0	nor ever knelt at a frequented shrine 
0	his orisons were old poetic ranns
0	which the new olamhs deem d an evil sign 
0	to most he seemed one of those pagan khans
0	whose mystic vigour knows no cold decline 
0	he was the builder of the wondrous towers 
0	which tall and straight and exquisitely round 
0	rise monumental round this isle of ours 
0	index like marking spots of holy ground 
0	in glooming silent glens in lowland bowers 
0	on river banks these cloichteachs old abound 
0	where art enraptured meditates long hours
0	and science ponders wondering and spell bound 
0	lo wheresoe er these pillar towers aspire 
0	heroes and holy men repose below 
0	the bones of some gleaned from a pagan pyre 
0	others in armour lie as for a foe 
0	it was the mighty master s life desire
0	to chronicle his great ancestors so 
0	what holier duty what achievement higher
0	remains to us than this he thus doth show 
0	yet he the builder died an unknown death 
0	his labours done no man beheld him more 
0	 twas thought his body faded like a breath 
0	or like a sea mist floated off life s shore 
0	doubt overhangs his fate and faith and birth 
0	his works alone attest his life and love 
0	they are the only witnesses he hath 
0	men called him gobban saor and many a tale
0	yet lingers in the byways of the land 
0	of how he cleft the rock and down the vale
0	led the bright river child like in his hand

0	 thomas d arcy mcgee 
0	my name is patrick sheehan 
0	my years are thirty four 
0	tipperary is my native place 
0	not far from galtymore 
0	i came of honest parents 
0	but now they re lying low 
0	and many a pleasant day i spent
0	my father died i closed his eyes
0	 outside our cabin door 
0	the landlord and the sheriff too
0	were there the day before 
0	and then my loving mother 
0	and sisters three also 
0	were forced to go with broken hearts
0	for three long months in search of work 
0	i wandered far and near 
0	i went then to the poor house 
0	for to see my mother dear 
0	the news i heard nigh broke my heart 
0	but still in all my woe 
0	i blessed the friends who made their graves
0	bereft of home and kith and kin 
0	with plenty all around 
0	i starved within my cabin 
0	and slept upon the ground 
0	but cruel as my lot was 
0	i ne er did hardship know
0	 till i joined the english army 
0	far away from aherlow 
0	 rouse up there says the corporal 
0	 you lazy hirish hound 
0	why don t you hear you sleepy dog 
0	the call to arms sound 
0	alas i had been dreaming
0	of days long long ago 
0	i woke before sebastopol 
0	i groped to find my musket 
0	how dark i thought the night 
0	o blessed god it was not dark 
0	it was the broad daylight 
0	and when i found that i was blind 
0	my tears began to flow 
0	i longed for even a pauper s grave
0	o blessed virgin mary 
0	mine is a mournful tale 
0	a poor blind prisoner here i am 
0	in dublin s dreary gaol 
0	struck blind within the trenches 
0	where i never feared the foe 
0	and now i ll never see again
0	my own sweet aherlow 
0	a poor neglected mendicant 
0	i wandered through the street 
0	my nine months pension now being out 
0	i beg from all i meet 
0	as i joined my country s tyrants 
0	my face i ll never show
0	among the kind old neighbours
0	then irish youths dear countrymen 
0	take heed of what i say 
0	for if you join the english ranks 
0	you ll surely rue the day 
0	and whenever you are tempted
0	a soldiering to go 
0	remember poor blind sheehan
0	she lived beside the anner 
0	at the foot of sliev na mon 
0	a gentle peasant girl 
0	with mild eyes like the dawn 
0	her lips were dewy rosebuds 
0	her teeth of pearls rare 
0	and a snow drift neath a beechen bough
0	her neck and nut brown hair 
0	how pleasant twas to meet her
0	on sunday when the bell
0	was filling with its mellow tones
0	lone wood and grassy dell 
0	and when at eve young maidens
0	strayed the river bank along 
0	the widow s brown haired daughter
0	was loveliest of the throng 
0	o brave brave irish girls 
0	we well may call you brave 
0	sure the least of all your perils
0	is the stormy ocean wave 
0	when you leave our quiet valleys 
0	and cross the atlantic s foam 
0	to hoard your hard won earnings
0	for the helpless ones at home 
0	 write word to my own dear mother 
0	say we ll meet with god above 
0	and tell my little brothers
0	i send them all my love 
0	may the angels ever guard them 
0	is their dying sister s prayer 
0	and folded in the letter
0	was a braid of nut brown hair 
0	ah cold and well nigh callous 
0	this weary heart has grown
0	for thy helpless fate dear ireland 
0	and for sorrows of my own 
0	yet a tear my eye will moisten
0	when by anner s side i stray 
0	for the lily of the mountain foot
0	that withered far away 
0	i sit beside my darling s grave 
0	who in the prison died 
0	and tho my tears fall thick and fast 
0	i think of him with pride 
0	ay softly fall my tears like dew 
0	for one to god and ireland true 
0	 i love my god o er all he said 
0	 and then i love my land 
0	and next i love my lily sweet 
0	who pledged me her white hand 
0	to each to all i m ever true 
0	to god to ireland and to you 
0	no tender nurse his hard bed smoothed
0	or softly raised his head 
0	he fell asleep and woke in heaven
0	ere i knew he was dead 
0	yet why should i my darling rue 
0	he was to god and ireland true 
0	o tis a glorious memory 
0	i m prouder than a queen
0	to sit beside my hero s grave
0	and think on what has been 
0	and o my darling i am true
0	to god to ireland and to you 
0	green in the wizard arms 
0	of the foam bearded atlantic 
0	an isle of old enchantment 
0	a melancholy isle 
0	enchanted and dreaming lies 
0	and there by shannon s flowing 
0	in the moonlight spectre thin 
0	the spectre erin sits 
0	an aged desolation
0	she sits by old shannon s flowing 
0	a mother of many children 
0	of children exiled and dead 
0	in her home with bent head homeless 
0	clasping her knees she sits 
0	keening keening 
0	and at her keene the fairy grass
0	trembles on dun and barrow 
0	around the foot of her ancient crosses
0	the grave grass shakes and the nettle swings 
0	in haunted glens the meadow sweet
0	flings to the night wind
0	her mystic mournful perfume 
0	the sad spearmint by holy wells
0	breathes melancholy balm 
0	sometimes she lifts her head 
0	with blue eyes tearless 
0	and gazes athwart the reek of night
0	upon things long past 
0	upon things to come 
0	and sometimes when the moon
0	brings tempest upon the deep 
0	and roused atlantic thunders from his caverns in the west 
0	the wolf hound at her feet
0	springs up with a mighty bay 
0	and chords of mystery sound from the wild harp at her side 
0	strung from the heart of poets 
0	and she flies on the verge of the tempest
0	around her shuddering isle 
0	with grey hair streaming 
0	a meteor of evil omen 
0	the spectre of hope forlorn 
0	keening keening 
0	she keenes and the strings of her wild harp shiver
0	on the gusts of night 
0	o er the four waters she keenes over moyle she keenes 
0	o er the sea of milith and the strait of strongbow 
0	chanting her song of destiny 
0	the rune of the weaving fates 
0	and the nations hear in the void and quaking time of night 
0	sad unto dawning dirges 
0	solemn dirges 
0	and snatches of bardic song 
0	their souls quake in the void and quaking time of night 
0	and they dream of the weird of kings 
0	and tyrannies moulting sick
0	in the dreadful wind of change 
0	wail no more lonely one mother of exiles wail no more

0	thy sorrows are the world s thou art no more alone

0	o er that sweet and silent glade in aghadoe 
0	there s a glen in aghadoe aghadoe aghadoe 
0	there s a deep and secret glen in aghadoe 
0	where i hid from the eyes of the red coats and their spies

0	on shaun dhuv my mother s son in aghadoe

0	for the treachery you did in aghadoe 
0	for they tracked me to that glen in aghadoe aghadoe 
0	when the price was on his head in aghadoe 
0	o er the mountain through the wood as i stole to him with food 
0	when in hiding lone he lay in aghadoe 
0	but they never took him living in aghadoe aghadoe 
0	with the bullets in his heart in aghadoe 
0	there he lay the head my breast keeps the warmth where
0	once twould rest 
0	gone to win the traitor s gold from aghadoe 
0	i walked to mallow town from aghadoe aghadoe 
0	brought his head from the gaol s gate to aghadoe 
0	then i covered him with fern and i piled on him the cairn 
0	like an irish king he sleeps in aghadoe 
0	o to creep into that cairn in aghadoe aghadoe 
0	there to rest upon his breast in aghadoe 
0	sure your dog for you could die with no truer heart than i 
0	your own love cold on your cairn in aghadoe

0	on this bosom strew
0	only flowers meek and pale 
0	and the yew 
0	lay these hands down by my side 
0	let my face be bare 
0	bind a kerchief round the face 
0	smooth my hair 
0	let my bier be borne at dawn 
0	summer grows so sweet 
0	deep into the forest green
0	where boughs meet 
0	then pass away and let me lie
0	one long warm sweet day
0	there alone with face upturned 
0	one sweet day 
0	while the morning light grows broad 
0	while noon sleepeth sound 
0	while the evening falls and faints 
0	while the world goes round 
0	i made another garden yea 
0	i left the dead rose where it lay
0	and set the new above 
0	why did my summer not begin 
0	why did my heart not haste 
0	my old love came and walked therein
0	and laid the garden waste 
0	she entered with her weary smile 
0	just as of old 
0	she looked around a little while
0	and shivered with the cold 
0	her passing touch was death to all 
0	her passing look a blight 
0	she made the white rose petals fall 
0	and turned the red rose white 
0	her pale robe clinging to the grass
0	seemed like a snake
0	that bit the grass and ground alas 
0	and a sad trail did make 
0	she went up slowly to the gate 
0	and then just as of yore 
0	she turned back at the last to wait
0	and say farewell once more

0	guess it rightly 
0	let it not go by thee 
0	there s a garden that i ken 
0	full of little gentlemen 
0	little caps of blue they wear 
0	and green ribbons very fair 
0	he comes to ye amidst the brine
0	the butterfly of the sun 
0	the man of the coat so blue and fine 
0	with red thread his shirt is done 
0	you see it come in on the shoulders of men 
0	like a thread of the silk it will leave us again 
0	a little lonely moorland lake 
0	its waters brown and cool and deep 
0	the cliff the hills behind it make
0	a picture for my heart to keep 
0	for rock and heather wave and strand 
0	wore tints i never saw them wear 
0	the june sunshine was o er the land 
0	before twas never half so fair 
0	the amber ripples sang all day 
0	and singing spilled their crowns of white
0	upon the beach in thin pale spray
0	that streaked the sober sand with light 
0	the amber ripples sang their song 
0	when suddenly from far o erhead
0	a lark s pure voice mixed with the throng
0	of lovely things about us spread 
0	some flowers were there so near the brink
0	their shadows in the waves were thrown 
0	while mosses green and gray and pink 
0	grew thickly round each smooth dark stone 
0	and over all the summer sky 
0	shut out the town we left behind 
0	 twas joy to stand in silence by 
0	one bright chain linking mind to mind 
0	o little lonely mountain spot 
0	your place within my heart will be
0	apart from all life s busy lot
0	a true sweet solemn memory 
0	out upon the sand dunes thrive the coarse long grasses 
0	herons standing knee deep in the brackish pool 
0	overhead the sunset fire and flame amasses 
0	and the moon to eastward rises pale and cool 
0	rose and green around her silver grey and pearly 
0	chequered with the black rooks flying home to bed 
0	for to wake at daybreak birds must couch them early 
0	and the day s a long one since the dawn was red 
0	on the chilly lakelet in that pleasant gloaming 
0	see the sad swans sailing they shall have no rest 
0	never a voice to greet them save the bittern s booming
0	where the ghostly sallows sway against the west 
0	 sister saith the grey swan sister i am weary 
0	turning to the white swan wet despairing eyes 
0	 o she saith my young one o she saith my dearie 
0	casts her wings about him with a storm of cries 
0	woe for lir s sweet children whom their vile step mother
0	glamoured with her witch spells for a thousand years 
0	died their father raving on his throne another 
0	blind before the end came from his burning tears 
0	she the fiends possess her torture her for ever 
0	gone is all the glory of the race of lir 
0	gone and long forgotten like a dream of fever 
0	but the swans remember all the days that were 
0	hugh the black and white swan with the beauteous feathers 
0	fiachra the black swan with the emerald breast 
0	conn the youngest dearest sheltered in all weathers 
0	him his snow white sister loves the tenderest 
0	these her mother gave her as she lay a dying 
0	to her faithful keeping faithful hath she been 
0	with her wings spread o er them when the tempest s crying 
0	and her songs so hopeful when the sky s serene 
0	other swans have nests made mid the reeds and rushes 
0	lined with downy feathers where the cygnets sleep
0	dreaming if a bird dreams till the daylight blushes 
0	then they sail out swiftly on the current deep 
0	with the proud swan father tall and strong and stately 
0	and the mild swan mother grave with household cares 
0	all well born and comely all rejoicing greatly 
0	full of honest pleasure is a life like theirs 
0	but alas for my swans with the human nature 
0	sick with human longings starved with human ties 
0	with their hearts all human cramped in a bird s stature 
0	and the human weeping in the bird s soft eyes 
0	never shall my swans build nests in some green river 
0	never fly to southward in the autumn grey 
0	rear no tender children love no mates for ever 
0	robbed alike of bird s joys and of man s are they 
0	babbled conn the youngest sister i remember
0	at my father s palace how i went in silk 
0	ate the juicy deer flesh roasted from the ember 
0	drank from golden goblets my child s draught of milk 
0	once i rode a hunting laughed to see the hurly 
0	shouted at the ball play on the lake did row 
0	you had for your beauty gauds that shone so rarely 
0	 peace saith finnuola that was long ago 
0	 sister saith fiachra well do i remember
0	how the flaming torches lit the banquet hall 
0	and the fire leaped skyward in the mid december 
0	and amid the rushes slept our staghounds tall 
0	by our father s right hand you sat shyly gazing 
0	smiling half and sighing with your eyes aglow 
0	as the bards sang loudly all your beauty praising 
0	 peace saith finnuola that was long ago 
0	 sister then saith hugh most do i remember
0	one i called my brother you earth s goodliest man 
0	strong as forest oaks are where the wild vines clamber 
0	first at feast or hunting in the battle s van 
0	angus you were handsome wise and true and tender 
0	loved by every comrade feared by every foe 
0	low low lies your beauty all forgot your splendour 
0	 peace saith finnuola that was long ago 
0	dews are in the clear air and the roselight paling 
0	over sands and sedges shines the evening star 
0	and the moon s disk high in heaven is sailing 
0	silvered all the spear heads of the rushes are 
0	housed warm are all things as the night grows colder 
0	water fowl and sky fowl dreamless in the nest 
0	but the swans go drifting drooping wings and shoulder 
0	cleaving the still waters where the fishes rest 
0	little sisters the birds 
0	we must praise god you and i 
0	you with songs that fill the sky 
0	i with halting words 
0	all things tell his praise 
0	woods and waters thereof sing 
0	summer winter autumn spring 
0	and the nights and days 
0	yea and cold and heat 
0	and the sun and stars and moon 
0	sea with her monotonous tune 
0	rain and hail and sleet 
0	and the winds of heaven 
0	and the solemn hills of blue 
0	and the brown earth and the dew 
0	and the thunder even 
0	and the flowers sweet breath 
0	all things make one glorious voice 
0	life with fleeting pains and joys
0	and our brother death 
0	little flowers of air 
0	with your feathers soft and sleek
0	and your bright brown eyes and meek 
0	he hath made you fair 
0	he hath taught to you
0	skill to weave on tree and thatch
0	nests where happy mothers hatch
0	speckled eggs of blue 
0	and hath children given 
0	when the soft heads overbrim
0	the brown nests then thank ye him

0	loveth you and thanketh you
0	for this courtesy 
0	sometimes when ye sing 
0	name my name that he may take
0	pity for the dear song s sake
0	on my shortcoming 
0	all in the april morning 
0	april airs were abroad 
0	the sheep with their little lambs
0	passed me by on the road 
0	the sheep with their little lambs
0	passed me by on the road 
0	all in the april evening 
0	i thought on the lamb of god 
0	the lambs were weary and crying
0	with a weak human cry 
0	i thought on the lamb of god
0	going meekly to die 
0	up in the blue blue mountains
0	dewy pastures are sweet 
0	rest for the little bodies 
0	rest for the little feet 
0	up on the hill top green 
0	only a cross of shame
0	two stark crosses between 
0	all in the april evening 
0	april airs were abroad 
0	i saw the sheep with their lambs 
0	and thought on the lamb of god 
0	here in the garden bed 
0	hoeing the celery 
0	wonders the lord has made
0	pass ever before me 
0	i saw the young birds build 
0	and swallows come and go 
0	and summer grow and gild 
0	and winter die in snow 
0	many a thing i note 
0	and store it in my mind 
0	for all my ragged coat 
0	that scarce will stop the wind 
0	i light my pipe and draw 
0	i marvel with much awe
0	o er all the lord hath made 
0	now here s a curious thing 
0	upon the first of march 
0	the crow goes house building 
0	in the elms and in the larch 
0	and be it shine or snow 
0	though many winds carouse 
0	that day the artful crow
0	begins to build his house 
0	but then the wonder s big 
0	 if sunday fall that day 
0	 nor straw nor scraw nor twig 
0	till monday will he lay 
0	his black wings to his side 
0	he ll drone upon his perch 
0	subdued and holy eyed 
0	as though he were at church 
0	the crow s a gentleman
0	not greatly to my mind 
0	he ll steal what seeds he can 
0	and all you hide he ll find 
0	yet though he s bully and sneak 
0	to small birds bird of prey 
0	he counts the days of the week 
0	and keeps the sabbath day 
0	rose o the world she came to my bed
0	and changed the dreams of my heart and head 
0	for joy of mine she left grief of hers
0	and garlanded me with a crown of furze 
0	rose o the world they go out and in 
0	and watch me dream and my mother spin 
0	and they pity the tears on my sleeping face
0	while my soul s away in a fairy place 
0	rose o the world they have words galore 
0	and wide s the swing of my mother s door 
0	but soft they speak of my darkened eyes 
0	but what do they know who are all so wise 
0	rose o the world the pain you give
0	is worth all days that a man may live 
0	worth all shy prayers that the colleens say
0	on the night that darkens the wedding day 
0	rose o the world what man would wed
0	when he might dream of your face instead 
0	might go to his grave with the blessed pain
0	of hungering after your face again 
0	rose o the world they may talk their fill 
0	for dreams are good and my life stands still
0	while their lives red ashes the gossips stir 
0	but my fiddle knows and i talk to her 
0	 tis i go fiddling fiddling 
0	by weedy ways forlorn 
0	i make the blackbird s music
0	ere in his breast tis born 
0	the sleeping larks i waken
0	twixt the midnight and the morn 
0	no man alive has seen me 
0	but women hear me play
0	sometimes at door or window 
0	fiddling the souls away 
0	the child s soul and the colleen s
0	out of the covering clay 
0	none of my fairy kinsmen
0	make music with me now 
0	alone the raths i wander
0	or ride the whitethorn bough 
0	but the wild swans they know me 
0	and the horse that draws the plough 
0	i said my pleasure shall not move 
0	it is not fixed in things apart 
0	seeking not love but yet to love 
0	i put my trust in mine own heart 
0	i knew the fountain of the deep
0	wells up with living joy unfed 
0	such joys the lonely heart may keep 
0	and love grow rich with love unwed 
0	still flows the ancient fount sublime 
0	but ah for my heart shed tears shed tears 
0	not it but love has scorn of time 
0	it turns to dust beneath the years 
0	we must pass like smoke or live within the spirit s fire 
0	for we can no more than smoke unto the flame return
0	if our thought has changed to dream our will unto desire 
0	as smoke we vanish though the fire may burn 
0	lights of infinite pity star the grey dusk of our days 
0	surely here is soul with it we have eternal breath 
0	in the fire of love we live or pass by many ways 
0	by unnumbered ways of dream to death 
0	its edges foamed with amethyst and rose 
0	withers once more the old blue flower of day 
0	there where the ether like a diamond glows
0	its petals fade away 
0	a shadowy tumult stirs the dusky air 
0	sparkle the delicate dews the distant snows 
0	the great deep thrills for through it everywhere
0	the breath of beauty blows 
0	i saw how all the trembling ages past 
0	moulded to her by deep and deeper breath 
0	neared to the hour when beauty breathes her last
0	and knows herself in death 
0	what of all the will to do 
0	it has vanished long ago 
0	for a dream shaft pierced it through
0	from the unknown archer s bow 
0	what of all the soul to think 
0	some one offered it a cup
0	filled with a diviner drink 
0	and the flame has burned it up 
0	what of all the hope to climb 
0	only in the self we grope
0	to the misty end of time 
0	truth has put an end to hope 
0	what of all the heart to love 
0	sadder than for will or soul 
0	no light lured it on above 
0	love has found itself the whole 
0	i did not deem it half so sweet
0	to feel thy gentle hand 
0	as in a dream thy soul to greet
0	across wide leagues of land 
0	untouched more near to draw to you
0	where amid radiant skies 
0	glimmered thy plumes of iris hue 
0	let me dream only with my heart 
0	love first and after see 
0	know thy diviner counterpart
0	before i kneel to thee 
0	so in thy motions all expressed
0	thy angel i may view 
0	i shall not in thy beauty rest 
0	but beauty s ray on you 
0	what is the love of shadowy lips
0	that know not what they seek or press 
0	from whom the lure for ever slips
0	and fails their phantom tenderness 
0	the mystery and light of eyes
0	that near to mine grow dim and cold 
0	they move afar in ancient skies
0	mid flame and mystic darkness rolled 
0	o beauty as thy heart o erflows
0	in tender yielding unto me 
0	a vast desire awakes and grows
0	unto forgetfulness of thee 
0	image of beauty when i gaze on thee 
0	trembling i waken to a mystery 
0	how through one door we go to life or death
0	by spirit kindled or the sensual breath 
0	image of beauty when my way i go 
0	no single joy or sorrow do i know 
0	elate for freedom leaps the starry power 
0	the life which passes mourns its wasted hour 
0	and ah to think how thin the veil that lies
0	between the pain of hell and paradise 
0	where the cool grass my aching head embowers
0	god sings the lovely carol of the flowers 
0	a cabin on the mountain side hid in a grassy nook 
0	with door and windows open wide where friendly stars may look 
0	the rabbit shy can patter in the winds may enter free
0	who throng around the mountain throne in living ecstasy 
0	and when the sun sets dimmed in eve and purple fills the air 
0	i think the sacred hazel tree is dropping berries there
0	from starry fruitage waved aloft where connla s well o erflows 
0	for sure the immortal waters run through every wind that blows 
0	i think when night towers up aloft and shakes the trembling dew 
0	how every high and lonely thought that thrills my spirit through
0	is but a shining berry dropped down through the purple air 
0	and from the magic tree of life the fruit falls everywhere 
0	no temple crowned the shaggy capes 
0	no safety soothed the kind 
0	the clouds unfabled shifted shapes 
0	and nameless roamed the wind 
0	the stars the circling heights of heaven 
0	the mountains bright with snows
0	looked down and sadly man at even
0	lay down and sad he rose 
0	till ages brought the hour again 
0	when fell a windless morn 
0	and child of agonistic pain
0	and bliss the word was born 
0	which grew from all it gazed upon 
0	and spread thro soil and sphere 
0	and shrunk the whole into the one 
0	and fetched the farthest here 
0	high is the summer s night but deep
0	the hidden mind unfolds 
0	within it does an image sleep
0	of all that it beholds 
0	alas when man with busy brow 
0	his conquering names hath set
0	to planet plant and worm who now
0	will teach us to forget 
0	what poet now when wisdoms fail 
0	another theme shall dare 
0	the nameless and remove the veil
0	which hides it everywhere 
0	what is that beyond thy life 
0	and beyond all life around 
0	which when thy quick brain is still 
0	nods to thee from the stars 
0	lo it says thou hast found
0	me the lonely lonely one 
0	think the ragged turf boy urges
0	o er the dusty road his asses 
0	think on sea shore far the lonely
0	heron wings along the sand 
0	think in woodland under oak boughs
0	now the streaming sunbeam passes 
0	and bethink thee thou art servant
0	to the same all moving hand 
0	ah see the fair chivalry come the companions of christ

0	the young with rapture gazed on thee and their hearts in
0	love were bound 
0	for thou wast brighter than the sun that sheds its light around 
0	my soul is dark o mary dear thy sun of beauty s set 
0	and i am left to pour my woe above thy grave alone 
0	for dear wert thou to the fond heart of morian shehone 
0	fast flowing tears above the grave of the rich man are shed 
0	but they are dried when the cold stone shuts in his narrow bed 
0	not so with my heart s faithful love the dark grave cannot hide
0	from morian s eyes thy form of grace of loveliness and pride 
0	thou didst not fall like the sere leaf when autumn s chill
0	winds blow 
0	 twas a tempest and a storm blast that has laid my mary low 
0	hadst thou not friends that loved thee well hadst thou not
0	garments rare 
0	wast thou not happy mary wast thou not young and fair 
0	o am i left to pour my woes above thy grave alone 
0	thou idol of the faithful heart of morian shehone 
0	sweet were thy looks and sweet thy smiles and kind wast thou
0	to all 
0	the withering scowl of envy on thy fortunes dared not fall 
0	for thee thy friends lament and mourn and never cease to weep 
0	o that their lamentations could awake thee from thy sleep 
0	o that thy peerless form again could meet my loving clasp 
0	o that the cold damp hand of death could loose his iron grasp 
0	yet when the valley s daughters meet beneath the tall elm tree 
0	and talk of mary as a dream that never more shall be 
0	then may thy spirit float around like music in the air 
0	and pour upon their virgin souls a blessing and a prayer 
0	o am i left to pour my wail above thy grave alone

0	which the wind makes over the sepulchre s stone 
0	 o why did she die our hearts blood had bought her 
0	o why did she die the geraldine s daughter 
0	the thistle beard floats the wild roses wave
0	with the blast that sweeps over the newly made grave 
0	the stars dimly twinkle and hoarse falls the water 
0	while night birds are wailing the geraldine s daughter

0	and when white moths were on the wing 
0	and moth like stars were flickering out 
0	i dropped the berry in a stream
0	and caught a little silver trout 
0	when i had laid it on the floor
0	i went to blow the fire a flame 
0	but something rustled on the floor 
0	and someone called me by my name 
0	it had become a glimmering girl
0	with apple blossom in her hair
0	who called me by my name and ran
0	and faded through the brightening air 
0	though i am old with wandering
0	through hollow lands and hilly lands 
0	i will find out where she has gone 
0	and kiss her lips and take her hands 
0	and walk among long dappled grass 
0	and pluck till time and times are done 
0	the silver apples of the moon 
0	the golden apples of the sun 
0	i rise in the dawn and i kneel and blow
0	till the seed of the fire flicker and glow 
0	and then i must scrub and bake and sweep
0	till stars are beginning to blink and peep 
0	and the young lie long and dream in their bed
0	of the matching of ribbons for bosom and head 
0	and their day goes over in idleness 
0	and they sigh if the wind but lift a tress 
0	while i must work because i am old 
0	and the seed of the fire gets feeble and cold 
0	when i play on my fiddle in dooney 
0	folk dance like a wave of the sea 
0	my cousin is priest in kilvarnet 
0	my brother in moharabuiee 
0	i passed my brother and cousin 
0	the host is riding from knocknarea
0	they read in their books of prayer 
0	i read in my book of songs
0	i bought at the sligo fair 
0	when we come at the end of time 
0	to peter sitting in state 
0	he will smile on the three old spirits 
0	but call me first through the gate 
0	for the good are always the merry 
0	save by an evil chance 
0	and the merry love the fiddle
0	and the merry love to dance 
0	and when the folk there spy me 
0	they will all come up to me 
0	with here is the fiddler of dooney 
0	and dance like a wave of the sea 
0	o what to me the little room
0	that was brimmed up with prayer and rest 
0	he bade me out into the gloom 
0	and my breast lies upon his breast 
0	o what to me my mother s care 
0	the house where i was safe and warm 
0	the shadowy blossom of my hair
0	will hide us from the bitter storm 
0	o hiding hair and dewy eyes 
0	i am no more with life and death 
0	my heart upon his warm heart lies 
0	my breath is mixed into his breath 
0	pale brows still hands and dim hair 
0	i had a beautiful friend
0	and dreamed that the old despair
0	would end in love in the end 
0	she looked in my heart one day
0	and saw your image was there 
0	she has gone weeping away 
0	do you not hear me calling white deer with no horns 
0	i have been changed to a hound with one red ear 
0	i have been in the path of stones and the wood of thorns 
0	for somebody hid hatred and hope and desire and fear
0	under my feet that they follow you night and day 
0	a man with a hazel wand came without sound 
0	he changed me suddenly i was looking another way 
0	and now my calling is but the calling of a hound 
0	and time and birth and change are hurrying by 
0	i would that the boar without bristles had come from the west
0	and had rooted the sun and moon and stars out of the sky
0	and lay in the darkness grunting and turning to his rest 
0	i hear the shadowy horses their long manes a shake 
0	their hoofs heavy with tumult their eyes glimmering white 
0	the north unfolds above them clinging creeping night 
0	the east her hidden joy before the morning break 
0	the west weeps in pale dew and sighs passing away 
0	the south is pouring down roses of crimson fire 
0	o vanity of sleep hope dream endless desire 
0	the horses of disaster plunge in the heavy clay 
0	beloved let your eyes half close and your heart beat
0	over my heart and your hair fall over my breast 
0	drowning love s lonely hour in deep twilight of rest 
0	and hiding their tossing manes and their tumultuous feet 
0	o curlew cry no more in the air 
0	or only to the waters in the west 
0	because your crying brings to my mind
0	passion dimmed eyes and long heavy hair
0	that was shaken out over my breast 
0	there is enough evil in the crying of wind 
0	when my arms wrap you round i press
0	my heart upon the loveliness
0	that has long faded from the world 
0	in shadowy pools when armies fled 
0	the love tales wove with silken thread
0	by dreaming ladies upon cloth
0	that has made fat the murderous moth 
0	the roses that of old time were
0	woven by ladies in their hair 
0	the dew cold lilies ladies bore
0	through many a sacred corridor
0	where such gray clouds of incense rose
0	that only the gods eyes did not close 
0	for that pale breast and lingering hand
0	come from a more dream heavy land 
0	a more dream heavy hour than this 
0	and when you sigh from kiss to kiss
0	i hear white beauty sighing too 
0	for hours when all must fade like dew
0	but flame on flame deep under deep 
0	throne over throne where in half sleep
0	their swords upon their iron knees
0	brood her high lonely mysteries 
0	i bring you with reverent hands
0	the books of my numberless dreams 
0	white woman that passion has worn
0	as the tide wears the dove gray sands 
0	and with heart more old than the horn
0	that is brimmed from the pale fire of time 
0	white woman with numberless dreams
0	i bring you my passionate rhyme 
0	fasten your hair with a golden pin 
0	and bind up every wandering tress 
0	i bade my heart build these poor rhymes 
0	it worked at them day out day in 
0	building a sorrowful loveliness
0	out of the battles of old times 
0	you need but lift a pearl pale hand 
0	and bind up your long hair and sigh 
0	and all men s hearts must burn and beat 
0	and candle like foam on the dim sand 
0	and stars climbing the dew dropping sky 
0	live but to light your passing feet 
0	be you still be you still trembling heart 
0	remember the wisdom out of the old days 
0	 him who trembles before the flame and the flood 
0	and the winds that blow through the starry ways 
0	let the starry winds and the flame and the flood
0	cover over and hide for he has no part
0	with the proud majestical multitude 
0	the jester walked in the garden 
0	the garden had fallen still 
0	he bade his soul rise upward
0	and stand on her window sill 
0	it rose in a straight blue garment 
0	when owls began to call 
0	it had grown wise tongued by thinking
0	of a quiet and light footfall 
0	but the young queen would not listen 
0	she rose in her pale night gown 
0	she drew in the heavy casement
0	and pushed the latches down 
0	he bade his heart go to her 
0	when the owls called out no more 
0	in a red and quivering garment
0	it sang to her through the door 
0	it had grown sweet tongued by dreaming 
0	of a flutter of flower like hair 
0	but she took up her fan from the table
0	and waved it off on the air 
0	 i have cap and bells he pondered 
0	 i will send them to her and die 
0	and when the morning whitened
0	he left them where she went by 
0	she laid them upon her bosom 
0	under a cloud of her hair 
0	and her red lips sang them a love song 
0	till stars grew out of the air 
0	she opened her door and her window 
0	and the heart and the soul came through 
0	to her right hand came the red one 
0	to her left hand came the blue 
0	they set up a noise like crickets 
0	a chattering wise and sweet 
0	and her hair was a folded flower
0	and the quiet of love in her feet 
0	the dews drop slowly and dreams gather unknown spears
0	suddenly hurtle before my dream awakened eyes 
0	and then the clash of fallen horsemen and the cries
0	of unknown perishing armies beat about my ears 
0	we who still labour by the cromlec on the shore 
0	the grey cairn on the hill when day sinks drowned in dew 
0	being weary of the world s empires bow down to you
0	master of the still stars and of the flaming door 
0	if this importunate heart trouble your peace
0	with words lighter than air 
0	or hopes that in mere hoping flicker and cease 
0	crumple the rose in your hair 
0	and cover your lips with odorous twilight and say 
0	 o hearts of wind blown flame 
0	 o winds elder than changing of night and day 
0	 that murmuring and longing came 
0	 from marble cities loud with tabors of old
0	 in dove gray faery lands 
0	 from battle banners fold upon purple fold 
0	 queens wrought with glimmering hands 
0	 that saw young niamh hover with love lorn face
0	 above the wandering tide 
0	 and lingered in the hidden desolate place 
0	 where the last phoenix died
0	 and wrapped the flames above his holy head 
0	 and still murmur and long 
0	 o piteous hearts changing till change be dead
0	 in a tumultuous song 
0	and cover the pale blossoms of your breast
0	with your dim heavy hair 
0	and trouble with a sigh for all things longing for rest
0	the odorous twilight there 
0	i dreamed that i stood in a valley and amid sighs 
0	for happy lovers passed two by two where i stood 
0	and i dreamed my lost love came stealthily out of the wood
0	with her cloud pale eyelids falling on dream dimmed eyes 
0	i cried in my dream o women bid the young men lay
0	 their heads on your knees and drown their eyes with your hair 
0	 or remembering hers they will find no other face fair
0	 till all the valleys of the world have been withered away 
0	o cloud pale eyelids dream dimmed eyes
0	the poets labouring all their days
0	to build a perfect beauty in rhyme
0	are overthrown by a woman s gaze
0	and by the unlabouring brood of the skies 
0	and therefore my heart will bow when dew
0	is dropping sleep until god burn time 
0	before the unlabouring stars and you 
0	i wander by the edge
0	of this desolate lake
0	where wind cries in the sedge
0	 until the axle break
0	that keeps the stars in their round
0	and hands hurl in the deep
0	the banners of east and west
0	and the girdle of light is unbound 
0	your breast will not lie by the breast
0	of your beloved in sleep 
0	half close your eyelids loosen your hair 
0	and dream about the great and their pride 
0	they have spoken against you everywhere 
0	but weigh this song with the great and their pride 
0	i made it out of a mouthful of air 
0	their children s children shall say they have lied 
0	cumhal called out bending his head 
0	till dathi came and stood 
0	with a blink in his eyes at the cave mouth 
0	between the wind and the wood 
0	and cumhal said bending his knees 
0	 i have come by the windy way
0	 to gather the half of your blessedness
0	 and learn to pray when you pray 
0	 i can bring you salmon out of the streams
0	 and heron out of the skies 
0	but dathi folded his hands and smiled
0	with the secrets of god in his eyes 
0	and cumhal saw like a drifting smoke
0	all manner of blessed souls 
0	women and children young men with books 
0	and old men with croziers and stoles 
0	 praise god and god s mother dathi said 
0	 for god and god s mother have sent
0	 the blessedest souls that walk in the world
0	 to fill your heart with content 
0	 and which is the blessedest cumhal said 
0	 where all are comely and good 
0	 is it these that with golden thuribles
0	 are singing about the wood 
0	 my eyes are blinking dathi said 
0	 with the secrets of god half blind 
0	 but i can see where the wind goes
0	 and follow the way of the wind 
0	 and blessedness goes where the wind goes 
0	 and when it is gone we are dead 
0	 i see the blessedest soul in the world
0	 and he nods a drunken head 
0	 o blessedness comes in the night and the day
0	 and whither the wise heart knows 
0	 and one has seen in the redness of wine
0	 that drowsily drops faint leaves on him
0	 and the sweetness of desire 
0	 while time and the world are ebbing away
0	 in twilights of dew and of fire 
0	far off most secret and inviolate rose 
0	enfold me in my hour of hours where those
0	who sought thee in the holy sepulchre 
0	or in the wine vat dwell beyond the stir
0	and tumult of defeated dreams and deep
0	among pale eyelids heavy with the sleep
0	men have named beauty thy great leaves enfold
0	the ancient beards the helms of ruby and gold
0	of the crowned magi and the king whose eyes
0	saw the pierced hands and rood of elder rise
0	in druid vapour and make the torches dim 
0	till vain frenzy awoke and he died and him
0	who met fand walking among flaming dew
0	by a gray shore where the wind never blew 
0	and lost the world and emer for a kiss 
0	and him who drove the gods out of their liss 
0	and till a hundred morns had flowered red 
0	feasted and wept the barrows of his dead 
0	and the proud dreaming king who flung the crown
0	and sorrow away and calling bard and clown
0	dwelt among wine stained wanderers in deep woods 
0	and him who sold tillage and house and goods 
0	and sought through lands and islands numberless years 
0	until he found with laughter and with tears 
0	a woman of so shining loveliness 
0	that men threshed corn at midnight by a tress 
0	a little stolen tress i too await
0	the hour of thy great wind of love and hate 
0	when shall the stars be blown about the sky 
0	like the sparks blown out of a smithy and die 
0	surely thine hour has come thy great wind blows 
0	far off most secret and inviolate rose 
0	o where is our mother of peace
0	nodding her purple hood 
0	for the winds that awakened the stars
0	are blowing through my blood 
0	i would that the death pale deer
0	had come through the mountain side 
0	and trampled the mountain away 
0	and drunk up the murmuring tide 
0	for the winds that awakened the stars
0	are blowing through my blood 
0	and our mother of peace has forgot me
0	under her purple hood 
0	when the flaming lute thronged angelic door is wide 
0	when an immortal passion breathes in mortal clay 
0	our hearts endure the scourge the plaited thorns the way
0	crowded with bitter faces the wounds in palm and side 
0	the hyssop heavy sponge the flowers by kidron stream 
0	we will bend down and loosen our hair over you 
0	that it may drop faint perfume and be heavy with dew 
0	lilies of death pale hope roses of passionate dream 
0	though you are in your shining days 
0	voices among the crowd
0	and new friends busy with your praise 
0	be not unkind or proud 
0	but think about old friends the most 
0	time s bitter flood will rise 
0	your beauty perish and be lost
0	for all eyes but these eyes 
0	o colleens kneeling by your altar rails long hence 
0	when songs i wove for my beloved hide the prayer 
0	and smoke from this dead heart drifts through the violet air
0	and covers away the smoke of myrrh and frankincense 
0	bend down and pray for the great sin i wove in song 
0	till maurya of the wounded heart cry a sweet cry 
0	and call to my beloved and me no longer fly
0	 amid the hovering piteous penitential throng 
0	the powers whose name and shape no living creature knows
0	have pulled the immortal rose 
0	and though the seven lights bowed in their dance and wept 
0	the polar dragon slept 
0	his heavy rings uncoiled from glimmering deep to deep 
0	when will he wake from sleep 
0	great powers of falling wave and wind and windy fire 
0	with your harmonious choir
0	encircle her i love and sing her into peace 
0	that my old care may cease 
0	unfold your flaming wings and cover out of sight
0	the nets of day and night 
0	dim powers of drowsy thought let her no longer be
0	like the pale cup of the sea 
0	when winds have gathered and sun and moon burned dim
0	above its cloudy rim 
0	but let a gentle silence wrought with music flow
0	whither her footsteps go 
0	were you but lying cold and dead 
0	and lights were paling out of the west 
0	you would come hither and bend your head 
0	and i would lay my head on your breast 
0	and you would murmur tender words 
0	forgiving me because you were dead 
0	nor would you rise and hasten away 
0	though you have the will of the wild birds 
0	but know your hair was bound and wound
0	about the stars and moon and sun 
0	o would beloved that you lay
0	under the dock leaves in the ground 
0	while lights were paling one by one 
0	had i the heavens embroidered cloths 
0	enwrought with golden and silver light 
0	the blue and the dim and the dark cloths
0	of night and light and the half light 
0	i would spread the cloths under your feet 
0	but i being poor have only my dreams 
0	i have spread my dreams under your feet 
0	tread softly because you tread on my dreams 
0	i have drunk ale from the country of the young
0	and weep because i know all things now 
0	i have been a hazel tree and they hung
0	among my leaves in times out of mind 
0	i became a rush that horses tread 
0	i became a man a hater of the wind 
0	knowing one out of all things alone that his head
0	would not lie on the breast or his lips on the hair
0	of the woman that he loves until he dies 
0	although the rushes and the fowl of the air
0	cry of his love with their pitiful cries 
0	a woman near gort in galway says there is a boy now of the
0	 o beautiful woman come with me to the marvellous land where one
0	i use the wind as a symbol of vague desires and hopes not merely
0	my deer and hound are properly related to the deer and hound that
0	somewhere 
0	 i am but an empty shade 
0	far from life and passion laid 
0	yet does sweet remembrance thrill
0	all my shadowy being still 
0	presently because of his great love he gave up his throne to
0	i have founded him who sold tillage and house and goods upon
0	and over the grave of clooth na bare 
0	caolte tossing his burning hair
0	and niamh calling away come away 
0	empty your heart of its mortal dream 
0	the winds awaken the leaves whirl round 
0	our cheeks are pale our hair is unbound 
0	our breasts are heaving our eyes are a gleam 
0	our arms are waving our lips are apart 
0	and if any gaze on our rushing band 
0	we come between him and the deed of his hand

0	shemus muttering 
0	what music music 
0	ah do not blame the finger on the string 
0	the doctors bid me fly the unlucky times
0	and find distraction for my thoughts or else
0	pine to my grave 
0	i have said nothing lady 
0	why should the like of us complain 
0	have done 
0	sorrows that she s but read of in a book
0	weigh on her mind as if they had been her own 
0	aleel singing 
0	i know who d measure out his length 
0	i know the heads that i should break 
0	there all s out now to leave or take 
0	and who mocks music mocks at love 
0	i ll not go far to choose 
0	 snapping his fingers in shemus face 
0	i know the heads that i shall break 
0	 he takes a step towards the door and then turns again 
0	shut to the door before the night has fallen 
0	for who can say what walks or in what shape
0	some devilish creature flies in the air but now
0	two grey horned owls hooted above our heads 
0	so that fool s gone 
0	he s seen the horned owls too 
0	there s no good luck in owls but it may be
0	that the ill luck s to fall upon his head 
0	you never thanked her ladyship 
0	thank her 
0	for seven halfpence and a silver bit 
0	but for this empty purse 
0	what s that for thanks 
0	or what s the double of it that she promised 
0	with bread and flesh and every sort of food
0	up to a price no man has heard the like of
0	and rising every day 
0	we have all she had 
0	she emptied out the purse before our eyes 
0	shemus to mary who has gone to close the door 
0	leave that door open 
0	when those that have read books 
0	and seen the seven wonders of the world 
0	fear what s above or what s below the ground 
0	it s time that poverty should bolt the door 
0	i ll have no bolts for there is not a thing
0	that walks above the ground or under it
0	i had not rather welcome to this house
0	than any more of mankind rich or poor 
0	so that they brought us money 
0	i heard say
0	there s something that appears like a white bird 
0	a pigeon or a seagull or the like 
0	but if you hit it with a stone or a stick
0	it clangs as though it had been made of brass 
0	and that if you dig down where it was scratching
0	you ll find a crock of gold 
0	but dream of gold
0	for three nights running and there s always gold 
0	you might be starved before you ve dug it out 
0	but maybe if you called something would come 
0	they have been seen of late 
0	is it call devils 
0	call devils from the wood call them in here 
0	so you d stand up against me and you d say
0	who or what i am to welcome here he hits her 
0	that is to show who s master 
0	call them in 
0	god help us all 
0	pray if you have a mind to 
0	it s little that the sleepy ears above
0	care for your words but i ll call what i please 
0	there is many a one they say had money from them 
0	shemus at door 
0	whatever you are that walk the woods at night 
0	so be it that you have not shouldered up
0	out of a grave for i ll have nothing human 
0	and have free hands a friendly trick of speech 
0	i welcome you come sit beside the fire 
0	what matter if your head s below your arms
0	or you ve a horse s tail to whip your flank 
0	feathers instead of hair that s but a straw 
0	come share what bread and meat is in the house 
0	and stretch your heels and warm them in the ashes 
0	and after that let s share and share alike
0	and curse all men and women come in come in 
0	what is there no one there turning from door 
0	and yet they say
0	they are as common as the grass and ride
0	even upon the book in the priest s hand 
0	 teig lifts one arm slowly and points toward the door and begins
0	deliberately when they are seated they take money out of
0	embroidered purses at their girdles and begin arranging it on the
0	you speak to them 
0	 twas you that called them 
0	shemus coming nearer 
0	i d make so bold if you would pardon it 
0	to ask if there s a thing you d have of us 
0	although we are but poor people if there is 
0	we ve travelled a long road 
0	for we are merchants that must tramp the world 
0	and now we look for supper and a fire
0	and a safe corner to count money in 
0	i thought you were but that s no matter now 
0	there had been words between my wife and me
0	because i said i would be master here 
0	and ask in what i pleased or who i pleased
0	and so but that is nothing to the point 
0	because it s certain that you are but merchants 
0	we travel for the master of all merchants 
0	yet if you were that i had thought but now
0	i d welcome you no less be what you please
0	and you ll have supper at the market rate 
0	that means that what was sold for but a penny
0	is now worth fifty 
0	 merchants begin putting money on carpet 
0	our master bids us pay
0	so good a price that all who deal with us
0	shall eat drink and be merry 
0	bestir yourself 
0	go kill and draw the fowl while teig and i
0	lay out the plates and make a better fire 
0	i will not cook for you 
0	not cook not cook 
0	do not be angry she wants to pay me back
0	because i struck her in that argument 
0	but she ll get sense again since the dearth came
0	we rattle one on another as though we were
0	knives thrown into a basket to be cleaned 
0	i will not cook for you because i know
0	in what unlucky shape you sat but now
0	outside this door 
0	it s this your honours 
0	because of some wild words my father said
0	she thinks you are not of those who cast a shadow 
0	i said i d make the devils of the wood
0	welcome if they d a mind to eat and drink 
0	but it is certain that you are men like us 
0	it s strange that she should think we cast no shadow 
0	for there is nothing on the ridge of the world
0	that s more substantial than the merchants are
0	that buy and sell you 
0	if you are not demons 
0	and seeing what great wealth is spread out there 
0	give food or money to the starving poor 
0	if we knew how to find deserving poor
0	we d do our share 
0	but seek them patiently 
0	we know the evils of mere charity 
0	those scruples may befit a common time 
0	i had thought there was a pushing to and fro 
0	at times like this that overset the scale
0	and trampled measure down 
0	but if already
0	we d thought of a more prudent way than that 
0	if each one brings a bit of merchandise 
0	we ll give him such a price he never dreamt of 
0	where shall the starving come at merchandise 
0	we will ask nothing but what all men have 
0	their swine and cattle fields and implements
0	are sold and gone 
0	they have not sold all yet 
0	for there s a vaporous thing that may be nothing 
0	but that s the buyer s risk a second self 
0	they call immortal for a story s sake 
0	they come to buy our souls 
0	i ll barter mine 
0	why should we starve for what may be but nothing 
0	what can it be but nothing 
0	what has god poured out of his bag but famine 
0	satan gives money 
0	yet no thunder stirs 
0	there is a heap for each 
0	 shemus goes to take money 
0	but no not yet 
0	for there s a work i have to set you to 
0	so then you re as deceitful as the rest 
0	and all that talk of buying what s but a vapour
0	is fancy bread i might have known as much 
0	because that s how the trick o the loop man talks 
0	that s for the work each has its separate price 
0	but neither price is paid till the work s done 
0	the same for me 
0	oh god why are you still 
0	you ve but to cry aloud at every cross road 
0	at every house door that we buy men s souls 
0	and give so good a price that all may live
0	in mirth and comfort till the famine s done 
0	because we are christian men 
0	come let s away 
0	i shall keep running till i ve earned the price 
0	 who has risen and gone towards fire 
0	stop you must have proof behind the words 
0	so here s your entertainment on the road 
0	 he throws a bag of money on the ground 
0	live as you please our master s generous 
0	destroyers of souls god will destroy you quickly 
0	you shall at last dry like dry leaves and hang
0	nailed like dead vermin to the doors of god 
0	curse to your fill for saints will have their dreams 
0	though we re but vermin that our master sent
0	to overrun the world he at the end
0	shall pull apart the pale ribs of the moon
0	and quench the stars in the ancestral night 
0	god is all powerful 
0	pray you shall need him 
0	you shall eat dock and grass and dandelion 
0	till that low threshold there becomes a wall 
0	and when your hands can scarcely drag your body
0	we shall be near you 
0	our faces go unscratched 
0	wring the neck o that fowl scatter the flour
0	and look if there is bread upon the shelves 
0	we ll turn the fowl upon the spit and roast it 
0	and eat the supper we were bidden to 
0	now that the house is quiet praise our master 
0	and stretch and warm our heels among the ashes 
0	front scene a wood with perhaps distant view of turreted house
0	against a diapered or gold background 
0	cathleen stopping 
0	surely this leafy corner where one smells
0	the wild bee s honey has a story too 
0	there is the house at last 
0	a man they say 
0	loved maeve the queen of all the invisible host 
0	and died of his love nine centuries ago 
0	and now when the moon s riding at the full 
0	she leaves her dancers lonely and lies there
0	upon that level place and for three days
0	stretches and sighs and wets her long pale cheeks 
0	so she loves truly 
0	no but wets her cheeks 
0	lady because she has forgot his name 
0	she d sleep that trouble away though it must be
0	a heavy trouble to forget his name 
0	if she had better sense 
0	your own house lady 
0	she sleeps high up on wintry knock na rea
0	in an old cairn of stones while her poor women
0	must lie and jog in the wave if they would sleep 
0	being water born yet if she cry their names
0	they run up on the land and dance in the moon
0	till they are giddy and would love as men do 
0	and be as patient and as pitiful 
0	but there is nothing that will stop in their heads
0	they ve such poor memories though they weep for it 
0	oh yes they weep that s when the moon is full 
0	is it because they have short memories
0	they live so long 
0	what s memory but the ash
0	that chokes our fires that have begun to sink 
0	and they ve a dizzy everlasting fire 
0	there is your own house lady 
0	why that s true 
0	and we d have passed it without noticing 
0	a curse upon it for a meddlesome house 
0	had it but stayed away i would have known
0	what queen maeve thinks on when the moon is pinched 
0	and whether now as in the old days the dancers
0	set their brief love on men 
0	rest on my arm 
0	these are no thoughts for any christian ear 
0	i am younger she would be too heavy for you 
0	this hollow box remembers every foot
0	that danced upon the level grass of the world 
0	and will tell secrets if i whisper to it 
0	lift up the white knee 
0	hear what they sing 
0	those young dancers
0	that in a ring
0	of the hearts that brake
0	long long ago
0	for their sake 
0	new friends are sweet 
0	 but the dance changes 
0	lift up the gown 
0	all that sorrow
0	is trodden down 
0	the empty rattle pate lean on this arm 
0	that i can tell you is a christened arm 
0	and not like some if we are to judge by speech 
0	but as you please it is time i was forgot 
0	maybe it is not on this arm you slumbered
0	when you were as helpless as a worm 
0	stay with me till we come to your own house 
0	cathleen sitting down 
0	when i am rested i will need no help 
0	i thought to have kept her from remembering
0	the evil of the times for full ten minutes 
0	but now when seven are out you come between 
0	talk on what does it matter what you say 
0	for you have not been christened 
0	old woman old woman 
0	you robbed her of three minutes peace of mind 
0	and though you live unto a hundred years 
0	and wash the feet of beggars and give alms 
0	and climb croaghpatrick you shall not be pardoned 
0	how does a man who never was baptized
0	know what heaven pardons 
0	you are a sinful woman 
0	i care no more than if a pig had grunted 
0	i am not to blame for i had locked the gate 
0	the forester s to blame the men climbed in
0	at the east corner where the elm tree is 
0	i do not understand you who has climbed 
0	then god be thanked i am the first to tell you 
0	i was afraid some other of the servants 
0	though i ve been on the watch had been the first 
0	and mixed up truth and lies your ladyship 
0	cathleen rising 
0	has some misfortune happened 
0	yes indeed 
0	the forester that let the branches lie
0	against the wall s to blame for everything 
0	for that is how the rogues got into the garden 
0	i thought to have escaped misfortune here 
0	has any one been killed 
0	oh no not killed 
0	they have stolen half a cart load of green cabbage 
0	but maybe they were starving 
0	that is certain 
0	to rob or starve that was the choice they had 
0	a learned theologian has laid down
0	that starving men may take what s necessary 
0	and yet be sinless 
0	sinless and a thief 
0	there should be broken bottles on the wall 
0	and if it be a sin while faith s unbroken
0	god cannot help but pardon there is no soul
0	but it s unlike all others in the world 
0	nor one but lifts a strangeness to god s love
0	till that s grown infinite and therefore none
0	whose loss were less than irremediable
0	although it were the wickedest in the world 
0	what are you running for pull off your cap 
0	do you not see who s there 
0	i cannot wait 
0	i am running to the world with the best news
0	that has been brought it for a thousand years 
0	then get your breath and speak 
0	if you d my news
0	you d run as fast and be as out of breath 
0	such news we shall be carried on men s shoulders 
0	there s something every man has carried with him
0	and thought no more about than if it were
0	a mouthful of the wind and now it s grown
0	a marketable thing 
0	and yet it seemed
0	as useless as the paring of one s nails 
0	what sets me laughing when i think of it 
0	is that a rogue who s lain in lousy straw 
0	if he but sell it may set up his coach 
0	teig laughing 
0	there are two gentlemen who buy men s souls 
0	and maybe there s no soul at all 
0	they re drunk or mad 
0	look at the price they give 
0	shemus tossing up money 
0	 go cry it all about the world they said 
0	 money for souls good money for a soul 
0	give twice and thrice and twenty times their money 
0	and get your souls again i will pay all 
0	not we not we for souls if there are souls 
0	but keep the flesh out of its merriment 
0	i shall be drunk and merry 
0	come let s away 
0	but there s a world to come 
0	and if there is 
0	i d rather trust myself into the hands
0	that can pay money down than to the hands
0	that have but shaken famine from the bag 
0	 there s money for a soul sweet yellow money 
0	there s money for men s souls good money money 
0	go call them here again bring them by force 
0	beseech them bribe do anything you like 
0	and you too follow add your prayers to his 
0	 oona who has been praying goes out 
0	steward you know the secrets of my house 
0	how much have i 
0	a hundred kegs of gold 
0	how much have i in castles 
0	as much more 
0	how much have i in pasture 
0	as much more 
0	how much have i in forests 
0	as much more 
0	keeping this house alone sell all i have 
0	go barter where you please but come again
0	with herds of cattle and with ships of meal 
0	god s blessing light upon your ladyship 
0	you will have saved the land 
0	make no delay 
0	 aleel and oona return 
0	they have not come speak quickly 
0	one drew his knife
0	and said that he would kill the man or woman
0	that stopped his way and when i would have stopped him
0	he made this stroke at me but it is nothing 
0	you shall be tended from this day for ever
0	i ll have no joy or sorrow of my own 
0	their eyes shone like the eyes of birds of prey 
0	come follow me for the earth burns my feet
0	till i have changed my house to such a refuge
0	that the old and ailing and all weak of heart 
0	may escape from beak and claw all all shall come
0	till the walls burst and the roof fall on us 
0	from this day out i have nothing of my own 
0	she has found something now to put her hand to 
0	and you and i are of no more account
0	than flies upon a window pane in the winter 
0	scene hall in the house of countess cathleen at the left an
0	wall more or less repeating the form of the oratory and a great
0	cathleen is kneeling in front of the altar in the oratory there
0	i have come to bid you leave this castle and fly
0	out of these woods 
0	what evil is there here
0	that is not everywhere from this to the sea 
0	they who have sent me walk invisible 
0	so it is true what i have heard men say 
0	that you have seen and heard what others cannot 
0	i was asleep in my bed and while i slept
0	my dream became a fire and in the fire
0	one walked and he had birds about his head 
0	i have heard that one of the old gods walked so 
0	it may be that he is angelical 
0	and lady he bids me call you from these woods 
0	and you must bring but your old foster mother 
0	and some few serving men and live in the hills 
0	among the sounds of music and the light
0	of waters till the evil days are done 
0	for here some terrible death is waiting you 
0	some unimagined evil some great darkness
0	that fable has not dreamt of nor sun nor moon
0	no not angelical 
0	this house
0	you are to leave with some old trusty man 
0	and bid him shelter all that starve or wander
0	while there is food and house room 
0	he bids me go
0	where none of mortal creatures but the swan
0	dabbles and there you would pluck the harp when the trees
0	had made a heavy shadow about our door 
0	and talk among the rustling of the reeds 
0	when night hunted the foolish sun away
0	with stillness and pale tapers no no no 
0	i cannot although i weep i do not weep
0	because that life would be most happy and here
0	i find no way no end nor do i weep
0	because i had longed to look upon your face 
0	but that a night of prayer has made me weary 
0	aleel prostrating himself before her 
0	let him that made mankind the angels and devils
0	and dearth and plenty mend what he has made 
0	for when we labour in vain and eye still sees
0	heart breaks in vain 
0	how would that quiet end 
0	how but in healing 
0	you have seen my tears
0	and i can see your hand shake on the floor 
0	aleel faltering 
0	i thought but of healing he was angelical 
0	cathleen turning away from him 
0	no not angelical but of the old gods 
0	who wander about the world to waken the heart 
0	the passionate proud heart that all the angels 
0	leaving nine heavens empty would rock to sleep 
0	do not hold out to me beseeching hands 
0	this heart shall never waken on earth i have sworn 
0	by her whose heart the seven sorrows have pierced 
0	to pray before this altar until my heart
0	has grown to heaven like a tree and there
0	rustled its leaves till heaven has saved my people 
0	aleel who has risen 
0	when one so great has spoken of love to one
0	so little as i though to deny him love 
0	what can he but hold out beseeching hands 
0	then let them fall beside him knowing how greatly
0	they have overdared 
0	if the old tales are true 
0	queens have wed shepherds and kings beggar maids 
0	god s procreant waters flowing about your mind
0	have made you more than kings or queens and not you
0	but i am the empty pitcher 
0	being silent 
0	i have said all yet let me stay beside you 
0	no no not while my heart is shaken no 
0	but you shall hear wind cry and water cry 
0	and curlew cry and have the peace i longed for 
0	give me your hand to kiss 
0	i kiss your forehead 
0	and yet i send you from me do not speak 
0	there have been women that bid men to rob
0	crowns from the country under wave or apples
0	upon a dragon guarded hill and all
0	that they might sift men s hearts and wills 
0	and trembled as they bid it as i tremble
0	that lay a hard task on you that you go 
0	and silently and do not turn your head 
0	goodbye but do not turn your head and look 
0	above all else i would not have you look 
0	i never spoke to him of his wounded hand 
0	and now he is gone she looks out 
0	i cannot see him for all is dark outside 
0	would my imagination and my heart
0	were as little shaken as this holy flame 
0	they are ringing the alarm and in a moment
0	they ll be upon us 
0	first merchant going to a door at the side 
0	you d my commands to put them all to sleep 
0	some angel or else her prayers protected them 
0	she has fallen asleep 
0	we ve all the treasure now 
0	so let s away before they ve tracked us out 
0	i have a plan to win her 
0	you have time enough
0	if you would kill her and bear off her soul
0	before they are upon us with their prayers 
0	they search the western tower 
0	we cannot face the heavenly host in arms 
0	her soul must come to us of its own will 
0	but being of the ninth and mightiest hell
0	where all are kings i have a plan to win it 
0	lady we ve news that s crying out for speech 
0	 cathleen wakes and comes to door of chapel 
0	who calls 
0	we have brought news 
0	what are you 
0	we are merchants and we know the book of the world
0	because we have walked upon its leaves and there
0	have read of late matters that much concern you 
0	and noticing the castle door stand open 
0	came in to find an ear 
0	the door stands open 
0	that no one who is famished or afraid 
0	despair of help or of a welcome with it 
0	but you have news you say 
0	we saw a man 
0	heavy with sickness in the bog of allen 
0	whom you had bid buy cattle near fair head
0	we saw your grain ships lying all becalmed
0	in the dark night and not less still than they 
0	burned all their mirrored lanthorns in the sea 
0	my thanks to god to mary and the angels 
0	that i have money in my treasury 
0	and can buy grain from those who have stored it up
0	to prosper on the hunger of the poor 
0	but you ve been far and know the signs of things 
0	when will this famine end 
0	day copies day 
0	and there s no sign of change nor can it change 
0	with the wheat withered and the cattle dead 
0	and heard you of the demons who buy souls 
0	there are some men who hold they have wolves heads 
0	and say their limbs dried by the infinite flame 
0	have all the speed of storms others again 
0	say they are gross and little while a few
0	will have it they seem much as mortals are 
0	but tall and brown and travelled like us lady 
0	yet all agree a power is in their looks
0	that makes men bow and flings a casting net
0	about their souls and that all men would go
0	and barter those poor vapours were it not
0	you bribe them with the safety of your gold 
0	praise be to god to mary and the angels
0	that i am wealthy wherefore do they sell 
0	as we came in at the great door we saw
0	your porter sleeping in his niche a soul
0	too little to be worth a hundred pence 
0	and yet they buy it for a hundred crowns 
0	but for a soul like yours i heard them say 
0	they would give five hundred thousand crowns and more 
0	how can a heap of crowns pay for a soul 
0	is the green grave so terrible a thing 
0	some sell because the money gleams and some
0	because they are in terror of the grave 
0	and some because their neighbours sold before 
0	and some because there is a kind of joy
0	in casting hope away in losing joy 
0	in ceasing all resistance in at last
0	opening one s arms to the eternal flames 
0	in casting all sails out upon the wind 
0	to this full of the gaiety of the lost 
0	would all folk hurry if your gold were gone 
0	there is a something merchant in your voice
0	that makes me fear when you were telling how
0	a man may lose his soul and lose his god
0	your eyes were lighted up and when you told
0	how my poor money serves the people both 
0	merchants forgive me seemed to smile 
0	i laugh
0	to think that all these people should be swung
0	as on a lady s shoe string under them
0	the glowing leagues of never ending flame 
0	there is a something in you that i fear 
0	a something not of us were you not born
0	in some most distant corner of the world 
0	away now they are in the passage hurry 
0	for they will know us and freeze up our hearts
0	with ave marys and burn all our skin
0	with holy water 
0	farewell for we must ride
0	many a mile before the morning come 
0	our horses beat the ground impatiently 
0	 they go out a number of peasants enter by other door 
0	forgive us lady but we heard a noise 
0	we sat by the fireside telling vanities 
0	we heard a noise but though we have searched the house
0	we have found nobody 
0	you are too timid 
0	for now you are safe from all the evil times 
0	there is no evil that can find you here

0	that my good mistress should lose all this money 
0	let those among you not too old to ride

0	old man old man he never closed a door
0	unless one opened i am desolate 
0	because of a strange thought that s in my heart 
0	but i have still my faith therefore be silent 
0	for surely he does not forsake the world 
0	but stands before it modelling in the clay
0	and moulding there his image age by age
0	the clay wars with his fingers and pleads hard
0	for its old heavy dull and shapeless ease 
0	but sometimes though his hand is on it still 
0	it moves awry and demon hordes are born 
0	 peasants cross themselves 
0	yet leave me now for i am desolate 
0	i hear a whisper from beyond the thunder

0	we shall be too much thronged with souls to morrow 
0	what has she in her coffers now but mice 
0	when the night fell and i had shaped myself
0	into the image of the man headed owl

0	and saw with all their canvas full of wind
0	and rushing through the parti coloured sea
0	those ships that bring the woman grain and meal 
0	they re but three days from us

0	take up the money and now come with me 
0	when we are far from this polluted place
0	i will give everybody money enough 
0	 she goes out the peasants crowding round her and kissing her
0	we must away and wait until she dies 
0	sitting above her tower as two grey owls 
0	waiting as many years as may be guarding
0	we need but hover over her head in the air 
0	for she has only minutes when she signed
0	her heart began to break hush hush i hear
0	the brazen door of hell move on its hinges 
0	and the eternal revelry float hither
0	to hearten us 
0	leap feathered on the air
0	and meet them with her soul caught in your claws 
0	the brazen door stands wide and balor comes
0	borne in his heavy car and demons have lifted
0	the age weary eyelids from the eyes that of old
0	turned gods to stone barach the traitor comes
0	and the lascivious race cailitin 
0	that cast a druid weakness and decay
0	over sualtem s and old dectera s child 
0	and that great king hell first took hold upon
0	when he killed naisi and broke deirdre s heart
0	and all their heads are twisted to one side 
0	for when they lived they warred on beauty and peace
0	with obstinate crafty sidelong bitterness 
0	crouch down old heron out of the blind storm 
0	where is the countess cathleen all this day
0	her eyes were full of tears and when for a moment
0	her hand was laid upon my hand it trembled 
0	and now i do not know where she is gone 
0	cathleen has chosen other friends than us 
0	and they are rising through the hollow world 
0	demons are out old heron 
0	god guard her soul 
0	she s bartered it away this very hour 
0	as though we two were never in the world 
0	 he points downward 
0	first orchill her pale beautiful head
0	her body shadowy as vapour drifting
0	under the dawn for she who awoke desire
0	has but a heart of blood when others die 
0	about her is a vapoury multitude
0	of women alluring devils with soft laughter 
0	behind her a host heat of the blood made sin 
0	but all the little pink white nails have grown
0	to be great talons 
0	they begin a song
0	and there is still some music on their tongues 
0	oona casting herself face downwards on the floor 
0	o maker of all protect her from the demons 
0	and if a soul must need be lost take mine 
0	o that so many pitchers of rough clay
0	should prosper and the porcelain break in two 
0	 she kisses the hands of cathleen 
0	we were under the tree where the path turns 
0	when she grew pale as death and fainted away 
0	and while we bore her hither cloudy gusts
0	blackened the world and shook us on our feet 
0	draw the great bolt for no man has beheld
0	so black bitter blinding and sudden a storm 
0	 one who is near the door draws the bolt 
0	o hold me and hold me tightly for the storm
0	is dragging me away 
0	 oona takes her in her arms a woman begins to wail 
0	cathleen half rising 
0	lay all the bags of money in a heap 
0	and when i am gone old oona share them out
0	to every man and woman judge and give
0	according to their needs 
0	and will she give
0	enough to keep my children through the dearth 
0	o queen of heaven and all you blessed saints 
0	let us and ours be lost so she be shriven 
0	bend down your faces oona and aleel 
0	i gaze upon them as the swallow gazes
0	upon the nest under the eave before
0	she wander the loud waters do not weep
0	too great a while for there is many a candle
0	on the high altar though one fall aleel 
0	who sang about the dancers of the woods 
0	that know not the hard burden of the world 
0	having but breath in their kind bodies farewell 
0	and farewell oona you who played with me 
0	and bore me in your arms about the house
0	when i was but a child and therefore happy 
0	therefore happy even like those that dance 
0	the storm is in my hair and i must go 
0	bring me the looking glass 
0	o she is dead 
0	she was the great white lily of the world 
0	she was more beautiful than the pale stars 
0	the little plant i love is broken in two 
0	i shatter you in fragments for the face
0	that brimmed you up with beauty is no more 
0	and die dull heart for she whose mournful words
0	made you a living spirit has passed away
0	and left you but a ball of passionate dust 
0	and you proud earth and plumy sea fade out 
0	for you may hear no more her faltering feet 
0	but are left lonely amid the clamorous war
0	of angels upon devils 
0	and i who weep
0	call curses on you time and fate and change 
0	and have no excellent hope but the great hour
0	when you shall plunge headlong through bottomless space 
0	 a flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder 
0	pull him upon his knees before his curses
0	have plucked thunder and lightning on our heads 
0	angels and devils clash in the middle air 
0	and brazen swords clang upon brazen helms 
0	 a flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder 
0	yonder a bright spear cast out of a sling 
0	has torn through balor s eye and the dark clans
0	fly screaming as they fled moytura of old 
0	 everything is lost in darkness 
0	the almighty wrath at our great weakness and sin
0	has blotted out the world and we must die 
0	look no more on the half closed gates of hell 
0	but speak to me whose mind is smitten of god 
0	that it may be no more with mortal things 
0	and tell of her who lies there 
0	 he seizes one of the angels 
0	till you speak
0	you shall not drift into eternity 
0	the light beats down the gates of pearl are wide
0	and she is passing to the floor of peace 
0	and mary of the seven times wounded heart
0	has kissed her lips and the long blessed hair
0	has fallen on her face the light of lights
0	looks always on the motive not the deed 
0	the shadow of shadows on the deed alone 
0	 aleel releases the angel and kneels 
0	tell them who walk upon the floor of peace
0	that i would die and go to her i love 
0	the years like great black oxen tread the world 
0	and god the herdsman goads them on behind
0	and i am broken by their passing feet 
0	 sero te amavi pulchritudo tam antiqua et tam nova sero te
0	 red rose proud rose sad rose of all my days 
0	come near me while i sing the ancient ways 
0	cuchulain battling with the bitter tide 
0	the druid gray wood nurtured quiet eyed 
0	who cast round fergus dreams and ruin untold 
0	and thine own sadness whereof stars grown old
0	in dancing silver sandalled on the sea 
0	sing in their high and lonely melody 
0	come near that no more blinded by man s fate 
0	i find under the boughs of love and hate 
0	in all poor foolish things that live a day 
0	eternal beauty wandering on her way 
0	 come near come near come near ah leave me still
0	a little space for the rose breath to fill 
0	lest i no more hear common things that crave 
0	the weak worm hiding down in its small cave 
0	 the field mouse running by me in the grass 
0	and heavy mortal hopes that toil and pass 
0	but seek alone to hear the strange things said
0	by god to the bright hearts of those long dead 
0	and learn to chaunt a tongue men do not know 
0	come near i would before my time to go 
0	sing of old eire and the ancient ways 
0	red rose proud rose sad rose of all my days 
0	the whole day have i followed in the rocks 
0	and you have changed and flowed from shape to shape 
0	first as a raven on whose ancient wings
0	scarcely a feather lingered then you seemed
0	a weasel moving on from stone to stone 
0	and now at last you wear a human shape 
0	a thin gray man half lost in gathering night 
0	what would you king of the proud red branch kings 
0	this would i say most wise of living souls 
0	young subtle concobar sat close by me
0	when i gave judgment and his words were wise 
0	and what to me was burden without end 
0	to him seemed easy so i laid the crown
0	upon his head to cast away my care 
0	what would you king of the proud red branch kings 
0	i feast amid my people on the hill 
0	and pace the woods and drive my chariot wheels
0	in the white border of the murmuring sea 
0	and still i feel the crown upon my head 
0	what would you 
0	i would be no more a king
0	but learn the dreaming wisdom that is yours 
0	look on my thin gray hair and hollow cheeks
0	and on these hands that may not lift the sword
0	this body trembling like a wind blown reed 
0	no woman loves me no man seeks my help 
0	because i be not of the things i dream 
0	a wild and foolish labourer is a king 
0	to do and do and do and never dream 
0	take if you must this little bag of dreams 
0	unloose the cord and they will wrap you round 
0	i see my life go dripping like a stream
0	from change to change i have been many things 
0	a green drop in the surge a gleam of light
0	upon a sword a fir tree on a hill 
0	an old slave grinding at a heavy quern 
0	a king sitting upon a chair of gold 
0	and all these things were wonderful and great 
0	but now i have grown nothing being all 
0	and the whole world weighs down upon my heart 
0	ah druid druid how great webs of sorrow
0	lay hidden in the small slate coloured bag 
0	a man came slowly from the setting sun 
0	to forgail s daughter emer in her dun 
0	and found her dyeing cloth with subtle care 
0	and said casting aside his draggled hair 
0	 i am aleel the swineherd whom you bid
0	 go dwell upon the sea cliffs vapour hid 
0	 but now my years of watching are no more 
0	then emer cast the web upon the floor 
0	and stretching out her arms red with the dye 
0	parted her lips with a loud sudden cry 
0	looking on her aleel the swineherd said 
0	 not any god alive nor mortal dead 
0	 has slain so mighty armies so great kings 
0	 nor won the gold that now cuchulain brings 
0	 why do you tremble thus from feet to crown 
0	aleel the swineherd wept and cast him down
0	upon the web heaped floor and thus his word 
0	 with him is one sweet throated like a bird 
0	 who bade you tell these things and then she cried
0	to those about beat him with thongs of hide
0	 and drive him from the door 
0	and thus it was 
0	and where her son finmole on the smooth grass
0	was driving cattle came she with swift feet 
0	and called out to him son it is not meet
0	 that you stay idling here with flocks and herds 
0	 i have long waited mother for those words 
0	 but wherefore now 
0	 there is a man to die 
0	 you have the heaviest arm under the sky 
0	 my father dwells among the sea worn bands 
0	 and breaks the ridge of battle with his hands 
0	 nay you are taller than cuchulain son 
0	 he is the mightiest man in ship or dun 
0	 nay he is old and sad with many wars 
0	 and weary of the crash of battle cars 
0	 i only ask what way my journey lies 
0	 for god who made you bitter made you wise 
0	 the red branch kings a tireless banquet keep 
0	 where the sun falls into the western deep 
0	 go there and dwell on the green forest rim 
0	 but tell alone your name and house to him
0	 whose blade compels and bid them send you one
0	 who has a like vow from their triple dun 
0	between the lavish shelter of a wood
0	and the gray tide the red branch multitude
0	feasted and with them old cuchulain dwelt 
0	and his young dear one close beside him knelt 
0	and gazed upon the wisdom of his eyes 
0	more mournful than the depth of starry skies 
0	and pondered on the wonder of his days 
0	and all around the harp string told his praise 
0	and concobar the red branch king of kings 
0	with his own fingers touched the brazen strings 
0	at last cuchulain spake a young man strays
0	 driving the deer along the woody ways 
0	 i often hear him singing to and fro 
0	 i often hear the sweet sound of his bow 
0	 seek out what man he is 
0	one went and came 
0	 he bade me let all know he gives his name
0	 at the sword point and bade me bring him one
0	 who had a like vow from our triple dun 
0	 i only of the red branch hosted now 
0	cuchulain cried have made and keep that vow 
0	after short fighting in the leafy shade 
0	he spake to the young man is there no maid
0	 who loves you no white arms to wrap you round 
0	 or do you long for the dim sleepy ground 
0	 that you come here to meet this ancient sword 
0	 the dooms of men are in god s hidden hoard 
0	 your head a while seemed like a woman s head
0	 that i loved once 
0	again the fighting sped 
0	but now the war rage in cuchulain woke 
0	and through the other s shield his long blade broke 
0	and pierced him 
0	 speak before your breath is done 
0	 i am finmole mighty cuchulain s son 
0	 i put you from your pain i can no more 
0	while day its burden on to evening bore 
0	with head bowed on his knees cuchulain stayed 
0	then concobar sent that sweet throated maid 
0	and she to win him his gray hair caressed 
0	in vain her arms in vain her soft white breast 
0	then concobar the subtlest of all men 
0	ranking his druids round him ten by ten 
0	spake thus cuchulain will dwell there and brood 
0	 for three days more in dreadful quietude 
0	 and then arise and raving slay us all 
0	 go cast on him delusions magical 
0	 that he might fight the waves of the loud sea 
0	and ten by ten under a quicken tree 
0	the druids chaunted swaying in their hands
0	tall wands of alder and white quicken wands 
0	in three days time cuchulain with a moan
0	stood up and came to the long sands alone 
0	for four days warred he with the bitter tide 
0	and the waves flowed above him and he died 
0	who dreamed that beauty passes like a dream 
0	for these red lips with all their mournful pride 
0	mournful that no new wonder may betide 
0	troy passed away in one high funeral gleam 
0	and usna s children died 
0	we and the labouring world are passing by 
0	amid men s souls that waver and give place 
0	like the pale waters in their wintry race 
0	under the passing stars foam of the sky 
0	lives on this lonely face 
0	bow down archangels in your dim abode 
0	before you were or any hearts to beat 
0	weary and kind one lingered by his seat 
0	he made the world to be a grassy road
0	before her wandering feet 
0	if michael leader of god s host
0	when heaven and hell are met 
0	looked down on you from heaven s door post
0	he would his deeds forget 
0	brooding no more upon god s wars
0	in his divine homestead 
0	he would go weave out of the stars
0	a chaplet for your head 
0	and all folk seeing him bow down 
0	and white stars tell your praise 
0	would come at last to god s great town 
0	led on by gentle ways 
0	and god would bid his warfare cease 
0	saying all things were well 
0	and softly make a rosy peace 
0	a peace of heaven with hell 
0	the tall thought woven sails that flap unfurled
0	above the tide of hours trouble the air 
0	and god s bell buoyed to be the water s care 
0	while hushed from fear or loud with hope a band
0	with blown spray dabbled hair gather at hand 
0	 turn if you may from battles never done 
0	i call as they go by me one by one 
0	 danger no refuge holds and war no peace 
0	for him who hears love sing and never cease 
0	beside her clean swept hearth her quiet shade 
0	but gather all for whom no love hath made
0	a woven silence or but came to cast
0	a song into the air and singing past
0	to smile on the pale dawn and gather you
0	who have sought more than is in rain or dew
0	or in the sun and moon or on the earth 
0	 or sighs amid the wandering starry mirth 
0	or comes in laughter from the sea s sad lips
0	and wage god s battles in the long gray ships 
0	the sad the lonely the insatiable 
0	to these old night shall all her mystery tell 
0	god s bell has claimed them by the little cry
0	of their sad hearts that may not live nor die 
0	you too have come where the dim tides are hurled
0	upon the wharves of sorrow and heard ring
0	the bell that calls us on the sweet far thing 
0	beauty grown sad with its eternity
0	made you of us and of the dim gray sea 
0	our long ships loose thought woven sails and wait 
0	for god has bid them share an equal fate 
0	and when at last defeated in his wars 
0	they have gone down under the same white stars 
0	we shall no longer hear the little cry
0	of our sad hearts that may not live nor die 
0	 sung by the people of faery over diarmuid and grania who lay in
0	we who are old old and gay 
0	o so old 
0	thousands of years thousands of years 
0	if all were told 
0	give to these children new from the world 
0	silence and love 
0	and the long dew dropping hours of the night 
0	and the stars above 
0	give to these children new from the world 
0	rest far from men 
0	is anything better anything better 
0	tell us it then 
0	us who are old old and gay 
0	o so old 
0	thousands of years thousands of years 
0	if all were told 
0	i will arise and go now and go to innisfree 
0	and a small cabin build there of clay and wattles made 
0	nine bean rows will i have there a hive for the honey bee 
0	and live alone in the bee loud glade 
0	and i shall have some peace there for peace comes dropping slow 
0	and evening full of the linnet s wings 
0	i will arise and go now for always night and day
0	i hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore 
0	while i stand on the roadway or on the pavements gray 
0	i hear it in the deep heart s core 
0	 coth yani me von gilli beg 
0	 n heur ve thu more a creena 
0	the angels are stooping
0	above your bed 
0	they weary of trooping
0	with the whimpering dead 
0	god s laughing in heaven
0	to see you so good 
0	are gay with his mood 
0	i kiss you and kiss you 
0	my pigeon my own 
0	ah how i shall miss you
0	when you have grown 
0	a pity beyond all telling
0	is hid in the heart of love 
0	the folk who are buying and selling
0	the clouds on their journey above
0	the cold wet winds ever blowing
0	and the shadowy hazel grove
0	where mouse gray waters are flowing
0	threaten the head that i love 
0	the quarrel of the sparrows in the eaves 
0	the full round moon and the star laden sky 
0	and the loud song of the ever singing leaves 
0	had hid away earth s old and weary cry 
0	and then you came with those red mournful lips 
0	and with you came the whole of the world s tears
0	and all the trouble of her labouring ships 
0	and all the trouble of her myriad years 
0	and now the sparrows warring in the eaves 
0	the curd pale moon the white stars in the sky 
0	and the loud chaunting of the unquiet leaves 
0	are shaken with earth s old and weary cry 
0	when you are old and gray and full of sleep 
0	and nodding by the fire take down this book 
0	and slowly read and dream of the soft look
0	your eyes had once and of their shadows deep 
0	how many loved your moments of glad grace 
0	and loved your beauty will love false or true 
0	but one man loved the pilgrim soul in you 
0	and loved the sorrows of your changing face 
0	and bending down beside the glowing bars
0	murmur a little sadly how love fled
0	and paced upon the mountains overhead
0	and hid his face amid a crowd of stars 
0	and the flame of the blue star of twilight hung low
0	on the rim of the sky 
0	has awaked in our hearts my beloved a sadness that may not die 
0	in the fall of the dew 
0	for i would we were changed to white birds on the
0	wandering foam i and you 
0	i am haunted by numberless islands and many a danaan shore 
0	i dreamed that one had died in a strange place
0	near no accustomed hand 
0	and they had nailed the boards above her face
0	the peasants of that land 
0	wondering to lay her in that solitude 
0	and raised above her mound
0	a cross they had made out of two bits of wood 
0	and planted cypress round 
0	and left her to the indifferent stars above
0	until i carved these words 
0	 she was more beautiful than thy first love 
0	but now lies under boards 
0	all the heavy days are over 
0	leave the body s coloured pride
0	underneath the grass and clover 
0	with the feet laid side by side 
0	one with her are mirth and duty 
0	bear the gold embroidered dress 
0	for she needs not her sad beauty 
0	to the scented oaken press 
0	hers the kiss of mother mary 
0	the long hair is on her face 
0	still she goes with footsteps wary 
0	full of earth s old timid grace 
0	with white feet of angels seven
0	her white feet go glimmering
0	and above the deep of heaven 
0	flame on flame and wing on wing 
0	who will go drive with fergus now 
0	and pierce the deep wood s woven shade 
0	and dance upon the level shore 
0	young man lift up your russet brow 
0	and lift your tender eyelids maid 
0	and brood on hopes and fears no more 
0	and no more turn aside and brood
0	upon love s bitter mystery 
0	for fergus rules the brazen cars 
0	and rules the shadows of the wood 
0	and the white breast of the dim sea
0	and all dishevelled wandering stars 
0	he stood among a crowd at drumahair 
0	his heart hung all upon a silken dress 
0	and he had known at last some tenderness 
0	before earth made of him her sleepy care 
0	but when a man poured fish into a pile 
0	it seemed they raised their little silver heads 
0	and sang how day a druid twilight sheds
0	upon a dim green well beloved isle 
0	where people love beside star laden seas 
0	how time may never mar their faery vows
0	under the woven roofs of quicken boughs 
0	the singing shook him out of his new ease 
0	he wandered by the sands of lisadill 
0	his mind ran all on money cares and fears 
0	and he had known at last some prudent years
0	before they heaped his grave under the hill 
0	but while he passed before a plashy place 
0	a lug worm with its gray and muddy mouth
0	sang how somewhere to north or west or south
0	there dwelt a gay exulting gentle race 
0	and how beneath those three times blessed skies
0	a danaan fruitage makes a shower of moons 
0	and as it falls awakens leafy tunes 
0	and at that singing he was no more wise 
0	he mused beside the well of scanavin 
0	he mused upon his mockers without fail
0	his sudden vengeance were a country tale 
0	now that deep earth has drunk his body in 
0	but one small knot grass growing by the pool
0	told where ah little all unneeded voice 
0	old silence bids a lonely folk rejoice 
0	and how when fades the sea strewn rose of day 
0	a gentle feeling wraps them like a fleece 
0	and all their trouble dies into its peace 
0	the tale drove his fine angry mood away 
0	he slept under the hill of lugnagall 
0	under that cold and vapour turbaned steep 
0	now that old earth had taken man and all 
0	were not the worms that spired about his bones
0	a telling with their low and reedy cry 
0	of how god leans his hands out of the sky 
0	to bless that isle with honey in his tones 
0	that none may feel the power of squall and wave
0	and no one any leaf crowned dancer miss
0	until he burn up nature with a kiss 
0	the man has found no comfort in the grave 
0	there was a green branch hung with many a bell
0	when her own people ruled in wave worn eire 
0	and from its murmuring greenness calm of faery 
0	a druid kindness on all hearers fell 
0	it charmed away the merchant from his guile 
0	and turned the farmer s memory from his cattle 
0	and hushed in sleep the roaring ranks of battle 
0	for all who heard it dreamed a little while 
0	ah exiles wandering over many seas 
0	spinning at all times eire s good to morrow 
0	ah worldwide nation always growing sorrow 
0	i also bear a bell branch full of ease 
0	i tore it from green boughs winds tossed and hurled 
0	green boughs of tossing always weary weary 
0	i tore it from the green boughs of old eire 
0	the willow of the many sorrowed world 
0	ah exiles wandering over many lands 
0	my bell branch murmurs the gay bells bring laughter 
0	leaping to shake a cobweb from the rafter 
0	the sad bells bow the forehead on the hands 
0	a honeyed ringing under the new skies
0	they bring you memories of old village faces 
0	cabins gone now old well sides old dear places 
0	and men who loved the cause that never dies 
0	i had a chair at every hearth 
0	when no one turned to see 
0	with look at that old fellow there 
0	 and who may he be 
0	and therefore do i wander now 
0	and the fret lies on me 
0	the road side trees keep murmuring
0	ah wherefore murmur ye 
0	as in the old days long gone by 
0	green oak and poplar tree 
0	the well known faces are all gone
0	and the fret lies on me 
0	the old priest peter gilligan
0	was weary night and day 
0	for half his flock were in their beds 
0	or under green sods lay 
0	once while he nodded on a chair 
0	at the moth hour of eve 
0	another poor man sent for him 
0	and he began to grieve 
0	 i have no rest nor joy nor peace 
0	 for people die and die 
0	and after cried he god forgive 
0	 my body spake not i 
0	he knelt and leaning on the chair
0	he prayed and fell asleep 
0	and the moth hour went from the fields 
0	and stars began to peep 
0	they slowly into millions grew 
0	and leaves shook in the wind 
0	and god covered the world with shade 
0	and whispered to mankind 
0	upon the time of sparrow chirp
0	when the moths came once more 
0	the old priest peter gilligan
0	stood upright on the floor 
0	 mavrone mavrone the man has died 
0	 while i slept on the chair 
0	he roused his horse out of its sleep 
0	and rode with little care 
0	he rode now as he never rode 
0	by rocky lane and fen 
0	the sick man s wife opened the door 
0	 father you come again 
0	 and is the poor man dead he cried 
0	 he died an hour ago 
0	the old priest peter gilligan
0	in grief swayed to and fro 
0	 when you were gone he turned and died
0	 as merry as a bird 
0	the old priest peter gilligan
0	he knelt him at that word 
0	 he who hath made the night of stars
0	 for souls who tire and bleed 
0	 sent one of his great angels down
0	 to help me in my need 
0	 he who is wrapped in purple robes 
0	 with planets in his care 
0	 had pity on the least of things
0	 asleep upon a chair 
0	beloved gaze in thine own heart 
0	the holy tree is growing there 
0	from joy the holy branches start 
0	and all the trembling flowers they bear 
0	the changing colours of its fruit
0	have dowered the stars with merry light 
0	the surety of its hidden root
0	has planted quiet in the night 
0	the shaking of its leafy head
0	has given the waves their melody 
0	and made my lips and music wed 
0	murmuring a wizard song for thee 
0	there through bewildered branches go
0	winged loves borne on in gentle strife 
0	tossing and tossing to and fro
0	the flaming circle of our life 
0	when looking on their shaken hair 
0	and dreaming how they dance and dart 
0	thine eyes grow full of tender care 
0	beloved gaze in thine own heart 
0	gaze no more in the bitter glass
0	the demons with their subtle guile 
0	lift up before us when they pass 
0	or only gaze a little while 
0	for there a fatal image grows 
0	with broken boughs and blackened leaves 
0	and roots half hidden under snows
0	driven by a storm that ever grieves 
0	for all things turn to barrenness
0	in the dim glass the demons hold 
0	the glass of outer weariness 
0	made when god slept in times of old 
0	there through the broken branches go
0	the ravens of unresting thought 
0	peering and flying to and fro
0	to see men s souls bartered and bought 
0	when they are heard upon the wind 
0	and when they shake their wings alas 
0	thy tender eyes grow all unkind 
0	gaze no more in the bitter glass 
0	 know that i would accounted be
0	true brother of that company 
0	who sang to sweeten ireland s wrong 
0	ballad and story rann and song 
0	nor be i any less of them 
0	because the red rose bordered hem
0	of her whose history began
0	before god made the angelic clan 
0	trails all about the written page 
0	for in the world s first blossoming age
0	the light fall of her flying feet
0	made ireland s heart begin to beat 
0	and still the starry candles flare
0	to help her light foot here and there 
0	and still the thoughts of ireland brood
0	upon her holy quietude 
0	 nor may i less be counted one
0	because to him who ponders well 
0	my rhymes more than their rhyming tell
0	of the dim wisdoms old and deep 
0	that god gives unto man in sleep 
0	for the elemental beings go
0	about my table to and fro 
0	in flood and fire and clay and wind 
0	they huddle from man s pondering mind 
0	yet he who treads in austere ways
0	may surely meet their ancient gaze 
0	man ever journeys on with them
0	after the red rose bordered hem 
0	ah faeries dancing under the moon 
0	a druid land a druid tune 
0	 while still i may i write for you
0	the love i lived the dream i knew 
0	from our birthday until we die 
0	is but the winking of an eye 
0	and we our singing and our love 
0	the mariners of night above 
0	and all the wizard things that go
0	about my table to and fro 
0	are passing on to where may be 
0	in truth s consuming ecstasy
0	no place for love and dream at all 
0	for god goes by with white foot fall 
0	i cast my heart into my rhymes 
0	that you in the dim coming times 
0	may know how my heart went with them
0	after the red rose bordered hem 
0	 o rose thou art sick 
0	 the scene is laid in the barony of kilmacowen in the county of
0	sligo and at a remote time 
0	through the trees and carries the eye far off into a vague 
0	because i bid her clean the pots for supper
0	she took that old book down out of the thatch 
0	she has been doubled over it ever since 
0	we should be deafened by her groans and moans
0	had she to work as some do father hart 
0	get up at dawn like me and mend and scour
0	or ride abroad in the boisterous night like you 
0	the pyx and blessed bread under your arm 
0	mother you are too cross 
0	you ve married her 
0	and fear to vex her and so take her part 
0	it is but right that youth should side with youth 
0	she quarrels with my wife a bit at times 
0	and is too deep just now in the old book 
0	but do not blame her greatly she will grow
0	as quiet as a puff ball in a tree
0	when but the moons of marriage dawn and die
0	for half a score of times 
0	their hearts are wild 
0	as be the hearts of birds till children come 
0	she would not mind the kettle milk the cow 
0	or even lay the knives and spread the cloth 
0	shawn this is half empty 
0	go bring up the best bottle that we have 
0	i never saw her read a book before 
0	what are you waiting for 
0	you must not shake it when you draw the cork 
0	it s precious wine so take your time about it 
0	 to priest shawn goes 
0	there was a spaniard wrecked at ocris head 
0	when i was young and i have still some bottles 
0	he cannot bear to hear her blamed the book
0	has lain up in the thatch these fifty years 
0	my father told me my grandfather wrote it 
0	and killed a heifer for the binding of it 
0	but supper s spread and we can talk and eat
0	it was little good he got out of the book 
0	because it filled his house with rambling fiddlers 
0	and rambling ballad makers and the like 
0	the griddle bread is there in front of you 
0	colleen what is the wonder in that book 
0	that you must leave the bread to cool had i
0	or had my father read or written books
0	there were no stocking stuffed with yellow guineas
0	to come when i am dead to shawn and you 
0	you should not fill your head with foolish dreams 
0	what are you reading 
0	a daughter of a king of ireland heard
0	a voice singing on a may eve like this 
0	and followed half awake and half asleep 
0	until she came into the land of faery 
0	where nobody gets old and godly and grave 
0	where nobody gets old and crafty and wise 
0	where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue 
0	and she is still there busied with a dance
0	deep in the dewy shadow of a wood 
0	or where stars walk upon a mountain top 
0	persuade the colleen to put down the book 
0	my grandfather would mutter just such things 
0	and he was no judge of a dog or a horse 
0	and any idle boy could blarney him 
0	just speak your mind 
0	put it away my colleen 
0	god spreads the heavens above us like great wings
0	and gives a little round of deeds and days 
0	and then come the wrecked angels and set snares 
0	and bait them with light hopes and heavy dreams 
0	until the heart is puffed with pride and goes
0	half shuddering and half joyous from god s peace 
0	and it was some wrecked angel blind with tears 
0	who flattered edane s heart with merry words 
0	my colleen i have seen some other girls
0	restless and ill at ease but years went by
0	and they grew like their neighbours and were glad
0	in minding children working at the churn 
0	and gossiping of weddings and of wakes 
0	for life moves out of a red flare of dreams
0	into a common light of common hours 
0	until old age bring the red flare again 
0	that s true but she s too young to know it s true 
0	she s old enough to know that it is wrong
0	to mope and idle 
0	i ve little blame for her 
0	she s dull when my big son is in the fields 
0	and that and maybe this good woman s tongue
0	have driven her to hide among her dreams
0	like children from the dark under the bed clothes 
0	she d never do a turn if i were silent 
0	and maybe it is natural upon may eve
0	to dream of the good people but tell me girl 
0	if you ve the branch of blessed quicken wood
0	that women hang upon the post of the door
0	that they may send good luck into the house 
0	remember they may steal new married brides
0	after the fall of twilight on may eve 
0	or what old women mutter at the fire
0	is but a pack of lies 
0	it may be truth 
0	we do not know the limit of those powers
0	god has permitted to the evil spirits
0	for some mysterious end you have done right to mary 
0	it s well to keep old innocent customs up 
0	i had no sooner hung it on the nail
0	before a child ran up out of the wind 
0	she has caught it in her hand and fondled it 
0	her face is pale as water before dawn 
0	whose child can this be 
0	no one s child at all 
0	she often dreams that some one has gone by 
0	when there was nothing but a puff of wind 
0	they have taken away the blessed quicken wood 
0	they will not bring good luck into the house 
0	yet i am glad that i was courteous to them 
0	for are not they likewise children of god 
0	colleen they are the children of the fiend 
0	and they have power until the end of time 
0	when god shall fight with them a great pitched battle
0	and hack them into pieces 
0	he will smile 
0	father perhaps and open his great door 
0	did but the lawless angels see that door
0	they would fall slain by everlasting peace 
0	and when such angels knock upon our doors 
0	who goes with them must drive through the same storm 
0	mary coming to table 
0	there s somebody out there that beckoned me
0	and raised her hand as though it held a cup 
0	and she was drinking from it so it may be
0	that she is thirsty 
0	 she takes milk from the table and carries it to the door 
0	that will be the child
0	that you would have it was no child at all 
0	and maybe father what he said was true 
0	for there is not another night in the year
0	so wicked as to night 
0	nothing can harm us
0	while the good father s underneath our roof 
0	a little queer old woman dressed in green 
0	the good people beg for milk and fire
0	upon may eve woe to the house that gives 
0	for they have power upon it for a year 
0	hush woman hush 
0	she s given milk away 
0	i knew she would bring evil on the house 
0	who was it 
0	both the tongue and face were strange 
0	some strangers came last week to clover hill 
0	she must be one of them 
0	i am afraid 
0	the cross will keep all evil from the house
0	while it hangs there 
0	come sit beside me colleen 
0	and put away your dreams of discontent 
0	for i would have you light up my last days 
0	like the good glow of the turf and when i die
0	you ll be the wealthiest hereabout for colleen 
0	i have a stocking full of yellow guineas
0	hidden away where nobody can find it 
0	you are the fool of every pretty face 
0	and i must spare and pinch that my son s wife
0	may have all kinds of ribbons for her head 
0	do not be cross she is a right good girl 
0	the butter is by your elbow father hart 
0	my colleen have not fate and time and change
0	done well for me and for old bridget there 
0	we have a hundred acres of good land 
0	and sit beside each other at the fire 
0	i have this reverend father for my friend 
0	i look upon your face and my son s face 
0	we ve put his plate by yours and here he comes 
0	and brings with him the only thing we have lacked 
0	abundance of good wine shawn comes in stir up the fire 
0	and put new turf upon it till it blaze 
0	to watch the turf smoke coiling from the fire 
0	and feel content and wisdom in your heart 
0	this is the best of life when we are young
0	we long to tread a way none trod before 
0	but find the excellent old way through love 
0	and through the care of children to the hour
0	for bidding fate and time and change goodbye 
0	what is it draws you to the chill o the wood 
0	there is a light among the stems of the trees
0	that makes one shiver 
0	a little queer old man
0	made me a sign to show he wanted fire
0	to light his pipe 
0	you ve given milk and fire
0	upon the unluckiest night of the year and brought 
0	for all you know evil upon the house 
0	before you married you were idle and fine
0	and went about with ribbons on your head 
0	and now no father i will speak my mind 
0	she is not a fitting wife for any man 
0	be quiet mother 
0	you are much too cross 
0	what do i care if i have given this house 
0	where i must hear all day a bitter tongue 
0	into the power of faeries 
0	you know well
0	how calling the good people by that name 
0	or talking of them over much at all 
0	may bring all kinds of evil on the house 
0	come faeries take me out of this dull house 
0	let me have all the freedom i have lost 
0	work when i will and idle when i will 
0	faeries come take me out of this dull world 
0	for i would ride with you upon the wind 
0	run on the top of the dishevelled tide 
0	and dance upon the mountains like a flame 
0	you cannot know the meaning of your words 
0	father i am right weary of four tongues 
0	a tongue that is too crafty and too wise 
0	a tongue that is too godly and too grave 
0	a tongue that is more bitter than the tide 
0	and a kind tongue too full of drowsy love 
0	of drowsy love and my captivity

0	would that the world were mine to give it you 
0	and not its quiet hearths alone but even
0	all that bewilderment of light and freedom 
0	if you would have it 
0	i would take the world
0	and break it into pieces in my hands
0	to see you smile watching it crumble away 
0	then i would mould a world of fire and dew 
0	with no one bitter grave or over wise 
0	and nothing marred or old to do you wrong 
0	and crowd the enraptured quiet of the sky
0	with candles burning to your lonely face 
0	your looks are all the candles that i need 
0	once a fly dancing in a beam of the sun 
0	or the light wind blowing out of the dawn

0	while the faeries dance in a place apart 
0	shaking their milk white feet in a ring 
0	tossing their milk white arms in the air 
0	for they hear the wind laugh and murmur and sing
0	of a land where even the old are fair 
0	and even the wise are merry of tongue 
0	but i heard a reed of coolaney say 
0	 when the wind has laughed and murmured and sung

0	being happy i would have all others happy 
0	so i will bring her in out of the cold

0	you work your fingers to the bone old mother 
0	the young may lie in bed and dream and hope

0	the wind blows over the lonely of heart 
0	and the lonely of heart is withered away 
0	just now when she came near i thought i heard
0	other small steps beating upon the floor 
0	and a faint music blowing in the wind 
0	invisible pipes giving her feet the tune 
0	i heard no steps but hers 
0	i hear them now 
0	the unholy powers are dancing in the house

0	some dreadful thing will happen a while ago
0	she took away the blessed quicken wood 
0	you fear because of her unmeasured prattle

0	cry daughter to the angels and the saints 
0	you shall go with me newly married bride 
0	and gaze upon a merrier multitude 
0	white armed nuala aengus of the birds 
0	feacra of the hurtling foam and him

0	you re crouching there and shivering at the grave 
0	daughter i point you out the way to heaven 
0	but i can lead you newly married bride 
0	where nobody gets old and crafty and wise 
0	where nobody gets old and godly and grave 
0	where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue 
0	and where kind tongues bring no captivity

0	that drift into the mind at a wink of the eye 
0	by the dear name of the one crucified 
0	i bid you mary bruin come to me

0	i hear them sing come newly married bride 
0	come to the woods and waters and pale lights 
0	i will go with you 
0	she is lost alas 
0	the child standing by the door 
0	but clinging mortal hope must fall from you 
0	for we who ride the winds run on the waves 
0	and dance upon the mountains are more light
0	than dewdrops on the banner of the dawn 
0	o take me with you 
0	beloved i will keep you 
0	i ve more than words i have these arms to hold you 
0	nor all the faery host do what they please

0	i always loved her world and yet and yet 
0	white bird white bird come with me little bird 
0	she calls me 
0	come with me little bird 
0	 distant dancing figures appear in the wood 
0	i can hear songs and dancing 
0	stay with me 
0	i think that i would stay and yet and yet 
0	come little bird with crest of gold 
0	mary very softly 
0	come little bird with silver feet 
0	 mary bruin dies and the child goes 
0	she is dead 
0	come from that image body and soul are gone 
0	you have thrown your arms about a drift of leaves 
0	or bole of an ash tree changed into her image 
0	thus do the spirits of evil snatch their prey 
0	almost out of the very hand of god 
0	and day by day their power is more and more 
0	and men and women leave old paths for pride
0	comes knocking with thin knuckles on the heart 
0	 the wind blows out of the gates of the day 
0	the wind blows over the lonely of heart 
0	and the lonely of heart is withered away 
0	while the faeries dance in a place apart 
0	shaking their milk white feet in a ring 
0	tossing their milk white arms in the air 
0	for they hear the wind laugh and murmur and sing
0	of a land where even the old are fair 
0	and even the wise are merry of tongue 
0	but i heard a reed of coolaney say 
0	 when the wind has laughed and murmured and sung 
0	the lonely of heart is withered away 
0	the woods of arcady are dead 
0	and over is their antique joy 
0	of old the world on dreaming fed 
0	gray truth is now her painted toy 
0	yet still she turns her restless head 
0	but o sick children of the world 
0	of all the many changing things
0	in dreary dancing past us whirled 
0	to the cracked tune that chronos sings 
0	words alone are certain good 
0	where are now the warring kings 
0	word be mockers by the rood
0	where are now the warring kings 
0	an idle word is now their glory 
0	by the stammering schoolboy said 
0	reading some entangled story 
0	the kings of the old time are fled
0	the wandering earth herself may be
0	only a sudden flaming word 
0	in clanging space a moment heard 
0	troubling the endless reverie 
0	then nowise worship dusty deeds 
0	nor seek for this is also sooth 
0	to hunger fiercely after truth 
0	lest all thy toiling only breeds
0	new dreams new dreams there is no truth
0	saving in thine own heart seek then 
0	no learning from the starry men 
0	who follow with the optic glass
0	the whirling ways of stars that pass 
0	seek then for this is also sooth 
0	no word of theirs the cold star bane
0	has cloven and rent their hearts in twain 
0	and dead is all their human truth 
0	go gather by the humming sea
0	some twisted echo harbouring shell 
0	and to its lips thy story tell 
0	and they thy comforters will be 
0	rewarding in melodious guile 
0	thy fretful words a little while 
0	till they shall singing fade in ruth 
0	and die a pearly brotherhood 
0	for words alone are certain good 
0	sing then for this is also sooth 
0	i must be gone there is a grave
0	where daffodil and lily wave 
0	and i would please the hapless faun 
0	buried under the sleepy ground 
0	with mirthful songs before the dawn 
0	his shouting days with mirth were crowned 
0	and still i dream he treads the lawn 
0	walking ghostly in the dew 
0	pierced by my glad singing through 
0	my songs of old earth s dreamy youth 
0	but ah she dreams not now dream thou 
0	for fair are poppies on the brow 
0	dream dream for this is also sooth 
0	there was a man whom sorrow named his friend 
0	and he of his high comrade sorrow dreaming 
0	went walking with slow steps along the gleaming
0	and humming sands where windy surges wend 
0	and he called loudly to the stars to bend
0	from their pale thrones and comfort him but they
0	among themselves laugh on and sing alway 
0	and then the man whom sorrow named his friend
0	cried out dim sea hear my most piteous story 
0	the sea swept on and cried her old cry still 
0	rolling along in dreams from hill to hill 
0	he fled the persecution of her glory
0	and in a far off gentle valley stopping 
0	cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening 
0	but naught they heard for they are always listening 
0	the dewdrops for the sound of their own dropping 
0	and then the man whom sorrow named his friend 
0	sought once again the shore and found a shell 
0	and thought i will my heavy story tell
0	till my own words re echoing shall send
0	their sadness through a hollow pearly heart 
0	and my own tale again for me shall sing 
0	and my own whispering words be comforting 
0	and lo my ancient burden may depart 
0	then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim 
0	but the sad dweller by the sea ways lone
0	changed all he sang to inarticulate moan
0	among her wildering whirls forgetting him 
0	 what do you make so fair and bright 
0	 i make the cloak of sorrow 
0	 o lovely to see in all men s sight
0	 shall be the cloak of sorrow 
0	 in all men s sight 
0	 what do you build with sails for flight 
0	 i build a boat for sorrow 
0	 o swift on the seas all day and night
0	 saileth the rover sorrow 
0	 all day and night 
0	 what do you weave with wool so white 
0	 i weave the shoes of sorrow 
0	 soundless shall be the footfall light
0	 in all men s ears of sorrow 
0	 sudden and light 
0	 a little indian temple in the golden age around it a garden 
0	around that the forest anashuya the young priestess kneeling
0	send peace on all the lands and flickering corn 
0	o may tranquillity walk by his elbow
0	when wandering in the forest if he love
0	no other hear and may the indolent flocks
0	be plentiful and if he love another 
0	may panthers end him hear and load our king
0	with wisdom hour by hour may we two stand 
0	when we are dead beyond the setting suns 
0	a little from the other shades apart

0	to mighty brahma he who made you many as the sands 
0	and laid you on the gates of evening with his quiet hands 
0	vijaya i have brought my evening rice 
0	the sun has laid his chin on the gray wood 
0	weary with all his poppies gathered round him 
0	the hour when kama full of sleepy laughter 
0	rises and showers abroad his fragrant arrows 
0	piercing the twilight with their murmuring barbs 
0	see how the sacred old flamingoes come 
0	painting with shadow all the marble steps 
0	aged and wise they seek their wonted perches
0	within the temple devious walking made
0	to wander by their melancholy minds 
0	yon tall one eyes my supper swiftly chase him
0	far far away i named him after you 
0	he is a famous fisher hour by hour
0	he ruffles with his bill the minnowed streams 
0	ah there he snaps my rice i told you so 
0	now cuff him off he s off a kiss for you 
0	because you saved my rice have you no thanks 
0	 sing you of her o first few stars 
0	whom brahma touching with his finger praises for you hold 
0	 the van of wandering quiet ere you be too calm and old 
0	sing turning in your cars 
0	what know the pilots of the stars of tears 
0	their faces are all worn and in their eyes
0	flashes the fire of sadness for they see
0	the icicles that famish all the north 
0	where men lie frozen in the glimmering snow 
0	and in the flaming forests cower the lion
0	and lioness with all their whimpering cubs 
0	and ever pacing on the verge of things 
0	the phantom beauty in a mist of tears 
0	while we alone have round us woven woods 
0	and feel the softness of each other s hand 
0	anashuya going away from him 
0	ah me you love another 
0	and may some dreadful ill befall her quick 
0	i loved another now i love no other 
0	among the mouldering of ancient woods
0	you live and on the village border she 
0	with her old father the blind wood cutter 
0	i saw her standing in her door but now 
0	vijaya swear to love her never more 
0	swear by the parents of the gods 
0	dread oath who dwell on sacred himalay 
0	on the far golden peak enormous shapes 
0	who still were old when the great sea was young
0	on their vast faces mystery and dreams 
0	their hair along the mountains rolled and filled
0	from year to year by the unnumbered nests
0	of aweless birds and round their stirless feet
0	the joyous flocks of deer and antelope 
0	who never hear the unforgiving hound 
0	by the parents of the gods i swear 
0	anashuya sings 
0	 i have forgiven o new star 
0	maybe you have not heard of us you have come forth so newly 
0	you hunter of the fields afar 
0	ah you will know my loved one by his hunter s arrows truly 
0	shoot on him shafts of quietness that he may ever keep
0	an inner laughter and may kiss his hands to me in sleep 
0	farewell vijaya nay no word no word 
0	i priestess of this temple offer up
0	prayers for the land 
0	o brahma guard in sleep
0	the merry lambs and the complacent kine 
0	the flies below the leaves and the young mice
0	in the tree roots and all the sacred flocks
0	of red flamingo and my love vijaya 
0	and may no restless fay with fidget finger
0	trouble his sleeping give him dreams of me 
0	i passed along the water s edge below the humid trees 
0	my spirit rocked in evening light the rushes round my knees 
0	my spirit rocked in sleep and sighs and saw the moorfowl pace
0	all dripping on a grassy slope and saw them cease to chase
0	each other round in circles and heard the eldest speak 
0	 who holds the world between his bill and made us strong or weak
0	is an undying moorfowl and he lives beyond the sky 
0	 who made the world and ruleth it he hangeth on a stalk 
0	 for i am in his image made and all this tinkling tide
0	is but a sliding drop of rain between his petals wide 
0	a little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes
0	brimful of starlight and he said the stamper of the skies 
0	he is a gentle roebuck for how else i pray could he
0	conceive a thing so sad and soft a gentle thing like me 
0	i passed a little further on and heard a peacock say 
0	 who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay 
0	he is a monstrous peacock and he waveth all the night
0	his languid tail above us lit with myriad spots of light 
0	the island dreams under the dawn
0	and great boughs drop tranquillity 
0	the peahens dance on a smooth lawn 
0	a parrot sways upon a tree 
0	raging at his own image in the enamelled sea 
0	here we will moor our lonely ship
0	and wander ever with woven hands 
0	murmuring softly lip to lip 
0	along the grass along the sands 
0	murmuring how far away are the unquiet lands 
0	how we alone of mortals are
0	hid under quiet bows apart 
0	while our love grows an indian star 
0	a meteor of the burning heart 
0	one with the tide that gleams the wings that gleam and dart 
0	the heavy boughs the burnished dove
0	that moans and sighs a hundred days 
0	how when we die our shades will rove 
0	when eve has hushed the feathered ways 
0	with vapoury footsole among the water s drowsy blaze 
0	autumn is over the long leaves that love us 
0	and over the mice in the barley sheaves 
0	yellow the leaves of the rowan above us 
0	and yellow the wet wild strawberry leaves 
0	the hour of the waning of love has beset us 
0	and weary and worn are our sad souls now 
0	let us part ere the season of passion forget us 
0	with a kiss and a tear on thy drooping brow 
0	 your eyes that once were never weary of mine
0	 are bowed in sorrow under pendulous lids 
0	 because our love is waning 
0	and then she 
0	 although our love is waning let us stand
0	 by the lone border of the lake once more 
0	 together in that hour of gentleness
0	 when the poor tired child passion falls asleep 
0	 how far away the stars seem and how far
0	 is our first kiss and ah how old my heart 
0	pensive they paced along the faded leaves 
0	while slowly he whose hand held hers replied 
0	 passion has often worn our wandering hearts 
0	the woods were round them and the yellow leaves
0	fell like faint meteors in the gloom and once
0	a rabbit old and lame limped down the path 
0	autumn was over him and now they stood
0	on the lone border of the lake once more 
0	turning he saw that she had thrust dead leaves
0	gathered in silence dewy as her eyes 
0	in bosom and hair 
0	 ah do not mourn he said 
0	 that we are tired for other loves await us 
0	 hate on and love through unrepining hours 
0	 before us lies eternity our souls
0	 are love and a continual farewell 
0	i sat on cushioned otter skin 
0	my word was law from ith to emen 
0	and shook at invar amargin
0	the hearts of the world troubling seamen 
0	and drove tumult and war away
0	from girl and boy and man and beast 
0	the fields grew fatter day by day 
0	the wild fowl of the air increased 
0	and every ancient ollave said 
0	while he bent down his fading head 
0	 he drives away the northern cold 
0	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
0	the beech leaves old 
0	i sat and mused and drank sweet wine 
0	a herdsman came from inland valleys 
0	crying the pirates drove his swine
0	to fill their dark beaked hollow galleys 
0	i called my battle breaking men 
0	and my loud brazen battle cars
0	from rolling vale and rivery glen 
0	and under the blinking of the stars
0	fell on the pirates by the deep 
0	and hurled them in the gulph of sleep 
0	these hands won many a torque of gold 
0	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
0	the beech leaves old 
0	but slowly as i shouting slew
0	and trampled in the bubbling mire 
0	in my most secret spirit grew
0	a whirling and a wandering fire 
0	i stood keen stars above me shone 
0	around me shone keen eyes of men 
0	i laughed aloud and hurried on
0	by rocky shore and rushy fen 
0	i laughed because birds fluttered by 
0	and starlight gleamed and clouds flew high 
0	and rushes waved and waters rolled 
0	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
0	the beech leaves old 
0	and now i wander in the woods
0	when summer gluts the golden bees 
0	or in autumnal solitudes
0	arise the leopard coloured trees 
0	or when along the wintry strands
0	the cormorants shiver on their rocks 
0	i wander on and wave my hands 
0	and sing and shake my heavy locks 
0	the gray wolf knows me by one ear
0	i lead along the woodland deer 
0	the hares run by me growing bold 
0	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
0	the beech leaves old 
0	i came upon a little town 
0	that slumbered in the harvest moon 
0	and passed a tiptoe up and down 
0	murmuring to a fitful tune 
0	how i have followed night and day 
0	a tramping of tremendous feet 
0	and saw where this old tympan lay 
0	deserted on a doorway seat 
0	and bore it to the woods with me 
0	of some unhuman misery
0	our married voiced wildly trolled 
0	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
0	the beech leaves old 
0	i sang how when day s toil is done 
0	orchil shakes out her long dark hair
0	that hides away the dying sun
0	and sheds faint odours through the air 
0	when my hand passed from wire to wire
0	it quenched with sound like falling dew 
0	the whirling and the wandering fire 
0	but lift a mournful ulalu 
0	for the kind wires are torn and still 
0	and i must wander wood and hill
0	through summer s heat and winter s cold 
0	 they will not hush the leaves a flutter round me 
0	the beech leaves old 
0	where dips the rocky highland
0	of sleuth wood in the lake 
0	there lies a leafy island
0	where flapping herons wake
0	the drowsy water rats 
0	there we ve hid our faery vats 
0	full of berries 
0	and of reddest stolen cherries 
0	 come away o human child 
0	to the waters and the wild
0	with a faery hand in hand 
0	for the world s more full of weeping than you can understand 
0	where the wave of moonlight glosses
0	the dim gray sands with light 
0	far off by furthest rosses
0	we foot it all the night 
0	weaving olden dances 
0	mingling hands and mingling glances
0	till the moon has taken flight 
0	to and fro we leap
0	and chase the frothy bubbles 
0	while the world is full of troubles
0	and is anxious in its sleep 
0	 come away o human child 
0	to the waters and the wild
0	with a faery hand in hand 
0	for the world s more full of weeping than you can understand 
0	where the wandering water gushes
0	from the hills above glen car 
0	in pools among the rushes
0	that scarce could bathe a star 
0	we seek for slumbering trout
0	and whispering in their ears
0	give them unquiet dreams 
0	leaning softly out
0	from ferns that drop their tears
0	over the young streams 
0	 come away o human child 
0	to the waters and the wild
0	with a faery hand in hand 
0	for the world s more full of weeping than you can understand 
0	away with us he s going 
0	the solemn eyed 
0	he ll hear no more the lowing
0	of the calves on the warm hillside
0	or the kettle on the hob
0	sing peace into his breast 
0	or see the brown mice bob
0	round and round the oatmeal chest 
0	 for he comes the human child 
0	to the waters and the wild
0	with a faery hand in hand 
0	from a world more full of weeping than he can understand 
0	shy one shy one 
0	shy one of my heart 
0	she moves in the firelight
0	pensively apart 
0	she carries in the dishes 
0	and lays them in a row 
0	to an isle in the water
0	with her would i go 
0	she carries in the candles 
0	and lights the curtained room 
0	shy in the doorway
0	and shy in the gloom 
0	and shy as a rabbit 
0	helpful and shy 
0	to an isle in the water
0	with her would i fly 
0	down by the salley gardens my love and i did meet 
0	she passed the salley gardens with little snow white feet 
0	she bid me take love easy as the leaves grow on the tree 
0	but i being young and foolish with her would not agree 
0	in a field by the river my love and i did stand 
0	and on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow white hand 
0	she bid me take life easy as the grass grows on the weirs 
0	but i was young and foolish and now am full of tears 
0	you waves though you dance by my feet like children at play 
0	though you glow and you glance though you purr and you dart 
0	the herring are not in the tides as they were of old 
0	my sorrow for many a creak gave the creel in the cart
0	that carried the take to sligo town to be sold 
0	 when i was a boy with never a crack in my heart 
0	and ah you proud maiden you are not so fair when his oar
0	is heard on the water as they were the proud and apart 
0	who paced in the eve by the nets on the pebbly shore 
0	 when i was a boy with never a crack in my heart 
0	in penal days rode out
0	to a shoneen who had free lands
0	and his own snipe and trout 
0	in trust took he john s lands 
0	sleiveens were all his race 
0	and he gave them as dowers to his daughters 
0	and they married beyond their place 
0	but father john went up 
0	and father john went down 
0	and he wore small holes in his shoes 
0	and he wore large holes in his gown 
0	all loved him only the shoneen 
0	whom the devils have by the hair 
0	from the wives and the cats and the children 
0	to the birds in the white of the air 
0	the birds for he opened their cages
0	as he went up and down 
0	and he said with a smile have peace now 
0	and he went his way with a frown 
0	but if when any one died
0	came keeners hoarser than rooks 
0	he bade them give over their keening 
0	for he was a man of books 
0	and these were the works of john 
0	when weeping score by score 
0	people came into coloony 
0	for he d died at ninety four 
0	there was no human keening 
0	the birds from knocknarea
0	and the world round knocknashee
0	came keening in that day 
0	the young birds and old birds
0	came flying heavy and sad 
0	keening in from tiraragh 
0	keening from ballinafad 
0	keening from inishmurray 
0	nor stayed for bite or sup 
0	this way were all reproved
0	who dig old customs up 
0	come round me little childer 
0	there don t fling stones at me
0	because i mutter as i go 
0	but pity moll magee 
0	my man was a poor fisher
0	with shore lines in the say 
0	my work was saltin herrings
0	the whole of the long day 
0	and sometimes from the saltin shed 
0	i scarce could drag my feet
0	under the blessed moonlight 
0	along the pebbly street 
0	i d always been but weakly 
0	and my baby was just born 
0	a neighbour minded her by day
0	i minded her till morn 
0	i lay upon my baby 
0	ye little childer dear 
0	i looked on my cold baby
0	when the morn grew frosty and clear 
0	a weary woman sleeps so hard 
0	my man grew red and pale 
0	and gave me money and bade me go
0	to my own place kinsale 
0	he drove me out and shut the door 
0	and gave his curse to me 
0	i went away in silence 
0	no neighbour could i see 
0	the windows and the doors were shut 
0	one star shone faint and green
0	the little straws were turnin round
0	across the bare boreen 
0	i went away in silence 
0	beyond old martin s byre
0	i saw a kindly neighbour
0	blowin her mornin fire 
0	she drew from me my story 
0	my money s all used up 
0	and still with pityin scornin eye 
0	she gives me bite and sup 
0	she says my man will surely come 
0	and fetch me home agin 
0	but always as i m movin round 
0	without doors or within 
0	pilin the wood or pilin the turf 
0	or goin to the well 
0	i m thinkin of my baby
0	and keenin to mysel 
0	and sometimes i am sure she knows
0	when openin wide his door 
0	god lights the stars his candles 
0	and looks upon the poor 
0	so now ye little childer 
0	ye won t fling stones at me 
0	but gather with your shinin looks
0	and pity moll magee 
0	 now lay me in a cushioned chair
0	 and carry me you four 
0	 with cushions here and cushions there 
0	 to see the world once more 
0	 and some one from the stables bring
0	 my dermot dear and brown 
0	 and lead him gently in a ring 
0	 and gently up and down 
0	 now leave the chair upon the grass 
0	 bring hound and huntsman here 
0	 and i on this strange road will pass 
0	 filled full of ancient cheer 
0	his eyelids droop his head falls low 
0	his old eyes cloud with dreams 
0	the sun upon all things that grow
0	pours round in sleepy streams 
0	brown dermot treads upon the lawn 
0	and to the armchair goes 
0	and now the old man s dreams are gone 
0	he smooths the long brown nose 
0	and now moves many a pleasant tongue
0	upon his wasted hands 
0	for leading aged hounds and young
0	the huntsman near him stands 
0	 my huntsman rody blow the horn 
0	 and make the hills reply 
0	the huntsman loosens on the morn
0	a gay and wandering cry 
0	a fire is in the old man s eyes 
0	his fingers move and sway 
0	and when the wandering music dies
0	they hear him feebly say 
0	 my huntsman rody blow the horn 
0	 and make the hills reply 
0	 i cannot blow upon my horn 
0	 i can but weep and sigh 
0	the servants round his cushioned place
0	are with new sorrow wrung 
0	and hounds are gazing on his face 
0	both aged hounds and young 
0	one blind hound only lies apart
0	on the sun smitten grass 
0	he holds deep commune with his heart 
0	the moments pass and pass 
0	the blind hound with a mournful din
0	lifts slow his wintry head 
0	the servants bear the body in 
0	the hounds wail for the dead 
0	 give me the world if thou wilt but grant me an asylum for my
0	affections 
0	you who are bent and bald and blind 
0	with a heavy heart and a wandering mind 
0	have known three centuries poets sing 
0	of dalliance with a demon thing 
0	sad to remember sick with years 
0	the swift innumerable spears 
0	the horsemen with their floating hair 
0	and bowls of barley honey and wine 
0	and feet of maidens dancing in tune 
0	and the white body that lay by mine 
0	but the tale though words be lighter than air 
0	must live to be old like the wandering moon 
0	caolte and conan and finn were there 
0	when we followed a deer with our baying hounds 
0	and passing the firbolgs burial mounds 
0	came to the cairn heaped grassy hill
0	where passionate maive is stony still 
0	and found on the dove gray edge of the sea
0	a pearl pale high born lady who rode
0	on a horse with bridle of findrinny 
0	and like a sunset were her lips 
0	a stormy sunset on doomed ships 
0	a citron colour gloomed in her hair 
0	but down to her feet white vesture flowed 
0	and with the glimmering crimson glowed
0	of many a figured embroidery 
0	and it was bound with a pearl pale shell
0	that wavered like the summer streams 
0	as her soft bosom rose and fell 
0	you are still wrecked among heathen dreams 
0	 why do you wind no horn she said 
0	 and every hero droop his head 
0	 the hornless deer is not more sad
0	 that many a peaceful moment had 
0	 more sleek than any granary mouse 
0	 in his own leafy forest house
0	 among the waving fields of fern 
0	 the hunting of heroes should be glad 
0	 o pleasant woman answered finn 
0	 we think on oscar s pencilled urn 
0	 and on the heroes lying slain 
0	on gavra s raven covered plain 
0	 but where are your noble kith and kin 
0	 and from what country do you ride 
0	 my father and my mother are
0	 aengus and adene my own name
0	 niam and my country far
0	 beyond the tumbling of this tide 
0	 what dream came with you that you came
0	 through bitter tide on foam wet feet 
0	 did your companion wander away
0	 from where the birds of aengus wing 
0	she said with laughter tender and sweet 
0	 i have not yet war weary king 
0	 been spoken of with any one 
0	 yet now i choose for these four feet
0	 ran through the foam and ran to this
0	 that i might have your son to kiss 
0	 were there no better than my son
0	 that you through all that foam should run 
0	 i loved no man though kings besought
0	 love till the danaan poets brought
0	 rhyme that rhymed to usheen s name 
0	 and now i am dizzy with the thought
0	 of all that wisdom and the fame
0	 of battles broken by his hands 
0	 of stories builded by his words
0	 that are like coloured asian birds
0	 at evening in their rainless lands 
0	o patric by your brazen bell 
0	there was no limb of mine but fell
0	into a desperate gulph of love 
0	 you only will i wed i cried 
0	 and i will make a thousand songs 
0	 and set your name all names above 
0	 and captives bound with leathern thongs
0	 shall kneel and praise you one by one 
0	 at evening in my western dun 
0	 o usheen mount by me and ride
0	 to shores by the wash of the tremulous tide 
0	 where men have heaped no burial mounds 
0	 and the days pass by like a wayward tune 
0	 where broken faith has never been known 
0	 and the blushes of first love never have flown 
0	 and there i will give you a hundred hounds 
0	 no mightier creatures bay at the moon 
0	 and a hundred robes of murmuring silk 
0	 and a hundred calves and a hundred sheep
0	 whose long wool whiter than sea froth flows 
0	 and a hundred spears and a hundred bows 
0	 and oil and wine and honey and milk 
0	 and always never anxious sleep 
0	 while a hundred youths mighty of limb 
0	 but knowing nor tumult nor hate nor strife 
0	 and a hundred maidens merry as birds 
0	 who when they dance to a fitful measure
0	 have a speed like the speed of the salmon herds 
0	 shall follow your horn and obey your whim 
0	 and you shall know the danaan leisure 
0	 and niam be with you for a wife 
0	then she sighed gently it grows late 
0	 music and love and sleep await 
0	 where i would be when the white moon climbs
0	 the red sun falls and the world grows dim 
0	and then i mounted and she bound me
0	with her triumphing arms around me 
0	and whispering to herself enwound me 
0	but when the horse had felt my weight 
0	he shook himself and neighed three times 
0	caolte conan and finn came near 
0	and wept and raised their lamenting hands 
0	and bid me stay with many a tear 
0	but we rode out from the human lands 
0	in what far kingdom do you go 
0	ah fenians with the shield and bow 
0	or are you phantoms white as snow 
0	whose lips had life s most prosperous glow 
0	o you with whom in sloping valleys 
0	or down the dewy forest alleys 
0	i chased at morn the flying deer 
0	with whom i hurled the hurrying spear 
0	and heard the foemen s bucklers rattle 
0	and broke the heaving ranks of battle 
0	where are you with your long rough hair 
0	you go not where the red deer feeds 
0	nor tear the foemen from their steeds 
0	boast not nor mourn with drooping head
0	companions long accurst and dead 
0	and hounds for centuries dust and air 
0	we galloped over the glossy sea 
0	i know not if days passed or hours 
0	and niam sang continually
0	danaan songs and their dewy showers
0	of pensive laughter unhuman sound 
0	lulled weariness and softly round
0	my human sorrow her white arms wound 
0	we galloped now a hornless deer
0	passed by us chased by a phantom hound
0	all pearly white save one red ear 
0	and now a maiden rode like the wind
0	with an apple of gold in her tossing hand 
0	and a beautiful young man followed behind
0	with quenchless gaze and fluttering hair 
0	 were these two born in the danaan land 
0	 or have they breathed the mortal air 
0	 vex them no longer niam said 
0	and sighing bowed her gentle head 
0	and sighing laid the pearly tip
0	of one long finger on my lip 
0	but now the moon like a white rose shone
0	in the pale west and the sun s rim sank 
0	and clouds arrayed their rank on rank
0	about his fading crimson ball 
0	the floor of emen s hosting hall
0	was not more level than the sea 
0	as full of loving phantasy 
0	and with low murmurs we rode on 
0	where many a trumpet twisted shell
0	that in immortal silence sleeps
0	dreaming of her own melting hues 
0	her golds her ambers and her blues 
0	pierced with soft light the shallowing deeps 
0	but now a wandering land breeze came
0	and a far sound of feathery quires 
0	it seemed to blow from the dying flame 
0	they seemed to sing in the smouldering fires 
0	the horse towards the music raced 
0	neighing along the lifeless waste 
0	like sooty fingers many a tree
0	rose ever out of the warm sea 
0	and they were trembling ceaselessly 
0	as though they all were beating time 
0	upon the centre of the sun 
0	to that low laughing woodland rhyme 
0	and now our wandering hours were done 
0	we cantered to the shore and knew
0	the reason of the trembling trees 
0	round every branch the song birds flew 
0	or clung thereon like swarming bees 
0	while round the shore a million stood
0	like drops of frozen rainbow light 
0	and pondered in a soft vain mood
0	upon their shadows in the tide 
0	and told the purple deeps their pride 
0	and murmured snatches of delight 
0	and on the shores were many boats
0	with bending sterns and bending bows 
0	and carven figures on their prows
0	of bitterns and fish eating stoats 
0	and swans with their exultant throats 
0	and where the wood and waters meet
0	we tied the horse in a leafy clump 
0	and niam blew three merry notes
0	out of a little silver trump 
0	and then an answering whispering flew
0	over the bare and woody land 
0	a whisper of impetuous feet 
0	and ever nearer nearer grew 
0	and from the woods rushed out a band
0	of men and maidens hand in hand 
0	and singing singing altogether 
0	their brows were white as fragrant milk 
0	their cloaks made out of yellow silk 
0	and trimmed with many a crimson feather 
0	and when they saw the cloak i wore
0	was dim with mire of a mortal shore 
0	they fingered it and gazed on me
0	and laughed like murmurs of the sea 
0	but niam with a swift distress
0	bid them away and hold their peace 
0	and when they heard her voice they ran
0	and knelt them every maid and man
0	and kissed as they would never cease 
0	her pearl pale hand and the hem of her dress 
0	she bade them bring us to the hall
0	where aengus dreams from sun to sun 
0	a druid dream of the end of days
0	when the stars are to wane and the world be done 
0	they led us by long and shadowy ways
0	where drops of dew in myriads fall 
0	and tangled creepers every hour
0	blossom in some new crimson flower 
0	and once a sudden laughter sprang
0	from all their lips and once they sang
0	together while the dark woods rang 
0	and made in all their distant parts 
0	with boom of bees in honey marts 
0	a rumour of delighted hearts 
0	and once a maiden by my side
0	gave me a harp and bid me sing 
0	and touch the laughing silver string 
0	but when i sang of human joy
0	a sorrow wrapped each merry face 
0	and patric by your beard they wept 
0	until one came a tearful boy 
0	 a sadder creature never stept
0	 than this strange human bard he cried 
0	and caught the silver harp away 
0	and weeping over the white strings hurled
0	it down in a leaf hid hollow place
0	that kept dim waters from the sky 
0	and each one said with a long long sigh 
0	 o saddest harp in all the world 
0	 sleep there till the moon and the stars die 
0	and now still sad we came to where
0	a beautiful young man dreamed within
0	a house of wattles clay and skin 
0	one hand upheld his beardless chin 
0	and one a sceptre flashing out
0	wild flames of red and gold and blue 
0	like to a merry wandering rout
0	of dancers leaping in the air 
0	and men and maidens knelt them there
0	and showed their eyes with teardrops dim 
0	and with low murmurs prayed to him 
0	and kissed the sceptre with red lips 
0	and touched it with their finger tips 
0	he held that flashing sceptre up 
0	 joy drowns the twilight in the dew 
0	 and fills with stars night s purple cup 
0	 and wakes the sluggard seeds of corn 
0	 and stirs the young kid s budding horn 
0	 and makes the infant ferns unwrap 
0	 and for the peewit paints his cap 
0	 and rolls along the unwieldy sun 
0	 and makes the little planets run 
0	 and if joy were not on the earth 
0	 there were an end of change and birth 
0	 and earth and heaven and hell would die 
0	 and in some gloomy barrow lie
0	 folded like a frozen fly 
0	 then mock at death and time with glances
0	 and wavering arms and wandering dances 
0	 men s hearts of old were drops of flame
0	 that from the saffron morning came 
0	 or drops of silver joy that fell
0	 out of the moon s pale twisted shell 
0	 but now hearts cry that hearts are slaves 
0	 and toss and turn in narrow caves 
0	 but here there is nor law nor rule 
0	 nor have hands held a weary tool 
0	 and here there is nor change nor death 
0	 but only kind and merry breath 
0	 for joy is god and god is joy 
0	with one long glance on maid and boy
0	and the pale blossom of the moon 
0	he fell into a druid swoon 
0	and in a wild and sudden dance
0	we mocked at time and fate and chance
0	and swept out of the wattled hall
0	and came to where the dewdrops fall
0	among the foamdrops of the sea 
0	and there we hushed the revelry 
0	and gathering on our brows a frown 
0	bent all our swaying bodies down 
0	and to the waves that glimmer by
0	that sloping green de danaan sod
0	 and things that have grown sad are wicked 
0	 and things that fear the dawn of the morrow
0	 or the gray wandering osprey sorrow 
0	we danced to where in the winding thicket
0	the damask roses bloom on bloom 
0	like crimson meteors hang in the gloom 
0	and bending over them softly said 
0	bending over them in the dance 
0	with a swift and friendly glance
0	from dewy eyes upon the dead
0	 fall the leaves of other roses 
0	 on the dead dim earth encloses 
0	 but never never on our graves 
0	 heaped beside the glimmering waves 
0	 shall fall the leaves of damask roses 
0	 for neither death nor change comes near us 
0	 and all listless hours fear us 
0	 and we fear no dawning morrow 
0	 nor the gray wandering osprey sorrow 
0	the dance wound through the windless woods 
0	the ever summered solitudes 
0	until the tossing arms grew still
0	upon the woody central hill 
0	and gathered in a panting band 
0	we flung on high each waving hand 
0	and sang unto the starry broods 
0	in our raised eyes there flashed a glow
0	of milky brightness to and fro
0	as thus our song arose you stars 
0	 across your wandering ruby cars
0	 shake the loose reins you slaves of god
0	 he rules you with an iron rod 
0	 he holds you with an iron bond 
0	 each one woven to the other 
0	 each one woven to his brother
0	 like bubbles in a frozen pond 
0	 but we in a lonely land abide
0	 unchainable as the dim tide 
0	 with hearts that know nor law nor rule 
0	 and hands that hold no wearisome tool
0	 folded in love that fears no morrow 
0	 nor the gray wandering osprey sorrow 
0	o patric for a hundred years
0	i chased upon that woody shore
0	the deer the badger and the boar 
0	o patric for a hundred years
0	at evening on the glimmering sands 
0	beside the piled up hunting spears 
0	these now outworn and withered hands
0	wrestled among the island bands 
0	o patric for a hundred years
0	we went a fishing in long boats
0	with bending sterns and bending bows 
0	and carven figures on their prows
0	of bitterns and fish eating stoats 
0	o patric for a hundred years
0	the gentle niam was my wife 
0	but now two things devour my life 
0	the things that most of all i hate 
0	fasting and prayers 
0	yes yes 
0	for these were ancient usheen s fate
0	loosed long ago from heaven s gate 
0	for his last days to lie in wait 
0	when one day by the tide i stood 
0	i found in that forgetfulness
0	of dreamy foam a staff of wood
0	from some dead warrior s broken lance 
0	i turned it in my hands the stains
0	of war were on it and i wept 
0	remembering how the fenians stept
0	along the blood bedabbled plains 
0	equal to good or grievous chance 
0	thereon young niam softly came
0	and caught my hands but spake no word
0	save only many times my name 
0	in murmurs like a frighted bird 
0	we passed by woods and lawns of clover 
0	and found the horse and bridled him 
0	for we knew well the old was over 
0	i heard one say his eyes grow dim
0	 with all the ancient sorrow of men 
0	and wrapped in dreams rode out again
0	with hoofs of the pale findrinny
0	over the glimmering purple sea 
0	under the golden evening light 
0	the immortals moved among the fountains
0	by rivers and the woods old night 
0	some danced like shadows on the mountains 
0	some wandered ever hand in hand 
0	or sat in dreams on the pale strand 
0	each forehead like an obscure star
0	bent down above each hooked knee 
0	and sang and with a dreamy gaze
0	watched where the sun in a saffron blaze
0	was slumbering half in the sea ways 
0	and as they sang the painted birds
0	kept time with their bright wings and feet 
0	like drops of honey came their words 
0	but fainter than a young lamb s bleat 
0	 an old man stirs the fire to a blaze 
0	 in the house of a child of a friend of a brother
0	 he has over lingered his welcome the days 
0	 grown desolate whisper and sigh to each other 
0	 he hears the storm in the chimney above 
0	 and bends to the fire and shakes with the cold 
0	 while his heart still dreams of battle and love 
0	 and the cry of the hounds on the hills of old 
0	 but we are apart in the grassy places 
0	 where care cannot trouble the least of our days 
0	 or the softness of youth be gone from our faces 
0	 or love s first tenderness die in our gaze 
0	 the hare grows old as she plays in the sun
0	 and gazes around her with eyes of brightness 
0	 before the swift things that she dreamed of were done
0	 she limps along in an aged whiteness 
0	 a storm of birds in the asian trees
0	 like tulips in the air a winging 
0	 and the gentle waves of the summer seas 
0	 that raise their heads and wander singing 
0	 must murmur at last unjust unjust 
0	 and my speed is a weariness falters the mouse
0	 and the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust 
0	 and the roof falls in of his tunnelled house 
0	 but the love dew dims our eyes till the day
0	 when god shall come from the sea with a sigh
0	 and bid the stars drop down from the sky 
0	 and the moon like a pale rose wither away 
0	now man of croziers shadows called our names
0	and then away away like whirling flames 
0	and now fled by mist covered without sound 
0	the youth and lady and the deer and hound 
0	 gaze no more on the phantoms niam said 
0	and kissed my eyes and swaying her bright head
0	and her bright body sang of faery and man
0	before god was or my old line began 
0	wars shadowy vast exultant faeries of old
0	who wedded men with rings of druid gold 
0	and how those lovers never turn their eyes
0	upon the life that fades and flickers and dies 
0	but love and kiss on dim shores far away
0	rolled round with music of the sighing spray 
0	but sang no more as when like a brown bee
0	that has drunk full she crossed the misty sea
0	with me in her white arms a hundred years
0	before this day for now the fall of tears
0	troubled her song 
0	i do not know if days
0	or hours passed by yet hold the morning rays
0	shone many times among the glimmering flowers
0	woven into her hair before dark towers
0	rose in the darkness and the white surf gleamed
0	about them and the horse of faery screamed
0	and shivered knowing the isle of many fears 
0	nor ceased until white niam stroked his ears
0	and named him by sweet names 
0	a foaming tide
0	whitened afar with surge fan formed and wide 
0	burst from a great door marred by many a blow
0	from mace and sword and pole axe long ago
0	when gods and giants warred we rode between
0	the seaweed covered pillars and the green
0	and surging phosphorus alone gave light
0	on our dark pathway till a countless flight
0	of moonlit steps glimmered and left and right
0	dark statues glimmered over the pale tide
0	upon dark thrones between the lids of one
0	the imaged meteors had flashed and run
0	and had disported in the stilly jet 
0	and the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set 
0	since god made time and death and sleep the other
0	stretched his long arm to where a misty smother 
0	the stream churned churned and churned his lips apart 
0	as though he told his never slumbering heart
0	of every foamdrop on its misty way 
0	tying the horse to his vast foot that lay
0	half in the unvesselled sea we climbed the stairs
0	and climbed so long i thought the last steps were
0	hung from the morning star when these mild words
0	fanned the delighted air like wings of birds 
0	 my brothers spring out of their beds at morn 
0	 a murmur like young partridge with loud horn
0	 they chase the noontide deer 
0	 and when the dew drowned stars hang in the air
0	 look to long fishing lines or point and pare
0	 an ash wood hunting spear 
0	 o sigh o fluttering sigh be kind to me 
0	 flutter along the froth lips of the sea 
0	 and shores the froth lips wet 
0	 and stay a little while and bid them weep 
0	 ah touch their blue veined eyelids if they sleep 
0	 and shake their coverlet 
0	 when you have told how i weep endlessly 
0	 flutter along the froth lips of the sea
0	 and home to me again 
0	 and in the shadow of my hair lie hid 
0	 and tell me how you came to one unbid 
0	 the saddest of all men 
0	a maiden with soft eyes like funeral tapers 
0	and face that seemed wrought out of moonlit vapours 
0	and a sad mouth that fear made tremulous
0	as any ruddy moth looked down on us 
0	and she with a wave rusted chain was tied
0	to two old eagles full of ancient pride 
0	that with dim eyeballs stood on either side 
0	few feathers were on their dishevelled wings 
0	for their dim minds were with the ancient things 
0	 i bring deliverance pearl pale niam said 
0	 neither the living nor the unlabouring dead 
0	 nor the high gods who never lived may fight
0	 my enemy and hope demons for fright
0	 jabber and scream about him in the night 
0	 for he is strong and crafty as the seas
0	 that sprang under the seven hazel trees 
0	 and i must needs endure and hate and weep 
0	 until the gods and demons drop asleep 
0	 hearing aed touch the mournful strings of gold 
0	 is he so dreadful 
0	 be not over bold 
0	 but flee while you may flee from him 
0	 this demon shall be pierced and drop and die 
0	 and his loose bulk be thrown in the loud tide 
0	 flee from him pearl pale niam weeping cried 
0	 for all men flee the demons but moved not
0	my angry king remembering soul one jot 
0	there was no mightier soul of heber s line 
0	now it is old and mouse like for a sign
0	i burst the chain still earless nerveless blind 
0	wrapped in the things of the unhuman mind 
0	in some dim memory or ancient mood
0	still earless nerveless blind the eagles stood 
0	and then we climbed the stair to a high door 
0	a hundred horsemen on the basalt floor
0	beneath had paced content we held our way
0	and stood within clothed in a misty ray
0	i saw a foam white seagull drift and float
0	under the roof and with a straining throat
0	shouted and hailed him he hung there a star 
0	for no man s cry shall ever mount so far 
0	not even your god could have thrown down that hall 
0	stabling his unloosed lightnings in their stall 
0	he had sat down and sighed with cumbered heart 
0	as though his hour were come 
0	we sought the part
0	that was most distant from the door green slime
0	made the way slippery and time on time
0	showed prints of sea born scales while down through it
0	the captive s journeys to and fro were writ
0	like a small river and where feet touched came
0	a momentary gleam of phosphorus flame 
0	under the deepest shadows of the hall
0	that maiden found a ring hung on the wall 
0	and in the ring a torch and with its flare
0	making a world about her in the air 
0	passed under a dim doorway out of sight
0	and came again holding a second light
0	burning between her fingers and in mine
0	laid it and sighed i held a sword whose shine
0	no centuries could dim and a word ran
0	thereon in ogham letters mananan 
0	that sea god s name who in a deep content
0	sprang dripping and with captive demons sent
0	out of the seven fold seas built the dark hall
0	rooted in foam and clouds and cried to all
0	the mightier masters of a mightier race 
0	and at his cry there came no milk pale face
0	under a crown of thorns and dark with blood 
0	but only exultant faces 
0	niam stood
0	with bowed head trembling when the white blade shone 
0	but she whose hours of tenderness were gone
0	had neither hope nor fear i bade them hide
0	under the shadows till the tumults died
0	of the loud crashing and earth shaking fight 
0	lest they should look upon some dreadful sight 
0	and thrust the torch between the slimy flags 
0	a dome made out of endless carven jags 
0	where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face 
0	looked down on me and in the self same place
0	i waited hour by hour and the high dome 
0	windowless pillarless multitudinous home
0	of faces waited and the leisured gaze
0	was loaded with the memory of days
0	buried and mighty when through the great door
0	the dawn came in and glimmered on the floor
0	with a pale light i journeyed round the hall
0	and found a door deep sunken in the wall 
0	the least of doors beyond on a dim plain
0	a little runnel made a bubbling strain 
0	and on the runnel s stony and bare edge
0	a husky demon dry as a withered sedge
0	swayed crooning to himself an unknown tongue 
0	in a sad revelry he sang and swung
0	bacchant and mournful passing to and fro
0	his hand along the runnel s side as though
0	the flowers still grew there far on the sea s waste
0	shaking and waving vapour vapour chased 
0	while high frail cloudlets fed with a green light 
0	like drifts of leaves immovable and bright 
0	hung in the passionate dawn he slowly turned 
0	a demon s leisure eyes first white now burned
0	like wings of kingfishers and he arose
0	barking we trampled up and down with blows
0	of sword and brazen battle axe while day
0	gave to high noon and noon to night gave way 
0	and when at withering of the sun he knew
0	the druid sword of mananan he grew
0	to many shapes i lunged at the smooth throat
0	of a great eel it changed and i but smote
0	a fir tree roaring in its leafless top 
0	i held a dripping corpse with livid chop
0	and sunken shape against my face and breast 
0	when i tore down the tree but when the west
0	surged up in plumy fire i lunged and drave
0	through heart and spine and cast him in the wave 
0	lest niam shudder 
0	full of hope and dread
0	those two came carrying wine and meat and bread 
0	and healed my wounds with unguents out of flowers
0	that feed white moths by some de danaan shrine 
0	then in that hall lit by the dim sea shine 
0	we lay on skins of otters and drank wine 
0	brewed by the sea gods from huge cups that lay
0	upon the lips of sea gods in their day 
0	and then on heaped up skins of otters slept 
0	but when the sun once more in saffron stept 
0	rolling his flagrant wheel out of the deep 
0	we sang the loves and angers without sleep 
0	and all the exultant labours of the strong 
0	but now the lying clerics murder song
0	with barren words and flatteries of the weak 
0	in what land do the powerless turn the beak
0	of ravening sorrow or the hand of wrath 
0	for all your croziers they have left the path
0	and wander in the storms and clinging snows 
0	hopeless for ever ancient usheen knows 
0	for he is weak and poor and blind and lies
0	on the anvil of the world 
0	be still the skies
0	are choked with thunder lightning and fierce wind 
0	for god has heard and speaks his angry mind 
0	go cast your body on the stones and pray 
0	for he has wrought midnight and dawn and day 
0	saint do you weep i hear amid the thunder
0	the fenian horses armour torn asunder 
0	laughter and cries the armies clash and shock 
0	all is done now i see the ravens flock 
0	ah cease you mournful laughing fenian horn 
0	we feasted for three days on the fourth morn
0	i found dropping sea foam on the wide stair 
0	and hung with slime and whispering in his hair 
0	that demon dull and unsubduable 
0	and once more to a day long battle fell 
0	and at the sundown threw him in the surge 
0	to lie until the fourth morn saw emerge
0	his new healed shape and for a hundred years
0	so warred so feasted with nor dreams nor fears 
0	nor languor nor fatigue and endless feast 
0	an endless war 
0	the hundred years had ceased 
0	i stood upon the stair the surges bore
0	a beech bough to me and my heart grew sore 
0	remembering how i had stood by white haired finn
0	under a beech at emen and heard the thin
0	outcry of bats 
0	and then young niam came
0	holding that horse and sadly called my name 
0	i mounted and we passed over the lone
0	and drifting grayness while this monotone 
0	surly and distant mixed inseparably
0	into the clangour of the wind and sea 
0	 i hear my soul drop down into decay 
0	 and mananan s dark tower stone by stone 
0	 gather sea slime and fall the seaward way 
0	 and the moon goad the waters night and day 
0	 that all be overthrown 
0	 but till the moon has taken all i wage
0	 war on the mightiest men under the skies 
0	 and they have fallen or fled age after age 
0	 light is man s love and lighter is man s rage 
0	 his purpose drifts and dies 
0	and then lost niam murmured love we go
0	 are empty of all power 
0	 and which of these
0	 none know she said 
0	and on my bosom laid her weeping head 
0	foam pale distance broke 
0	i mused on the chase with the fenians and bran sgeolan lomair 
0	came now the sliding of tears and sweeping of mist cold hair 
0	and now the warmth of sighs and after the quiver of lips 
0	and we stood on a sea s edge we saw not for whiter
0	than new washed fleece
0	and we rode on the plains of the sea s edge the sea s edge
0	barren and gray 
0	for no live creatures lived there no weasels moved in the dark 
0	long sighs arose in our spirits beneath us bubbled the ground 
0	and the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow night 
0	for as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams
0	of the world and the sun 
0	till the horse gave a whinny for cumbrous with stems
0	of the hazel and oak 
0	their naked and gleaming bodies poured out and heaped in the way 
0	and by them were arrow and war axe arrow and shield and blade 
0	the claws of birds 
0	grown whiter than curds 
0	his dew cumbered skies 
0	so long were they sleeping the owls had builded their nests
0	in their locks 
0	filling the fibrous dimness with long generations of eyes 
0	and the chief of the huge white creatures his knees
0	in the soft star flame 
0	lay loose in a place of shadow we drew the reins by his side 
0	and my gaze was thronged with the sleepers no 
0	not since the world began 
0	and i gazed on the bell branch sleep s forebear 
0	far sung by the sennachies 
0	snatching the horn of niam i blew a lingering note 
0	came sound from those monstrous sleepers a sound like
0	the stirring of flies 
0	i cried come out of the shadow king of the nails of gold 
0	half open his eyes were and held me dull with
0	the smoke of their dreams 
0	his lips moved slowly in answer no answer out of them came 
0	then he swayed in his fingers the bell branch slow dropping
0	a sound in faint streams
0	of the whole of my mirth 
0	in the roots of the grasses the sorrels i laid my body as low 
0	and man of the many white croziers a century there i forgot 
0	how the fetlocks drip blood in the battle when
0	the fallen on fallen lie rolled 
0	and man of the many white croziers a century there i forgot 
0	that the spear shaft is made out of ashwood the shield
0	out of ozier and hide 
0	but in dreams mild man of the croziers driving the dust
0	with their throngs 
0	moved round me of seamen or landsmen all who are winter tales 
0	came by me the kings of the red branch with roaring
0	of laughter and songs 
0	or moved as they moved once love making or piercing
0	the tempest with sails 
0	on his beard never dry 
0	dark balor as old as a forest car borne his mighty head sunk
0	helpless men lifting the lids of his weary and death making eye 
0	so lived i and lived not so wrought i and wrought not 
0	with creatures of dreams 
0	they love going by 
0	when a glow worm was green on a grass leaf lured from
0	his lair in the mould 
0	white as a shell 
0	that once more moved in my bosom the ancient sadness of man 
0	and that i would leave the immortals their dimness 
0	their dews dropping sleep 
0	i cried o niam o white one if only a twelve houred day 
0	 like me were some galley forsaken far off in meridian isle 
0	 remembering its long oared companions sails turning
0	to thread bare rags 
0	 no more to crawl on the seas with long oars mile after mile 
0	bell branch is naught 
0	 but weep for your niam o usheen weep for if only your shoe
0	 brush lightly as haymouse earth s pebbles you will come
0	no more to my side 
0	 o flaming lion of the world o when will you turn to your rest 
0	 i would die like a small withered leaf in the autumn 
0	for breast unto breast
0	 in the isles of the farthest seas where only the spirits come 
0	 were the winds less soft than the breath of a pigeon
0	who sleeps on her nest 
0	in a reverie forgetful of all things over the bubbling ground 
0	when they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast 
0	till fattening the winds of the morning an odour of new mown hay
0	if i were as i once was the strong hoofs crushing
0	the sand and the shells 
0	making way from the kindling surges i rode on a bridle path
0	or weeding or ploughing with faces a shining with much toil wet 
0	while in this place and that place with bodies unglorious 
0	their chieftains stood 
0	of wind in a wood 
0	wolves in the night 
0	so sleep thee by daytime a voice cried the fenians
0	a long time are dead 
0	a whitebeard stood hushed on the pathway the flesh
0	of his face as dried grass 
0	and in folds round his eyes and his mouth he sad
0	as a child without milk 
0	and the dreams of the islands were gone and i knew how
0	men sorrow and pass 
0	and their hound and their horse and their love and their eyes
0	that glimmer like silk 
0	 where white clouds lie spread
0	 on crevroe or broad knockfefin with many of old they feast
0	 on the floors of the gods he cried no the gods
0	a long time are dead 
0	and lonely and longing for niam i shivered and turned me about 
0	with their burden at length 
0	leaning down from the gem studded saddle i flung it
0	five yards with my hand 
0	and my years three hundred fell on me and i rose 
0	and walked on the earth 
0	a creeping old man full of sleep with the spittle
0	on his beard never dry 
0	the crozier gleams 
0	what place have caolte and conan and bran sgeolan lomair 
0	speak you too are old with your memories an old man surrounded
0	with dreams 
0	where the flesh of the footsole clingeth on the burning stones

0	leurs robes d une grande magnificence 
0	tous deux semblaient avoir le meme age ils paraissaient etre des
0	silencieux et discrets 
0	et pendant qu ils demeurerent dans l hotellerie ils ne cesserent
0	clarte s apercevait a travers les vitres du logis 
0	ouvrirons 
0	le lendemain quand on sut qu il existait deux opulents etrangers
0	figures des gens qui en sortaient etaient bien diverses les uns
0	l ame d un vieillard valait vingt pieces d or pas un penny de
0	plus car satan avait eu le temps d y former hypotheque l ame
0	d une epose en valait cinquante quand elle etait jolie ou cent
0	cheres 
0	pendant ce temps il existait dans la ville un ange de beaute la
0	 master patrick lui dit elle combien ai je de pieces d or dans
0	 cent mille 
0	 combien de bijoux 
0	 peur autant d argent 
0	 combien de chateux de bois et de terres 
0	 pour le double de ces sommes 
0	 eh bien patrick vendez tout ce qui n est pas or et
0	ceci ne faisait pas le compte dit la tradition des

0	aides par un valet infame ils penetrerent dans la retraite de la
0	lutta t elle de toutes ses forces pour sauver le contenu de son
0	coffre les larrons diaboliques furent les plus forts si ketty
0	avait eu les moyens de faire un signe de croix ajoute la legende
0	captives le larcin fut effectue alors les pauvres solliciterent
0	fourrages arrivassent en abondance des pays d orient mais huit
0	jours c etait un siecle huit jours necessitaient une somme
0	immense pour subvenir aux exigences de la disette et les pauvres
0	et ketty n avait plus une obole car elle avait abandonne son
0	chateux aux malheureux 
0	desespoir 
0	elle se rendit chez les marchands d ames 
0	 que voulez vous dirent ils 
0	 vous achetez des ames 
0	 aujourd hui je viens vous proposer un marche reprit elle 
0	 j ai une ame a vendre mais elle est chere 
0	 qu importe si elle est precieuse l ame comme le diamant 
0	s apprecie a sa blancheur 
0	 c est la mienne dit ketty 
0	les deux envoyes de satan tressaillirent leurs griffes
0	s allongerent sous leurs gants de cuir leurs yeux gris
0	etincelerent l ame pure immaculee virginale de ketty 
0	c etait une acquisition inappreciable 
0	 gentille dame combien voulez vous 
0	 cent cinquante mille ecus d or 
0	 c est fait dirent les marchands et ils tendirent a ketty un
0	parchemin cachete de noir qu elle signa en frissonnant 
0	la somme lui fut comptee 
0	des qu elle fut rentree elle dit au majordome 
0	 tenez distribuez ceci avec la somme que je vous donne les
0	puis elle s enferma et recommanda qu on ne vint pas la deranger
